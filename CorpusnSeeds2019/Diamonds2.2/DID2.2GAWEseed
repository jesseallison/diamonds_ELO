Vincent A. Cellucci & Christopher Shipman in "~getting away with everything"

"follow the yellow bit inroad" 

stockpiling serendipity 
in a server cave 
of technocracy 
like it was sarin 
and we’ve got 
an oz plot planned 
but the era of terror 
got too stale to sell 
so now there’s 
a new normal to swallow
making bygone terrorist threat levels 
look like paint by numbers 
for world travel as we are now
more or less embargoed  
contained to a dull panic
pandemic 8 weeks reborn
alone, unformed ironically 
by being over-informed despite 
less ado about everything 
big data eats the little 
isolation worm afraid
of where the sidewalk begins
or just going to the store
ricocheting to the voids
of the aisles with more
end times supplies on your person
than even purchasing
vices and devices little 
more than morning chores
I’ve taken to fondly singeing 
my bare hand on the teapot
to taste a past life 
spoons are the only utensils
I continue to use 
not for measuring my life
but for devouring the jot of stock one can 
still render from three millennia old marrow  
and when I can muster the courage
to expound upon my jettisoned position
I chronicle my life of limited rebellion 
crouching towards the desire to see 
an even fuller spectrum 
hopping fences        peaking on mountains 
risking insanity for sanity
willingly jigsawing the heart 
to reassemble with anyone that fascinates
me and cares enough to abandon  
their own assured understandings 
for adventures full as moon
over dense cities itching
to crawl with pleasure again
     push past forces of the state
that have never represented 
interest besides their golden own
not that I haven’t striven to
become more than mere anarchy 
a pusherman of language
and the experience to wield it
evermore flirting with the outer rims
of rhyme going as far as publishing fuck poems 
yet partnered up with a 9 to 5         2 mortgages
actually contemplating pushing a stroller 
and definitely for the first time 
since the pinch of adolescence 
a more sober than not disposition
I debate how much I have settled 
an extent I may have hurled farther 
at the expense of my liberty or life itself 
I did flee a country I could no longer bear 
enabling and intermittently I agonize 
about what that makes me some eves 
more of a daybreak dreamer 
than a resistance deserter
others a civil disobedient
ghost sheltering in a library 
by working with silence and white space
even before we all had to shelter in place
certainly an expert at starting from scratch 
I speak my mind when I care to      which is less and less
and right now—world over—there is an invisible plague
which begs the declaration we will all die in any language
one way or several so there’s really no getting away
but on a page or in a virtual space          deprived of 
the senses that           on occasion    
make rotting for eternity almost bearable 
although just beginning to code
I know now that our machines
promise to exceed us
as the only lifetime learners
that can ignore death
maybe we should listen 
a little more closely 
to their songs
I heard a good one yesterday
claim in its outro
we want revolution 
constant change	
give to everyone	
food and clothes
kill the government kill the system 
kill the government kill the system
if that’s the AI revolution sapiens have 
been so afraid of let’s
follow the update upstage 
 

"An American Wake"
 
It is not forbidden yet		   to play the jester
so the boss man wears his “o-so-contemporary!” cap
          to the obligatory office party; 
         you know 
           the one:

the sad American red		        snapback shaped 
         like an oubliette— 

wild as the masses 		          at half-mast;
strange 
as the bigotry sweating the need 
now to hide beneath it—for the first time—
			its infinite strands.

Let us consider one story:     Every strand a seashore 
disappearing.                                                Every bit 
of stubble a spike—a blade contending 
                                ownership of sand and retracting 
equal rights
 	like shadows 
cast over shadows. 

A literal littoral        foaming white
                                 flooded with blacked-out ghosts 
of black bodies is not           
a metaphorical leap.                                              We

born betrothed to the past                   see what is lost 
in the long                            divorce 
                                             because it’s caught 
                                             on film.     

	I suppose it’s alright to tell you—
	I suppose you already know— 
something the opposite 
of Wordsworthian
has my tongue by 
its pincers.

So I tell the jokes I know to the people I know 
backed into the corners I know.                        Here       

I shake my fist                  rattle    
the glassy ice disappearing                      and begin 

disappearing

toward the bar. I am an ocean 
falling on the walkable world. 

I might as well grow wings because     I know how
to fool everyone—could force fun from an egg cup 
                                          (if you have one handy). 

I can like a nest fashion a laugh 
out of white feathers			
and white sky.

As in sharp against. As in dull against. 
As in the screwed up punchline. As in
the usual disappointments. As in 

the big boss man                           clamoring around 
the obligatory office party                       pretending 
everything

                        above / below 
            the unbroken bill 
            of his numbly contemporary cap	   

        	   		         isn’t falling 
              from the sky.

If we can cast an eye
toward the deluge 
as even the horizon grows small and dim

sinking itself into the sea as if into a dusty corner’s
forgotten spill—
if we can 
reimagine a shore             its sun fastened
to another rise— 
                                    stand firm at its water’s edge
 
             maybe any voice                               backed 
into any corner            
                                        
won’t cease to speak                 until the sky ceases
to fall.			     

                               The sky is never finished	
		                so nothing is.
