Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a\~\line hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and\~\line its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes.\~\line 
We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over\~\line traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business\~\line buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we\~\line approach downtown section, the character of the city begins\~
\line to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We\~\line see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-\~\line vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.\~\line 
vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of\~\line nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.\~\line \line We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific\~\line 
location. A skinny, high old hotel comes o view. On its\~\line exposed brick side great big letters advertise "Transients-\~\line Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough\~\line to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open,
\~\line curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so\~\line characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward\~\line with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is\~\line raised as high as
 it can go, but the shade is pulled down to\~\line three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants\~\line of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are\~\line close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame\~\line 
is in shot. No sounds come from within the room.\~\line \line Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between\~\line shade and sill, peep o the room.\~\line \line A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears\~\line 
a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude\~\line of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of\~\line the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome\~\line conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl\~
\line nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.\~\line \line A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure\~\line visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then\~\line start forward. As we pass under the window shade,\~
\line \line  \~\line \line A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow\~\line bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the\~\line bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-\~\line 
top handbag are on the bureau.\~\line \line On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-\~\line Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There\~\line is no radio.\~\line \line The man standing by the bed, wear
ing only trousers, T-shirt\~\line and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man\~\line with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting\~\line his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at\~\line 
Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps\~\line her face turned away from him.\~\line \line After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans\~\line over and takes Mary o his arms, kisses her long and warmly,\~\line 
holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed\~\line and finally errupted by the buzzing closeness of an\~\line inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow\~\line Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns\~
\line at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, imate,\~\line playful voice.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Never did eat your lunch, did you.\~\line \line Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her,\~\line 
kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings\~\line her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds\~\line her shoes, slips her feet o searches them. And finally\~\line pulls away and sits up.\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
I better get back to the office.\~\line These ended lunch hours give my\~\line boss excess acid.\~\line \line She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings\~\line out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or\~\line 
perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam\~\line watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery,\~\line humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they\~\line occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.\~
\line \line SAM\~\line Call your boss and tell him you're\~\line taking the rest of the afternoon\~\line off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (soft sarcasm)\~\line What do I do with my free afternoon,\~\line 
walk you to the airport?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (meaningfully)\~\line We could laze around here a while\~\line longer.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels\~\line of this sort aren't erested in\~\line 
you when you come in, but when your\~\line time's up...\~\line (a small anguish)\~\line Sam, I hate having to be with you in\~\line a place like this.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I've heard of married couples who\~\line deliberately spend occasional nights\~
\line in cheap hotels. They say it...\~\line \line MARY\~\line (errupting)\~\line When you're married you can do a lot\~\line of things deliberately.\~\line \line SAM\~\line You sure talk like a girl who's been\~\line married.\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
Sam!\~\line \line SAM\~\line I'm sorry, Mary.\~\line (after a moment)\~\line My old Dad used to say 'when you\~\line can't change a situation, laugh at\~\line it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like\~\line laughing at it.\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
I've lost my girlish laughter.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (observing)\~\line The only girlish thing you have lost.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (a meaningful quiet,\~\line then, with difficulty:)\~\line Sam. This is the last time.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
For what?\~\line \line MARY\~\line This! Meeting you in secret so we\~\line can be... secretive! You come down\~\line here on business trips and we steal\~\line lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't\~\line even come.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
Okay. What do we do instead, write\~\line each other lurid love letters?\~\line \line MARY\~\line (about to argue, then\~\line turning away)\~\line I haven't time to argue. I'm a working\~\line girl.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
And I'm a working man! We're a regular\~\line working-class tragedy!\~\line (he laughs)\~\line \line MARY\~\line It is tragic! Or it will be... if we\~\line go on meeting in shabby hotels\~\line whenever you can find a tax-deductible\~\line 
excuse for flying down deductible\~\line here...\~\line \line SAM\~\line (errupting,\~\line seriously)\~\line You can't laugh at it, huh?\~\line \line MARY\~\line Can you?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Sure. It's like laughing through a\~\line 
broken jaw, but...\~\line \line He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window,\~\line tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.\~\line \line It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares o the room,\~\line 
revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if\~\line corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the\~\line fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor\~\line again.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
And besides, when you say I make tax-\~\line deductible excuses you make me out a\~\line criminal.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (having to smile)\~\line You couldn't be a criminal if you\~\line committed a major crime.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
I wish I were. Not an active criminal\~\line but... a nice guy with the conscience\~\line of a criminal.\~\line (goes close to mary,\~\line touches her)\~\line N best thing to no conscience at\~\line all.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (pulling away)\~\line 
I have to go, Sam.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I can come down n week.\~\line \line MARY\~\line No.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Not even just to see you, to have\~\line lunch... in public?\~\line \line MARY\~\line We can see each other, we can even\~\line 
have dinner... but respectably, in\~\line my house with my mother's picture on\~\line the mantel and my sister helping me\~\line broil a big steak for three!\~\line \line SAM\~\line And after the steak... do we send\~\line 
Sister to the movies and turn Mama's\~\line picture to the wall?\~\line \line MARY\~\line Sam! No!\~\line \line SAM\~\line (after a pause, simply)\~\line All right.\~\line \line She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue\~\line 
the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised\~\line when they discover men will continue to want them even after\~\line the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly,\~\line 
places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and\~\line simple sincerity.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-\~\line deductible or not, I want to see\~\line deductible you. And under any\~\line conditions.\~\line 
(a smile)\~\line Even respectability.\~\line \line MARY\~\line You make respectability sound...\~\line disrespectful.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (brightly)\~\line I'm all for it! It requires patience\~\line and temperance and a lot of sweating-\~\line 
out... otherwise, though, it's only\~\line hard work.\~\line (a pause)\~\line But if I can see you, touch you even\~\line as simply as this... I won't mind.\~\line \line He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems\~\line 
crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I'm fed up with sweating for people\~\line who aren't there. I sweat to pay off\~\line my father's debts... and he's in his\~\line grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife\~\line 
alimony, and she's living on the\~\line other side of the world somewhere.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (a smile)\~\line I pay, too. They also pay who meet\~\line in hotel rooms.\~\line \line SAM\~\line A couple of years and the debts will\~\line 
be paid off. And if she ever re-\~\line marries, the alimony stops... and\~\line then...\~\line \line MARY\~\line I haven't even been married once\~\line yet!\~\line \line SAM\~\line Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
(smiling, then with a\~\line terrible urgency)\~\line Sam, let's go get married.\~\line \line SAM\~\line And live with me in a storeroom behind\~\line a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll\~\line have a lot of laughs. When I send my\~\line 
ex-wife her money, you can lick the\~\line stamps.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (a deep desperation)\~\line I'll lick the stamps.\~\line \line He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly,\~\line looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.
\~\line \line SAM\~\line You know what I'd like? A clear,\~\line empty sky... and a plane, and us in\~\line it... and somewhere a private island\~\line for sale, where we can run around\~\line without our... shoes on. And the\~\line 
wherewithal to buy what I'd like.\~\line (he moves away,\~\line suddenly serious)\~\line Mary, you want to cut this off, go\~\line out and find yourself someone\~\line available.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'm thinking of it.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
(a cheerful shout)\~\line How can you even think a thing like\~\line that!\~\line \line MARY\~\line (picking up handbag,\~\line starting for door)\~\line Don't miss your plane.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Hey, we can leave together can't we?\~\line \line MARY
\~\line (at door)\~\line I'm late... and you have to put your\~\line shoes on.\~\line \line Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares\~\line down at his shoeless feet,\~\line \line :\~\line \line  DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE\~
\line \line Shooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly\~\line to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A\~\line cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay\~\line driver, cross pavement to the office door.\~\line \line  OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her\~\line temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last\~\line of her teens.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?\~\line \line CAROLINE\~\line 
(a high, bright, eager-\~\line to-talk voice laced\~\line to-with a vague Texan\~\line accent)\~\line He's lunching with the man who's\~\line buying the Harris Street property,\~\line you know, that oil lease man... so\~\line that's why he's late.\~\line 
(a pause, then, as\~\line Mary does not respond\~\line to the poed thrust)\~\line You getting a headache?\~\line \line MARY\~\line It'll pass. Headaches are like\~\line resolutions... you forget them soon\~\line as they stop hurting.\~\line \line CAROLINE
\~\line You got aspirins? I have something...\~\line not aspirins, but\~\line (cheerfully takes\~\line bottle of pills out\~\line of desk drawer)\~\line my mother's doctor gave these to me\~\line the day of my wedding.\~\line (laughs)\~\line 
Teddy was furious when he found out\~\line I'd taken tranquilizers!\~\line \line She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Were there any calls?\~\line \line CAROLINE\~\line Teddy called. Me... And my mother\~\line 
called to see if Teddy called. Oh,\~\line and your sister called to say she's\~\line going to Tucson to do some buying\~\line and she'll be gone the whole weekend\~\line and...\~\line \line She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening.\~
\line MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the\~\line office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a\~\line trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-\~\line 
hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful\~\line vulgarity.\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls\~\line should get your boss to air-condition\~\line you up. He can afford it today.\~\line \line 
Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead\~\line Cassidy toward the private office.\~\line \line LOWERY\~\line Mary, will you get those copies of\~\line the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.\~\line \line Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hook
s a haunch onto the\~\line desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little\~\line girl...\~\line (laughs as Mary looks\~\line up at him)\~\line Not you, my daughter! A baby, and\~\line 
tomorrow she stands up there and\~\line gets her sweet self married away\~\line from me!\~\line (pulling out wallet)\~\line I want you to look at my baby.\~\line Eighteen years old... and she's never\~\line had an unhappy day in any one of\~\line 
those years!\~\line (flashes photo)\~\line \line Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some\~\line remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore\~\line the man's hot-breath closeness.\~\line \line LOWERY\~\line 
Come on, Tom, my office is air-\~\line conditioned.\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line (ignoring Lowery)\~\line You know what I do with unhappiness?\~\line I buy it off! You unhappy?\~\line \line MARY\~\line Not inordinately.\~\line (puts deed copy o\~\line 
Cassidy's too-close\~\line hand)\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line I'm buying this house for my baby's\~\line wedding present. Forty thousand\~\line dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying\~\line happiness, that's buying off\~\line unhappiness! That penniless punk
\~\line she's marryin'...\~\line (laughs)\~\line Probably a good kid... it's just\~\line that I hate him.\~\line (looks at deed)\~\line Yup! Forty thousand, says here...\~\line (to Lowery)\~\line Casharoonie!\~\line \line 
He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of\~\line new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's\~\line nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious\~\line green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk.
\~\line Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the\~\line bills, laughs wickedly.\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line I never carry more than I can afford\~\line to lose!\~\line (closer to Mary)\~\line Count 'em!\~\line \line LOWERY\~\line 
(shocked, worried)\~\line Tom... cash transactions of this\~\line size! Most irregular...\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line So what? It's my private money!\~\line (laughs, winks, elbows\~\line Lowery)\~\line And now it's yours.\~\line \line CAROLINE\~\line 
(staring at the money)\~\line I declare!\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line (whispering)\~\line I don't! That's how I'm able to keep\~\line it!\~\line (laughs)\~\line \line LOWERY\~\line (hastily errupting)\~\line Suppose we just put this in the safe\~\line 
and then Monday morning when you're\~\line feeling good...\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line Speakin' of feeling good, where's\~\line that bottle you said you had in your\~\line desk...\~\line (laughs, as if having\~\line given away Lowery's\~\line secret)\~
\line Oops!\~\line (to Mary, patting her\~\line arm)\~\line Usually I can keep my mouth shut!\~\line \line He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks\~\line to Mary, meaningfully.\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line Honest
. I can keep any private\~\line transaction a secret... any pri....\~\line (stopped by Mary's\~\line cold gaze)\~\line Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!\~\line \line Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has\~\line 
gone o Lower's office.\~\line \line LOWERY\~\line (quietly)\~\line I don't even want it in the office\~\line over the weekend. Put it in the safe\~\line deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And\~\line we'll get him to give us a check on\~\line 
Monday - instead.\~\line \line He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going\~\line to come and pull him bodily o the office. When the men\~\line are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle,\~\line smiles at it.\~\line \line 
CAROLINE\~\line He was flirting with you. I guess he\~\line noticed my wedding ring.\~\line \line Mary has put one bundle o a large envelope and takes the\~\line other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the\~\line 
filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed\~\line copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office\~\line door, knocks, starts to open door as:\~\line \line LOWERY (O.S.)\~\line Come in.\~\line \line 
 LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large\~\line tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary\~\line remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk,\~\line 
talking as she goes.\~\line \line MARY\~\line The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't\~\line mind, I'd like to go right on home\~\line after the bank. I have a slight...\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line You go right home! Me and your boss\~\line 
are going out to get ourselves a\~\line little drinkin' done!\~\line (to Lowery)\~\line Right?\~\line \line LOWERY\~\line (to Mary)\~\line Of course. You feeling ill?\~\line \line MARY\~\line A headache.\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line 
You need a week-end in Las Vegas...\~\line playground of the world!\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'm going to spend this week-end in\~\line bed.\~\line (starts out)\~\line \line CASSIDY\~\line (to Lowery)\~\line Only playground that beats Las Vegas!\~\line 
\line Mary goes back out o the outer office, closes door.\~\line \line  OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make\~\line sure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down o it.\~\line During this:\~\line 
\line CAROLINE\~\line Aren't you going to take the pills?\~\line (as Mary shakes her\~\line head)\~\line They'll knock that headache out.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I don't need pills... just sleep.\~\line \line She goes to the door.\~\line \line DISSOLVE:
\~\line \line  MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)\~\line \line A double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as\~\line the CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only\~\line in her slip. Perhaps she is about to get o bed. Behind\~\line 
her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any\~\line contents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to\~\line show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side\~\line of the bed.\~\line \line 
Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on\~\line as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed\~\line suitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then\~\line brings some final garments from the closet.\~\line 
\line She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top.\~\line Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an\~\line impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.\~\line \line 
The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then\~\line takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled\~\line envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she\~\line looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small
\~\line file-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those\~\line brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and\~\line policies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly,\~\line 
puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her\~\line bank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the\~\line file-envelope and the bank book, o her handbag, takes one\~\line quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and
\~\line the suitcase and goes out of the room.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)\~\line \line A two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in\~\line the driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily\~\line 
read the Arizona number plate in the foreground.\~\line \line Mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, ending to\~\line put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase\~\line and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car,\~
\line begins to back out of driveway.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\~\line \line We are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled,\~\line guilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care\~
\line of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic\~\line irregularity. She stops for a red light at a main\~\line ersection.\~\line \line FROM MARY'S VIEWPO - (DAY)\~\line \line We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right\~
\line in front of Mary's car.\~\line \line MARY'S CAR - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary freezes.\~\line \line  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\~\line \line Cassidy, glancing o car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery\~\line exclamation, elbows Lowe
ry. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles\~\line pleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.\~\line \line MARY'S CAR - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror\~\line on her face.\~\line \line  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\~
\line \line Now we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a\~\line small confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary\~\line ended to "spend the weekend in bed." He considers,\~\line 
curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his\~\line face.\~\line \line MARY'S CAR - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary sees the pause and the look.\~\line \line  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\~\line \line 
For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to\~\line cross back to the car.\~\line \line MARY'S CAR - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the\~\line shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.\~\line 
\line Mary zooms the car away.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  HIGHWAY - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is\~\line less tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she\~\line 
checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas\~\line station.\~\line \line FAST DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line MARY'S CAR - (DAY)\~\line \line Approaching and leaving city limits.\~\line \line MARY - (DAY)\~\line \line Looks at gas gauge.\~
\line \line C.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)\~\line \line  A GAS STATION - (DAY)\~\line \line We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no\~\line other cars about, this being a gas station off the main\~\line 
highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary\~\line looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face\~\line turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.\~\line \line 
No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as\~\line if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that\~\line she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty.\~\line She has to blow her horn.\~\line \line 
A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.\~\line \line At that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the\~\line shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's\~\line 
car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's\~\line insistent ringing unnerves Mary.\~\line \line She starts her car, zooms off.\~\line \line We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack.\~\line 
He looks after the departing car with little or no expression.\~\line \line CAR\~\line \line The car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is\~\line setting. There is something vaguely ominous about the\~\line 
darkening sky o which the car seems to be disappearing.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line MARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)\~\line \line The oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting\~\line sleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close,\~\line 
involuntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as\~\line if forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to\~\line glare to a po beyond endurance. She murmurs "Sam - Sam."\~\line \line LONG LAP DISSOLVE:\~\line \line 
 ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)\~\line \line We see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft\~\line shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like\~\line a child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear\~\line 
that the car is empty.\~\line \line After a moment, during which there are no other vehicles\~\line passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY\~\line PATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its\~\line app
arent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car.\~\line He gets out and approaches the driver's side window.\~\line \line  MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line The Patrolman looks down o the car.\~\line \line  CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPO\~\line \line 
Mary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved\~\line by the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex,\~\line turns the ignition and presses down on the starter.\~\line \line  CAR (DAWN)\~\line \line 
The Patrolman holds up his hand.\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line (startled)\~\line Hold it there!\~\line \line Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together.\~\line The Patrolman raps again, less gently.\~\line \line 
Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies\~\line her for a moment.\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line In quite a hurry.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Yes.\~\line (because he seems to\~\line be awaiting an\~\line explanation)\~\line 
I didn't mean to sleep so long. I\~\line was afraid I'd have an accident last\~\line night, from sleepiness... so I decided\~\line to pull over...\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line You slept here all night?\~\line \line MARY\~\line (a fa edge of\~\line 
defensiveness)\~\line Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my\~\line eyes...\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line (mere concern)\~\line There are plenty of motels in this\~\line area. You should have... I mean,\~\line just to be safe...\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
I didn't end to sleep all night!\~\line I just pulled over... have I broken\~\line any laws?\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line No, m'am.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Then I'm free to go...?\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line (a pause)\~\line Is anything wrong?\~\line 
\line MARY\~\line Of course not! Am I acting as if...\~\line something's wrong?\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line (almost a smile)\~\line Frankly, yes.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Please... I'd like to go...\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line Is there?\~\line \line 
MARY\~\line Is there what?\~\line (not waiting for an\~\line answer)\~\line I've told you there's nothing wrong...\~\line except that I'm in a hurry and you're\~\line taking up my time...\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line (errupting, sternly)\~\line 
Now wait just a moment! Turn your\~\line motor off, please.\~\line \line Mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off\~\line the ignition.\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line In the course of my duty, I never\~\line 
"take up" anyone's time, whether\~\line it's to give a warning, or a ticket,\~\line or help! Believe that, M'am.\~\line (a little softer)\~\line Now if you woke up on the wrong side\~\line of... the car seat, that's one thing.\~\line But wh
en you act as if I've just\~\line placed you under arrest...\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'm sorry.\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line No need to apologize...\~\line \line Mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the\~\line 
matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone.\~\line The Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who\~\line demands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit\~\line too abrupt. He calls:\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line 
Wait a minute!\~\line \line MARY\~\line (jamming down the\~\line brake)\~\line Now what?\~\line \line The Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~\line May I see your license?\~\line \line MARY\~\line Why?\~\line \line PATROLMAN\~
\line Please.\~\line \line Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed\~\line it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in\~\line it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.\~\line \line The Patrolman is staring at her. S
he glances at him nervously,\~\line pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to\~\line remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling\~\line her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then\~\line 
the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other\~\line items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet,\~\line opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at\~\line the car.\~\line \line  ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)\~\line 
\line The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks\~\line the license plate, and returns.\~\line \line  MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the\~\line steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet.
\~\line \line She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment.\~\line \line He says nothing. She starts ahead, fast.\~\line \line  ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)\~\line \line The Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts\~\line 
back to his automobile.\~\line \line MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line She is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great\~\line deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger.\~\line She is disturbed and a
ngry and frightened at her inability\~\line to act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives,\~\line she glances o her rear-view mirror.\~\line \line MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)\~\line \line 
The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind\~\line her at a matched speed.\~\line \line MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line She glances out at her surroundings.\~\line \line MARY'S POV - (DAWN)\~\line \line The Freeway ahead.\~\line \line 
 MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line She suddenly turns off the highway.\~\line \line MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line She checks her mirror.\~\line \line MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)\~\line \line The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off
\~\line after her.\~\line \line MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)\~\line \line She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick\~\line decision.\~\line \line DISSOLVE:\~\line \line  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\~\line \line 
The big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise."\~\line We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out\~\line of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention\~\line 
to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on\~\line all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line With you in a second!\~\line \line Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making\~
\line a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand\~\line on the corner, just outside the lot.\~\line \line She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is\~\line fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy\~\line 
herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot,\~\line picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back o the car\~\line lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes,\~\line we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same\~
\line PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite\~\line side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in\~\line the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see\~\line the Patrolman.\~\line \line The car dealer is out 
on the lot now, standing and waiting\~\line for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line I'm in no mood for trouble!\~\line \line MARY\~\line (glancing up, thrown\~\line for a moment)\~\line What?\~\line 
\line CAR DEALER\~\line (cheerfully)\~\line There's an old saying, "First customer\~\line of the day is always the most\~\line trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no\~\line mood for it so I'm just going to\~\line treat you so fair and square you\~\line 
won't have one human reason to give\~\line me...\~\line \line MARY\~\line (errupting)\~\line Can I trade in my car and take\~\line another?\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line You can do anything you've a mind\~\line to... and bein' a woman, you will!\~\line 
(chin-indicating her\~\line car)\~\line That yours?\~\line \line MARY\~\line Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it,\~\line I'm just...\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line Sick of the sight of it!\~\line (laughs)\~\line Well, suppose you look around for\~\line 
something that strikes your eyes and\~\line meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give\~\line yours the once over and... want some\~\line coffee? I was just about...\~\line \line MARY\~\line No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I\~\line 
just want to make a change and\~\line start...\~\line \line She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the\~\line Patrolman.\~\line \line THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)\~\line \line He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.\~\line 
\line  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary has to force herself to look away.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line One thing people never ought to be\~\line when they're buying a used car is in\~\line a hurry!\~\line (starting away toward\~\line her car)\~
\line But like I said, too nice a day for\~\line arguing. I'll just shoot this o\~\line the garage.\~\line \line He starts o Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic,\~\line wanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the\~\line 
presence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing\~\line cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be\~\line followed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay\~\line here.\~\line \line 
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.\~\line The Car Dealer has driven her car o the garage. She stands\~\line in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target.\~\line She looks toward the garage.\~\line \line 
THE GARAGE - MARY'S POV - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary's car is in it.\~\line \line  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further\~\line suspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman.\~\line \line 
THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)\~\line \line He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she\~\line goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line That's the one I'd've picked for you\~\line 
myself!\~\line \line MARY\~\line How much?\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line Go ahead! Spin it around the block.\~\line Now I know you don't know anything\~\line about engine condition, but you can\~\line feel, can't you... and it's all in\~\line 
the feel, believe me, you feel that\~\line one around the block...\~\line \line MARY\~\line It looks fine. How much will it be,\~\line with my car...?\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line You mean you don't want the usual\~\line day and a half to think it over?
\~\line (laughs)\~\line You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin'\~\line you?\~\line \line MARY\~\line Of course not. Please.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line Well... heck, this is the first time\~\line I ever saw the customer high-pressure\~\line the salesman!
\~\line (laughs, sees she is\~\line in no mood for it)\~\line I'd figure roughly...\~\line (looks at the car,\~\line then back at the\~\line garage)\~\line ...your car plus five hundred.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Five hundred.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~
\line Aha! Always got time to argue money,\~\line huh...?\~\line \line MARY\~\line All right.\~\line \line As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches\~\line o her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line 
(slowly)\~\line I take it... you can prove that car's\~\line yours... I mean, out of state and\~\line all... got your pink slip and your...\~\line \line MARY\~\line I think I have the necessary papers.\~\line Is there a Ladies Room...\~\line \line 
CAR DEALER\~\line In the building ...\~\line (indicates, continues\~\line to stare quietly)\~\line Mary starts for the building, glancing\~\line once in the direction of the\~\line Patrolman.\~\line \line THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)\~\line \line 
He still sits, his motor throbbing, his face quiet.\~\line \line  THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\~\line \line Mary goes o the office building.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  LADIES ROOM - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Mary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag,\~\line racts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off\~\line five, puts the bundle back o the envelope and the envelope\~\line back o the bag. Then she remembers, takes out the important
\~\line papers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having\~\line to do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the\~\line envelope, starts out of the ladies Room.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\~\line \line 
The Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the\~\line line. It stands in the clearing.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line (too cheerfully)\~\line I think you'd better give it a trial\~\line spin. Don't want any bad word of\~\line 
mouth about California Charlie.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'd really rather not. Please. Can't\~\line we just settle this and...\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line I'll be perfectly honest with you,\~\line Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust\~\line you, but...
\~\line \line MARY\~\line (errupting)\~\line But what? Is there anything so\~\line terribly wrong about... making a\~\line decision and wanting to hurry? Do\~\line you think I've stolen... my car?\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line N
o, M'am. I was only about to say,\~\line I've sent my mechanic out to give\~\line your car a little test... that's\~\line all.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (handing him the\~\line ownership papers and\~\line the new bills)\~\line 
I'd like to be ready when he gets\~\line back.\~\line \line CAR DEALER\~\line Okay. If you'll come along...\~\line \line He starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely,\~\line anxiously. She glances, sees:\~\line \line 
THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)\~\line \line He is still at the far curb.\~\line \line  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\~\line \line The Car Dealer goes o his office. Mary follows.\~\line \line THE PATROLMAN - (DAY)\~\line \line 
A second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic,\~\line comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He\~\line pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the\~\line office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's
\~\line car is driven back onto the lot.\~\line \line The MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the\~\line Patrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he\~\line is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office.\~\line 
In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car,\~\line gets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells:\~\line \line MECHANIC\~\line Hey! Miss?\~\line \line Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic.\~\line 
Her face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her.\~\line Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (as Mechanic reaches\~\line car)\~\line Just put it right in here, please...\~\line beside me.\~\line 
\line The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off.\~\line As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer\~\line and the Patrolman all looking after her.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE\~\line 
\line Mary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is\~\line more shocked than pleased when she sees...\~\line \line MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR\~\line \line No sign of the Patrolman.\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE\~\line \line 
She turns her face, looks out at the highway.\~\line \line ROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV\~\line \line It is heavy with traffic.\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE\~\line \line Again she checks the mirror and although...\~\line \line MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR\~
\line \line There is still no sign of the Patrolman.\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE\~\line \line She cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that\~\line nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions.\~\line \line 
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety,\~\line her fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a\~\line person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this\~\line realistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the
\~\line Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it\~\line in her imagination. The "imagined voice" we hear is actually\~\line the voice of the Car Dealer:\~\line \line CAR DEALER'S VOICE\~\line Heck, Officer, that was the first\~\line 
time I ever saw the Customer high-\~\line pressure the Salesman! Somebody\~\line chasing her?\~\line \line PATROLMAN'S VOICE\~\line I better have a look at those papers,\~\line Charlie.\~\line \line CAR DEALER'S VOICE\~\line 
She look like a wrong-one to you?\~\line \line PATROLMAN'S VOICE\~\line Acted like one.\~\line \line Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away\~\line these voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view\~\line mirror.\~\line \line 
MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR\~\line \line Still no sight of the Patrolman.\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR\~\line \line She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when\~\line she is sprung to tension again by....\~\line \line  HIGHWAY\~\line \line 
The sight of a police car. As she drives past, we hear the\~\line squeaky, unelligible voice coming over the car radio.\~\line Mary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead.\~\line \line DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\~\line \line  HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT\~\line \line 
Mary's car dashing along.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR\~\line \line Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving.\~\line Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.\~\line \line OUT THE WINDSHIELD\~\line \line 
We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.\~\line \line MARY IN NEW CAR\~\line \line We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an ercom system,\~\line a sound emanating from Mary's imagination.\~\line \line 
After the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.\~\line \line CAROLINE'S VOICE\~\line Yes, Mr. Lowery.\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line (a worried tone)\~\line Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?\~\line \line CAROLINE'S VOICE\~\line 
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's\~\line always a bit late on Monday mornings.\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line Buzz me the minute she comes in.\~\line \line Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing\~\line 
these "invented" scenes of her imagination.\~\line \line  HIGHWAY\~\line \line Now we  the view of the road, from Mary's viewpo\~\line Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see\~\line the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations
\~\line beginning to blaze on.\~\line \line  MARY'S NEW CAR\~\line \line Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices\~\line again:\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line Call her sister! If no one's answering\~\line at the house....\~\line 
\line CAROLINE'S VOICE\~\line I called her sister, Mr. Lowery,\~\line where she works, the Music Makers\~\line Music Store, you know? And she doesn't\~\line know where Mary is any more than we\~\line do.\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line 
You better run out to the house.\~\line She may be... unable to answer the\~\line phone...\~\line \line CAROLINE'S VOICE\~\line Her sister's going to do that. She's\~\line as worried as we are.\~\line \line 
A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face.\~\line She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.\~\line \line  HIGHWAY\~\line \line We cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights\~\line slash at the windshield.\~\line \line 
 MARY'S NEW CAR\~\line \line Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of\~\line her face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights\~\line blurt at her.\~\line \line Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as\~
\line if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break\~\line through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her\~\line imagination blank.\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line No! I haven't the faest idea. As\~\line 
I said, I last saw your sister when\~\line she left this office on Friday...\~\line she said she didn't feel well and\~\line wanted to leave early and I said she\~\line could. And that was the last I saw...\~\line (a pause, a thought)\~\line 
...wait a minute, I did see her, an\~\line hour or so later, driving...\~\line (a pause, then with\~\line solemn fear)\~\line Ah, I think you'd better come over\~\line here to my office. Quick.\~\line (a pause, a click)\~\line Carolin
e, get Mr. Cassidy for me.\~\line \line  HIGHWAY\~\line \line It is completely dark now, night.\~\line \line  MARY'S NEW CAR\~\line \line We cut back to her face.\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line After all, Cassidy, I told you...\~\line 
all that cash... I'm not taking the\~\line responsibility... Oh, for heaven's\~\line sake, a girl works for you for ten\~\line years, you trust her! All right,\~\line yes, you better come over.\~\line \line FROM MARY'S VIEWPO\~\line \line 
 THE ROAD AHEAD  MARY'S NEW CAR\~\line \line Fast cut back to Mary's face. Oncoming headlights throw a\~\line blinding light across her features.\~\line \line CASSIDY'S VOICE\~\line (undrunk, sharp with\~\line rage)\~\line 
Well I ain't about to kiss off forty\~\line thousand dollars! I'll get it back\~\line and if any of it's missin' I'll\~\line replace it with her fine soft flesh!\~\line I'll track her, never you doubt it!\~\line \line LOWERY'S VOICE\~\line 
Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't\~\line believe... it must be some kind of a\~\line mystery... I can't...\~\line \line CASSIDY'S VOICE\~\line You checked with the bank, no? They\~\line never laid eyes on her, no? You\~\line 
still trustin'? Hot creepers, she\~\line sat there while I dumped it out...\~\line hardly even looked at it, plannin'\~\line and... and even flirtin' with me...!\~\line \line A look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.\~\line \line 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN\~\line \line Big drops of rain begin to appear.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - MARY\~\line \line She is becoming aware of the rain starting.\~\line \line THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\~\line \line The 
rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - MARY\~\line \line Mary starts the windshield wipers.\~\line \line THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\~\line \line The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.\~\line \line 
CLOSEUP - MARY\~\line \line Peering through the blurred windshield.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS\~\line \line slowing down in the flooding highway.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - MARY\~\line \line 
peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS\~\line \line almost coming to a slow turn.\~\line \line THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\~\line \line just blackness and rain.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - MARY\~\line 
\line peering.\~\line \line MARY'S VIEWPO\~\line \line An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon\~\line sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield.\~\line \line MARY'S CAR\~\line \line 
She presses down, forces the car to move on through the\~\line flooded road.\~\line \line  THE ROAD\~\line \line As we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can\~\line faly make out the large letters which read "Motel." Mary\~\line 
stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see\~\line the sign clearly now: "BATES MOTEL." Mary opens the car door\~\line and dashes out o the rain and up onto the porch of the\~\line motel office.\~\line \line  BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\~
\line \line Mary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office.\~\line She tries door, finds it open, goes o office. CAMERA\~\line FOLLOWS her o office. There is no one present. Mary goes\~\line 
to the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response.\~\line Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes\~\line back out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction,\~\line slightly behind the office, and sees...\~\line \line 
MARY'S VIEWPO - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house.\~\line There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN\~\line passes the window, pauses, peers out.\~\line \line 
We see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from\~\line the window.\~\line \line  PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get\~\line some attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.\~
\line \line No one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes\~\line out o the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window,\~\line begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open\~\line 
the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path.\~\line After a few steps, he turns and runs back o the house.\~\line Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the\~\line porch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back\~
\line only to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to\~\line the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his\~\line hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached\~\line it.\~\line \line He stops short, looks
 at her, then at the umbrella hanging\~\line useless in his hand, then back to her.\~\line \line There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look.\~\line Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him\~\line 
almost smile. He gestures her o the office, standing back\~\line to indicate that he will go after her. She goes o the\~\line office.\~\line \line  OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\~\line \line The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN
\~\line BATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-\~\line spoken and hesitant.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Dirty night.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (not really a question)\~\line You have a vacancy?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (simply, almost
\~\line cheerfully)\~\line We have twelve vacancies. Twelve\~\line cabins, twelve vacancies.\~\line (a pause)\~\line They moved away the highway.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I thought I'd gotten off the main...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
I knew you must have. No one stops\~\line here anymore unless they do.\~\line \line He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration\~\line book.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line But it's no good dwelling on our\~\line 
losses, is it. We go right ahead\~\line lighting signs and following the\~\line formalities... Would you sign,\~\line please.\~\line \line Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the\~\line 
registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with\~\line the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes\~\line the name Marie Samuels.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Your home address. Oh, just the town\~\line will do.\~\line \line MARY
\~\line (glancing at newspaper\~\line sticking out of her\~\line handbag)\~\line Los Angeles.\~\line \line She realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write\~\line it down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false\~\line name. Nor
man smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Cabin One. It's closer in case you\~\line want anything... right n to the\~\line office.\~\line \line CLOSEUP - NORMAN\~\line \line 
He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a\~\line remaining key on the board.\~\line \line TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN\~\line \line MARY\~\line I want sleep more than anything.\~\line Except maybe, food.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
There's a big diner about ten miles\~\line on up... just outside Fairvale.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Am I that close to Fairvale?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.\~\line \line He goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down
\~\line considerably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate\~\line some pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door,\~\line goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to\~\line her car, gets in, drives it to the parki
ng space in front of\~\line Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door\~\line of Cabin One.\~\line \line Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door,\~\line opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches\~
\line on a light. Mary goes o the cabin. Norman follows her.\~\line \line  CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Stuffy in here.\~\line (turns to her)\~\line 
Well... the mattress is soft and\~\line there're hangers in the closet and...\~\line stationary with "Bates' Motel" pred\~\line on it in case you want to make your\~\line friends back home envious... and...\~\line the... over there....\~\line 
(he pos to the\~\line bathroom, fairly\~\line blushes)\~\line \line MARY\~\line The bathroom.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (quickly, starting to\~\line leave)\~\line I'll be in the office if you want\~\line anything... just tap on the wall.\~\line \line 
MARY\~\line Thank you, Mr. Bates.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Norman Bates.\~\line \line He pauses at the door, gazes at her. She smiles.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line You have something most girls never\~\line have.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I have?\~\line 
\line NORMAN\~\line There's no name for it... But it's\~\line something that, that puts a person\~\line at ease.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Thank you. Again.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (not really a question)\~\line You're not going to go out again and\~
\line drive up to that diner, are you?\~\line \line MARY\~\line No.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Then will you do me a favor?\~\line (without waiting for\~\line her response)\~\line Will you have supper here? I was\~\line just about to, myself... nothing\~
\line more than some sandwiches and a lot\~\line of milk, but I'd like it if you'd\~\line come up to the house and... I don't\~\line set a fancy table but... the kitchen's\~\line awful homey.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'd like to.\~\line \line NORMAN\~
\line All right, you get your dresses\~\line hanging out and... change those wet\~\line shoes, and I'll come for you soon as\~\line it's ready...\~\line (starts out)\~\line ...with my trusty umbrella.\~\line (he laughs a small\~\line laugh, runs off)\~
\line \line Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to\~\line take out a dress. Her handbag is n to the suitcase. She\~\line glances down o it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches o\~\line 
the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at\~\line it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides\~\line to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks\~\line 
about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such\~\line places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her\~\line bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places\~\line the envelope within it, l
ock-folds the paper again and then\~\line places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later\~\line reading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes\~\line to her suitcase to start unpacking.\~\line \line 
Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of\~\line a woman's voice, raised in anger.\~\line \line WOMAN'S VOICE\~\line No! I tell you no!\~\line \line Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible\~\line 
voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA\~\line FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is\~\line still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming\~\line from that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.\~
\line \line WOMAN'S VOICE\~\line I won't have you bringing strange\~\line young girls in for supper...\~\line (an ugly, sneering\~\line note creeps o the\~\line voice)\~\line ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the\~\line cheap erotic fashion of young men\~
\line with cheap, erotic minds!\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line Mother, please...\~\line \line WOMAN'S VOICE\~\line And then what? After supper, music?\~\line Whispers?\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line Mother, she's just a stranger...\~\line 
hungry, and the weather's bad...\~\line \line WOMAN'S VOICE\~\line (mimicking cruelly)\~\line Mother, she's just a stranger!\~\line (hard, cruel again)\~\line As if men don't desire strangers, as\~\line if... oh, I refuse to speak of\~\line 
disgusting things because they disgust\~\line me! You understand, Boy?\~\line \line WOMAN'S VOICE\~\line (pause)\~\line Go on, go tell her she'll not be\~\line appeasing her ugly appetite with my\~\line food... or my son! Or do I have to\~\line 
tell her, cause you don't have the\~\line guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts,\~\line boy?\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line (blurted cut fury and\~\line shame)\~\line Shut up! Shut up!\~\line \line 
There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there.\~\line Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress\~\line and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes\~\line sadly at the little empty room.\~\line \line 
In a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door\~\line slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.\~\line \line FROM MARY'S VIEWPO - (NIGHT)\~\line \line We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered\~\line tray.\~\line 
\line  CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to\~\line the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.\~\line \line  THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)\~\line \line 
Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when\~\line Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch,\~\line past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He\~\line 
stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her\~\line eye.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I've caused you some trouble.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Mother...\~\line (a hollow little laugh,\~\line an attempt at sardonic\~\line humor)\~\line 
...what is the phrase... "she isn't\~\line herself today"... I think that's it.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (looking at the tray)\~\line You shouldn't have bothered. I really\~\line don't have that much of an appetite.\~\line \line 
Norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's\~\line reference to Mary's appetite.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I'm sorry. I wish... people could\~\line apologize for other people.\~\line \line MARY\~\line Don't worry about it.\~\line (a warm smile)
\~\line But as long as you've made us supper,\~\line we may as well eat it. Huh?\~\line \line She begins to back o her room. Norman starts to follow,\~\line hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young\~\line 
woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in\~\line defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his\~\line defiance for one day. He cannot go o Mary's room.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line It might be nicer... warmer in the\~\line 
office.\~\line \line Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries\~\line to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused\~\line sympathy, then follows.\~\line \line  THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line 
Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable\~\line place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing\~\line in the doorway.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Eating in an office...\~\line (a rueful smile)\~\line 
...to officious, even for me. I have\~\line the parlor behind this... if you'd\~\line like.\~\line \line Mary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and o the\~\line darkened parlor. Mary follows.\~\line \line  NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)\~\line \line 
In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office\~\line spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary\~\line comes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to\~\line lamp, turns on the light.\~\line \line Mary
 is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one\~\line lamp, the strange, raordinary nature of the room rushes\~\line up at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over\~\line the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to\~\line 
the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are\~\line of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary\~\line stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.\~\line \line CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN\~
\line \line NORMAN\~\line Please sit down. On the sofa.\~\line \line As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and\~\line pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies\~\line 
the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked\~\line with books on the subject of "Taxidermy."\~\line \line CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY\~\line \line She notices, too, the paings on the wall; nudes, primarily,\~
\line and many with a vaguely religious overtone.\~\line \line Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.\~\line \line MARY\~\line You're very... kind.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line It's all for you. I'm not hungry.\~\line 
Please go ahead.\~\line \line Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a\~\line small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in\~\line the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.\~\line \line 
Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles\~\line and then laughs.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line You eat like a bird.\~\line \line MARY\~\line You'd know, of course.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Not really. I hear that expression,\~\line 
that one eats "like a bird," is really\~\line a falsie, I mean a falsity, because\~\line birds eat a tremendous lot.\~\line (A pause, then\~\line explaining)\~\line Oh, I don't know anything about birds.\~\line My hobby is stuffing things...\~\line 
taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather\~\line stuff birds because... well, I hate\~\line the look of beasts when they're\~\line stuffed, foxes and chimps and all...\~\line some people even stuff dogs and\~\line cats... but I can't... I think only\~\line 
birds look well stuffed because\~\line they're rather... passive, to begin\~\line with... most of them...\~\line \line He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return\~\line of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him,\~\line w
ith some compression, smiles.\~\line \line MARY\~\line It's a strange hobby. Curious, I\~\line mean.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Uncommon, too.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I imagine so.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line It's not as expensive as you'd think.\~\line 
Cheap, really. Needles, thread,\~\line sawdust .. the chemicals are all\~\line that cost anything.\~\line (He goes quiet, looks\~\line disturbed)\~\line \line MARY\~\line A man should have a hobby.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
It's more than a hobby... sometimes...\~\line a hobby is supposed to pass the time,\~\line not fill it.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (after a pause, softly)\~\line Is your time so empty?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Oh, no!\~\line (forcing brightness\~\line 
again)\~\line I run the office, tend the cabins\~\line and grounds, do little chores for\~\line mother... the ones she allows I might\~\line be capable of doing.\~\line \line MARY\~\line You go out... with friends?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
Friends? Who needs friends.\~\line (Laughs, then with\~\line gallows humor)\~\line A boy's best friend is his mother.\~\line (Stops laughing)\~\line You've never had an empty moment in\~\line your whole life. Have you?\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
Only my share.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Where are you going? I don't mean to\~\line pry...\~\line \line MARY\~\line (A wistful smile)\~\line I'm looking for a private island.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line What are you running away from?\~\line \line MARY\~
\line (Alert)\~\line Why do you ask that?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No. People never run away from\~\line anything.\~\line (A pause)\~\line The rain didn't last very long.\~\line (Turning suddenly)\~\line You know what I think? I think we're\~\line 
all in our private traps, clamped in\~\line them, and none of us can ever climb\~\line out. We scratch and claw... but only\~\line at the air, only at each other, and\~\line for all of it, we never budge an\~\line inch.\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
Sometimes we deliberately step o\~\line those traps.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I was born in mine. I don't mind it\~\line anymore.\~\line \line MARY\~\line You should... mind it.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Oh I do... but I say I don't.\~\line 
(Laughs boyishly)\~\line \line MARY\~\line (Staring at him,\~\line shaking her head\~\line softly.)\~\line If anyone ever spoke to me, the way\~\line I heard... The way she spoke to you,\~\line I don't think I could ever laugh\~\line again.\~\line \line 
NORMAN\~\line (Controlled resentment)\~\line Sometimes when she talks that way to\~\line me I'd like to... curse her out and\~\line leave her forever!\~\line (A rueful smile)\~\line Or at least, defy her.\~\line (A pause, a hopeless\~\line shrug)\~\line 
But I couldn't. She's ill.\~\line \line MARY\~\line She sounded strong...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I mean... ill.\~\line (A pause)\~\line She had to raise me all by herself\~\line after my dad died... I was only\~\line five... and it must have been a\~
\line strain. Oh, she didn't have to go\~\line out to work or anything, Dad left us\~\line with a little something... anyway, a\~\line few years ago... Mother met a man.\~\line He talked her o building this\~\line motel... We could have talked her\~\line 
o anything... and when. Well...\~\line It was just too much for her when he\~\line died, too... And the way he died...\~\line Oh, it's nothing to talk about when\~\line you're eating.\~\line (Pauses, smiles)\~\line Anyway, it was too much of a loss\~
\line for my mother... she had nothing\~\line left.\~\line \line MARY\~\line (Critically)\~\line Except you.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line A son is a poor substitute for a\~\line lover.\~\line (Turns away as if in\~\line distaste of the word)\~\line \line 
MARY\~\line Why don't you go away?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line To a private island, like you?\~\line \line MARY\~\line No, not like me.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line It's too late for me. And besides...\~\line who'd look after her? She'd be alone\~\line 
up there, the fire would go out...\~\line damp and cold, like a grave. When\~\line you love someone, you don't do that\~\line to them, even if you hate them. Oh,\~\line I don't hate her. I hate... what\~\line she's become. I hate... the illness.\~\line 
\line MARY\~\line (Slowly, carefully)\~\line Wouldn't it be better if you put her\~\line in... someplace...\~\line \line She hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a\~\line striking coldness.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
An Institution? A madhouse? People\~\line always call a madhouse "someplace."\~\line (Mimicing coldly)\~\line Put her in Someplace!\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to\~\line sound uncaring...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
(The coldness turning\~\line to tight fury)\~\line What do you mean about caring? Have\~\line you ever seen one of those places?\~\line Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel\~\line eyes studying you... and my mother\~\line there? Why? has she harmed you?\~
\line She's as harmless as... one of these\~\line stuffed birds.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed\~\line she was harming you. I meant...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (High fury now)\~\line Well? You meant well? People always\~
\line mean well, they cluck their thick\~\line tongues and shake their heads and\~\line suggest so very delicately that...\~\line \line The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks\~\line back o his chair. There is a brief silence.\~
\line \line Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained\~\line by his anguish.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (Quietly)\~\line I've suggested it myself. But I hate\~\line to even think such a thing. She\~\line needs me... and it isn't...\~
\line (Looks up with a\~\line childlike pleading\~\line in his eyes)\~\line ...it isn't as if she were a maniac,\~\line a raving thing... it's just that...\~\line sometimes she goes a little mad. We\~\line all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't\~\line 
you?\~\line \line MARY\~\line (After a long\~\line thoughtful pause)\~\line Yes, and just one time can be enough.\~\line (Rises)\~\line Thank you.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (Cheerfully, correcting)\~\line Thank you, Norman.\~\line \line MARY\~\line 
Norman.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line You're not going to... to your room\~\line already?\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'm very tired. And I'll have a long\~\line drive tomorrow. All the way back to\~\line Phoenix.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Phoenix?\~\line 
\line MARY\~\line I stepped o a private trap back\~\line there -- and I want to go back and...\~\line try to pull myself out.\~\line (Looking close at\~\line Norman)\~\line Before it's too late for me, too.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (Looking at her)\~
\line Why don't you stay a little while,\~\line just for talking.\~\line \line MARY\~\line I'd like to, but...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Alright. I'll see you in the morning.\~\line I'll bring you breakfast. What time\~\line will you...\~\line \line MARY
\~\line Very early. Dawn.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Alright, Miss...\~\line (He has forgotten her\~\line name)\~\line \line MARY\~\line Crane.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line That's it.\~\line (He frowns, as if\~\line bothered by not being\~\line 
able to match the\~\line name to the memory\~\line of the name in the\~\line registration book)\~\line \line MARY\~\line Good night.\~\line \line She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's\~\line 
viewpo, as she crosses the small office, goes out o\~\line the night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see\~\line his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of\~\line determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts\~
\line to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of\~\line Mary's door in the cabin n door.\~\line \line He holds still, listens. He goes o the office and looks\~\line at the book.\~\line \line C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"\~\line \line 
M.S. - NORMAN\~\line \line He goes back o the parlor with a mystified expression.\~\line The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft\~\line SOUNDS, somehow imate in the night quiet. Norman turns\~\line 
his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting\~\line an impulse to listen, or more than listen.\~\line \line But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and,\~\line resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of\~
\line his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too\~\line had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a\~\line picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning\~\line against. Slowly he starts toward it.\~\line \line 
He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame\~\line off the wall.\~\line \line A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the\~\line hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is\~\line ve
ry dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light\~\line striking Norman's face.\~\line \line We move close to Norman, remely close, until his profile\~\line fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See\~\line 
the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps\~\line through.\~\line \line NORMAN'S VIEWPO\~\line \line Through the hole we look o Mary's cabin, see Mary\~\line undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over\~\line 
a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to\~\line unhook her bra.\~\line \line NORMAN - ECU\~\line \line He watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up\~\line and down the unseen figure of Mary.\~\line \line NORMAN'S VIEWPO\~
\line \line Mary, just slipping o a robe, covering her complete nudity.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line \line He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues\~\line turning until he can look out the small parlor window.\~\line \line 
We see, as he sees...\~\line \line THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line \line He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we\~\line see anger and anguish. And then resolve.\~\line \line 
Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in\~\line the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go\~\line through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering\~\line to close the door behind him.\~\line \line :\~\line 
\line  THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big\~\line house. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in\~\line the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his\~\line 
shoulders, strides manfully up the path.\~\line \line CAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house,\~\line enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look\~\line up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He\~\line 
holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage\~\line evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-\~\line passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen.\~\line At the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops\~
\line wearily o a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg\~\line and gently pushes the kitchen door closed.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a\~\line sma
ll notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which\~\line indicates her ention to make a restitution of the money\~\line she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her\~\line 
bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly\~\line beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after\~\line subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which\~\line matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.\~\line 
\line Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after\~\line subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not\~\line wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure\~\line that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to
\~\line continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the\~\line page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it o\~\line small pieces. She goes o the bathroom, drops the pieces\~\line 
o the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her\~\line robe and steps o the tub and turns the shower on.\~\line \line  MARY IN SHOWER\~\line \line Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see\~\line the bathroom doo
r, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch\~\line Mary as she washes and soaps herself.\~\line \line There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she\~\line looks somewhat relieved.\~\line \line 
Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.\~\line \line The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is\~\line then slowly and carefully closed.\~\line \line And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower\~\line 
curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white\~\line brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.\~\line \line Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain,\~\line rip it aside.\~\line \line :\~\line \line MARY - ECU\~\line 
\line As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower\~\line curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in\~\line her face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her\~\line 
throat. A hand comes o the shot. The hand holds an enormous\~\line bread knife. The fl of the blade shatters the screen to\~\line an almost total, silver blankness.\~\line \line THE SLASHING\~\line \line 
An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very\~\line screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of\~\line screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as\~\line Mary's body falls in the tub.\~\line \line REVERSE ANGLE\~
\line \line The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand\~\line pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a\~\line glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with\~\line 
madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a\~\line fright-wig. And then we see only the curtain, closed across\~\line the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the\~\line shower-bar we
 see the bathroom door open again and after a\~\line moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.\~\line \line :\~\line \line THE DEAD BODY\~\line \line Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over,\~\line 
touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if\~\line popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.\~\line Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along\~\line the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA
\~\line FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the\~\line bathroom, past the toilet, out o the bedroom. As CAMERA\~\line approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed\~\line it on the bedside table.\~\line \line 
CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER\~\line \line beside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window\~\line and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR,\~\line coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful,\~\line shocked voice.\~
\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line Mother! Oh God, what... blood,\~\line blood... mother...!\~\line \line We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.\~\line \line After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the\~\line 
front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.\~\line \line QUICK :\~\line \line  THE PATH - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes o\~\line an reme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in\~\line 
his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman\~\line runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's\~\line room.\~\line \line  MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the\~
\line room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open.\~\line He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.\~\line \line Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face,\~\line 
covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the\~\line window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we\~\line see the bedside table with the newspaper on it.\~\line \line After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the
\~\line edge of the bed.\~\line \line FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN\~\line \line Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can\~\line see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile\~\line floor. Norman presses hi
s eyes, fights to find a way out of\~\line his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the\~\line peace that comes with decision.\~\line \line Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with\~\line 
resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across\~\line it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch,\~\line and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the\~\line bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from
\~\line the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.\~\line \line  THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully\~\line behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We\~\line 
stay outside. Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and\~\line then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the\~\line office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door\~\line 
opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman\~\line comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about,\~\line goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes o\~\line Mary's cabin, closing the door after him.\~\line \line 
 MARY'S CABIN\~\line \line With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see\~\line him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then\~\line gathers his strength and goes o the bathroom. We HEAR him\~\line 
set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower\~\line being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES\~\line FORWARD so that we can see o bathroom.\~\line \line CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up.\~\line 
Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges\~\line with it o the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him\~\line spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside\~\line the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of
\~\line it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over\~\line and onto the tile floor. Again he goes o the bathroom and\~\line CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman.\~\line 
He works carefully, with his arms ended away from his\~\line body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it\~\line across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain\~\line in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up,
\~\line examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to\~\line the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.\~\line \line CLOSE SHOT\~\line \line We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being\~\line diluted and was
hed away by the gush of the faucet water.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line \line We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn\~\line to the job of cleaning the bathroom.\~\line \line He places the pail in the tub, runs water o it, dips the\~\line 
mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the\~\line wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and\~\line even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel\~\line and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.\~
\line Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail,\~\line cleans out the tub, and goes out o the bedroom.\~\line \line  MARY'S BEDROOM\~\line \line Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to\~\line 
the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of\~\line her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk,\~\line where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up\~\line the keys, crosses the room, goes out.\~\line \line 
 THE PORCH\~\line \line We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then\~\line hurry across the porch and o Mary's car. He circle-turns\~\line the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch,\~\line 
directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.\~\line \line Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key\~\line and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back o the cabin.\~\line \line  MARY'S ROOM\~\line \line 
From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to\~\line wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of\~\line the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he\~\line 
picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his\~\line foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind\~\line him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body\~\line 
in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it.\~\line He comes back o the cabin, closes the door completely,\~\line flicks on the light.\~\line \line Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he\~\line 
pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he\~\line is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues\~\line with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to\~\line gather up all Mary's articles and toss them o the suitcase.
\~\line He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks\~\line under bed and bureau, goes o the bathroom, checks that\~\line room again, comes back o the bedroom, looks about\~\line carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that o the\~
\line suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl\~\line are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks\~\line it up.\~\line \line With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the\~\line 
mop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches\~\line off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts\~\line out.\~\line \line  THE PORCH\~\line \line As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly\~\line 
lit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of\~\line the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a\~\line flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman\~\line 
to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the\~\line car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and\~\line the pail o it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then\~\line realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin.\~
\line He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the\~\line newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the\~\line newspaper, and looks once again o the bathroom. His glance\~\line goes right over the toilet bowl.\~\line \line 
He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes\~\line out onto the porch.\~\line \line He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it.\~\line He goes around and jumps o the car and starts away.\~\line \line 
We HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)\~\line \line The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as\~\line CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.\~\line \line 
It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects.\~\line Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns\~\line off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the\~\line 
swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car,\~\line realizes he has no choice. He leans o the car, releases\~\line the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car\~\line begins to roll o the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW,\~
\line THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.\~\line \line The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane\~\line flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps\~\line 
away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the\~\line plane overhead grows louder.\~\line \line Norman looks up.\~\line \line NORMAN'S VIEWPO - THE BLACK SKY\~\line \line We see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to\~\line diminish.
\~\line \line CUT BACK TO:\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line \line We see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.\~\line \line More than two-thirds of it have already sunk o the swamp.\~\line The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime,\~
\line as if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to\~\line panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And\~\line slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear\~\line 
only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only\~\line the small after-bubble, like a visual burp.\~\line \line Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire\~\line marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.\~\line 
\line He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line CLOSE UP NORMAN\~\line \line standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post.\~\line He is staring out o the night, a look of guarded, casual\~
\line innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment\~\line of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down\~\line and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground\~\line 
outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the\~\line tire marks.\~\line \line After a moment, Norman's hand comes o shot, picks up hose,\~\line places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see\~\line 
that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the\~\line road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a\~\line car had been parked here.\~\line \line After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it\~\line 
off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away\~\line from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that\~\line leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps\~\line 
of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up\~\line the steps and o the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES\~\line as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the\~\line stairs.\~\line \line 
On the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is\~\line closed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained\~\line dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an REMELY\~\line HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up
\~\line the stained dress and shoes.\~\line \line He rolls the shoes o the dress, tucks the small, neat\~\line bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading\~\line for the basement.\~\line \line  A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)\~\line 
\line It stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait.\~\line Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.\~\line \line FADE OUT:\~\line \line FADE IN\~\line \line  BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence\~\line \line begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can\~\line read as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead\~\line 
reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest\~\line right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room\~\line which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks\~\line 
big enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped\~\line and miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come\~\line to your senses, and still want to...\~\line \line CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper\~\line 
over, continues backing away out of the small back room and\~\line heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk,\~\line BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter,\~\line 
a look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a\~\line meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and\~\line examining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:\~\line \line WOMAN CUSTOMER\~\line 
...They tell you what its ingredients\~\line are and how it's guaranteed to\~\line erminate any insect in the world,\~\line but they do not tell you whether or\~\line not it's painless. And I say insect\~\line or man, death should always be\~\line 
painless.\~\line \line CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware\~\line store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door.\~\line She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a\~\line 
look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small\~\line overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.\~\line \line Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her,\~\line gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.\~\line \line 
Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her\~\line eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam?\~\line \line SUMMERFIELD\~\line You want to see Sam?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam Loomis.\~\line \line 
SUMMERFIELD\~\line (yelling toward back\~\line room)\~\line Sam! Lady wants to see you!\~\line \line Lila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on\~\line worriedly examining the fine pr of the insecticide can.\~\line 
Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a\~\line moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he\~\line does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried\~\line expression.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Yes?\~\line \line 
LILA\~\line May I talk to you?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (a bit mystified)\~\line Sure...\~\line \line Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts\~\line toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then\~\line 
follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him\~\line ently as she says:\~\line \line LILA\~\line I'm Mary's sister.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Lila.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (quickly)\~\line Is Mary here?\~\line \line 
Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile\~\line expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment.\~\line Behind them is a display of various size carving knives.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Is something wrong?\~\line \line LILA
\~\line I want to know if my sister is here.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Here?\~\line \line LILA\~\line With you.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Where?\~\line \line LILA\~\line I don't know where. In your store,\~\line somewhere in your town... anywhere.\~\line 
\line SAM\~\line What's the matter?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Don't you know?\~\line \line As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing\~\line past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.\~\line \line WOMAN CUSTOMER\~\line 
All I can do is hope if it isn't\~\line painless, it's quick!\~\line \line She speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods\~\line happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring\~\line apprehensively at Lila.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
What should I know?\~\line \line LILA\~\line To begin with, where Mary is. Do\~\line you?\~\line \line SAM\~\line No. I take it you don't either?\~\line (As Lila shakes her\~\line head)\~\line How long?\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
Last Friday. She left work, and\~\line home... I was in Tucson over the\~\line weekend... I haven't heard from her,\~\line not even a phone call.\~\line \line SAM\~\line And you thought she'd come up here,\~\line to me? If she had, what reason would\~
\line she have for not calling you?\~\line \line LILA\~\line A good reason, I suppose.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Slightly exasperated)\~\line Well what do you think, we eloped or\~\line something? Or we're living in sin\~\line and...\~\line \line LILA\~
\line Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being\~\line defensive that you haven't even\~\line reacted to the most serious fact of\~\line all. Mary is missing.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I was getting to that!\~\line \line LILA\~\line What do you know about it?\~
\line \line SAM\~\line Nothing! You're putting me on the\~\line defensive.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Look, if you two are in this thing\~\line together, I don't care, it's none of\~\line my business... But I want to see\~\line 
Mary. I want her to tell me she's\~\line all right and it's none of my\~\line business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix\~\line and...\~\line \line She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes\~\line beginning t
o fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a\~\line moment, then turns and calls:\~\line \line SAM\~\line Bob? Run out and get yourself some\~\line lunch.\~\line \line SUMMERFIELD\~\line It's okay, Sam, I brought it with\~\line me.\~\line \line SAM\~
\line Run out and eat it.\~\line \line Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way.\~\line \line Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.\~\line \line SAM\~\line What thing?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Huh?\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
What thing could we be in together?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (A pause)\~\line I hate tears.\~\line (Takes out hankie)\~\line \line SAM\~\line Is Mary... in trouble?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Well why didn't she come to me...\~
\line call me...?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Not that kind...\~\line (Almost a smile)\~\line You men and your egos.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Seriously)\~\line Never mind my ego. Let's talk about\~\line Mary.\~\line \line 
Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled\~\line quietly o the room. He ignores them, walks past them,\~\line goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "CLOSED\~\line FOR LUNCH," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the\~
\line sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam\~\line and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly\~\line smile.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Let's all talk about Mary.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Who are you, friend?\~\line 
\line ARBOGAST\~\line Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.\~\line (To Lila)\~\line Where is she, Miss Crane?\~\line \line LILA\~\line I don't know.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Wouldn't have been able to tail you\~\line if you did.\~\line \line SAM\~
\line What's your erest?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Money.\~\line \line There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the\~\line sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Somebody better tell me what's going\~\line 
on and tell me fast! I can take so\~\line much and then...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line (errupting calmly)\~\line Your girl friend stole forty thousand\~\line dollars.\~\line \line Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks\~\line 
one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Why?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line (An almost amused\~\line smile)\~\line Must've needed it.\~\line \line SAM\~\line What are you talking about?\~\line (To Lila)\~\line What is this?\~
\line \line LILA\~\line She was supposed to bank it, on\~\line Friday, for her boss. She didn't.\~\line \line And no one has seen her since.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line (Looking at Sam)\~\line Someone has seen her. Someone always\~\line 
sees a girl with forty thousand\~\line dollars.\~\line (To Sam)\~\line She is your girl friend, isn't she?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam, they don't want to prosecute,\~\line they just want the money back. It\~\line was all in cash...\~\line \line ARBOGAST
\~\line (Correcting with\~\line Cassidy's word)\~\line Casharoonie!\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam, if she's here...\~\line \line SAM\~\line She isn't!\~\line \line A real look of anguish comes o Lila's face. And Arbogast\~\line studies it, then speaks.\~
\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line You came up here on a hunch, Miss\~\line Crane? Nothing more? No phone call...\~\line from him, or from your sister herself?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (wearily)\~\line Not even a hunch. Just hope.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line 
With a little checking, I could get\~\line to believe you.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (anxiously)\~\line I don't care if you do or... I want\~\line to see Mary... before she gets in\~\line any deeper...\~\line \line SAM\~\line Did you check in Phoenix...\~
\line hospitals... maybe she had an\~\line accident... a hold-up...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line She was seen leaving town in her\~\line car. Seen by her very victims, I\~\line might add.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (after a moment)\~\line I don't believe it.
\~\line (to Lila, slowly)\~\line Do you?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (a thoughtful pause)\~\line Yes... I just... did. The moment\~\line they told me...\~\line \line SAM\~\line You might have doubted for say five\~\line minutes or so, Sister.\~\line \line 
Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face.\~\line Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line We're always quickest to doubt people\~\line who have a record for being honest.\~\line 
I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where\~\line there's a boyfriend...\~\line (Trails off, smiles\~\line encouragingly)\~\line She won't be back there among the\~\line nuts and bolts... but she'll be in\~\line this town... somewhere. I'll find\~\line her.\~
\line \line He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to\~\line the counter, opens door, goes out o the street.\~\line \line After a quiet moment:\~\line \line LILA\~\line I just listened... and believed\~\line 
everything they told me. 'She stole\~\line the money.' 'We don't want to get\~\line her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the\~\line police in'...\~\line \line SAM\~\line It was her boss' idea not to report\~\line it to the police?\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
No. The man whose money she... he\~\line talked so loud and fast, and I... I\~\line should've called the police.\~\line \line SAM\~\line He must have had a darn good reason\~\line for wanting them kept out of it...\~\line All that cash...\~\line \line 
LILA\~\line I ought to call the police right\~\line now!\~\line \line SAM\~\line No.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Why not? Sam, is she hiding here?\~\line Are you two planning to go away with\~\line the money?\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
How could I go away? I'm in debt up\~\line to my...\~\line (Smiles at the\~\line incongruity of his\~\line reply, then goes\~\line serious)\~\line If she did steal that money... It's\~\line hard to believe she did because it's\~\line 
hard to see why she would. Unless\~\line she had some wild idea that it would\~\line help me... us...\~\line \line LILA\~\line She haven't even called you?\~\line \line SAM\~\line I didn't see her... and I didn't\~\line hear from her! Believe that!\~
\line \line LILA\~\line I need to... I need to believe\~\line something. This is the first time\~\line I've ever come up against anything I\~\line couldn't... understand.\~\line \line SAM\~\line You've led a charmed life.\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
No. I just think... anything can be\~\line explained. But Mary, doing a thing\~\line like this... I don't know how to\~\line handle...\~\line \line SAM\~\line Maybe we can handle it together.\~\line (He smiles\~\line encouragingly)\~\line \line LILA\~
\line (A rueful shrug)\~\line I came flying up here expecting to\~\line get some explanation... for all I\~\line know, she may be trying to get in\~\line touch with me, at home. I'd better\~\line go home.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (A thoughtful pause)\~
\line I think she'll contact me if she\~\line contacts anybody. Why don't you stay\~\line here. When she shows up... or calls...\~\line be here.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (A long study, her\~\line suspicion of him\~\line evaporating)\~\line 
You want me to stay here?\~\line \line SAM\~\line She'll need both of us.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (considers, then:)\~\line Where... can I stay?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (brightly)\~\line First rate hotel, fifty yards up the\~\line street. Come on.\~
\line (as he reaches for\~\line the closed-for-lunch\~\line sign)\~\line After we check you in we'll go to\~\line the drugstore and get you a sandwich.\~\line Then we'll come back here... and\~\line wait.\~\line \line 
He hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door\~\line behind him.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  STREET - (DAY)\~\line \line They emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel. As\~\line 
they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white\~\line Ford sedan from a rental car man. They glance at him and he\~\line returns a cynical look.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  HOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Outside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white\~\line car and go o new hotel.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  COUNTRYSIDE - (DAY)\~\line \line The white car speeding along the highway.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line 
 NEW MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line Arbogast going o the office - we see the sign above him.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line A high shot showing the freeway and Bates house and motel on\~\line 
the side old highway. A pause and then across the bottom of\~\line the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  HOTEL - (DUSK)\~\line \line Another Hotel. Arbogast goes in.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line 
\line  BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line The white car speeding along the freeway again going in the\~\line opposite direction to last time. Norman, a tiny figure, is\~\line seen going up the steps to his mother's house.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line 
\line  BOARDING HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line Arbogast's search is getting down in the scale. This is an\~\line entrance to a cheesy boarding house. "Rooms to Rent," etc.\~\line He looks at his list and then goes in.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line 
 BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line The white car goes by on the freeway again.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  ROOMING HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line Arbogast goes in.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  BATES' MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)\~\line \line 
Heavy traffic on the freeway. A beat or two - again the white\~\line car. It slows up opposite the distant motel. It makes a turn\~\line and goes back out of scene. A pause and it reappears on the\~\line 
old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates' Motel.\~\line \line  THE BATES' HOUSE AND MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)\~\line \line We now see Norman. He has brought out an old rocking chair\~\line and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched\~
\line in it. And he is darning one of his own socks. CAMERA HOLDS.\~\line Beyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can\~\line barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his\~\line 
mother seated at the window. Here, too, there is that quality\~\line of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding.\~\line \line Now Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car.\~\line \line 
And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast\~\line gets out. Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes\~\line at Norman, starts forward. In his steps and manner there is\~\line 
that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too\~\line many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers\~\line over too short a period of time.\~\line \line Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
(shoving sock in his\~\line pocket)\~\line I always forget to put the sign on,\~\line but we do have vacancy.\~\line (Cheerfully)\~\line Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve\~\line vacancies.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line (pleasantly)\~\line 
In the past two days I've been to so\~\line many motels, my eyes are bleary with\~\line neon. This is the first one that\~\line looked like it was hiding from the\~\line world at large.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I don't really forget the sign, it\~\line 
just doesn't seem... any use.\~\line (Pos)\~\line This used to be the main highway.\~\line (Starts for office)\~\line Want to register, please?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Sit down. I don't want to trouble\~\line you, just want to ask...\~\line \line 
NORMAN\~\line No trouble. Today's linen day. I\~\line change all the beds once a week,\~\line whether they've been used or not...\~\line dampness. I hate the smell of\~\line dampness.\~\line (Opening office door)\~\line It's such a dank smell.\~\line 
\line Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in.\~\line \line Norman follows.\~\line \line  MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT)\~\line \line Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen\~\line 
closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has\~\line remained standing by the door.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line You out to buy a motel?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line No.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Oh. I thought... you said you'd been\~\line 
to so many in two days... What was\~\line it you wanted to ask?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line I'm looking for a missing person.\~\line (takes out and opens\~\line wallet and ends\~\line it as he speaks)\~\line My name's Arbogast, private\~\line 
investigator...\~\line (takes back wallet\~\line when Norman doesn't\~\line look at it)\~\line Trying to trace a young girl who's\~\line been missing almost a week. From\~\line Phoenix.\~\line (A look at Norman's\~\line frightened expression)\~\line 
It's a private matter... family wants\~\line to forgive her...\~\line (smiles)\~\line She isn't in trouble.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (forcing a smile)\~\line I didn't think the police went\~\line searching for people who weren't in\~\line trouble.\~
\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line I'm not the police.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Oh.\~\line \line He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out\~\line sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.\~\line \line 
Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he\~\line crosses to Norman.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line We have reason to believe she came\~\line this way... might have stopped in\~\line this area...\~\line (ends photograph,\~\line which Nor
man doesn't\~\line glance at)\~\line Did she stop here?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No. No one has stopped here in\~\line weeks...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Mind looking at the picture before\~\line committing yourself?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
Committing myself to what? You sure\~\line talk like a Policeman.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Look at the picture. Please.\~\line \line Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow\~\line 
cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No. At least I don't recall.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line She might have used an alias. Mary\~\line Crane's the real name, but she\~\line might've registered...\~\line 
\line NORMAN\~\line (errupting)\~\line I don't even bother with guests\~\line registering any more... I mean, little\~\line by little, you drop the formalities.\~\line (more relaxed, because\~\line Arbogast is listening\~\line with a pleasant smile)\~
\line I shouldn't even bother to change\~\line the linen. I guess habits die hard.\~\line Which reminds me...\~\line \line He goes to the wall, flips a light switch.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line The vacancy sign. Just in case.\~\line \line 
We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't\~\line been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining\~\line town or something.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Now there's a couple even remarking\~\line 
about your sign, and see how easily\~\line you forgot them?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line What?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line You thought no one has stopped here\~\line in weeks. Now, try to remember if\~\line this girl...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line 
(A pause, a study)\~\line Maybe she even signed the register...\~\line because habits die hard. Let's check\~\line it, huh?\~\line \line Norman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the\~\line registry book around, flips back a page or two.\~
\line \line Norman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faly,\~\line pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Yes sir! Marie Samuels. eresting\~\line alias.\~\line \line 
He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside\~\line the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding\~\line and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as\~\line happy as it is making him.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line 
Don't know where she got "Marie,"\~\line but "Samuels" figures. Her boy\~\line friend's name is Sam.\~\line (Turns to Norman, the\~\line smile gone)\~\line Was she in disguise? Or do you want\~\line to check the picture again?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
I didn't lie to you. I just have\~\line trouble keeping track of... time.\~\line \line Arbogast has reached him, the picture ended. Norman looks\~\line dutifully at it.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line It was raining and her hair didn't\~\line 
look like that... damped out, I guess.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Tell me all about her.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line She arrived kind of late, wet and\~\line hungry and she was very tired and\~\line went right to bed and left early.\~\line \line ARBOGAST
\~\line How early?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Very early. Dawn.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Of which morning?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line The following morning. Sunday.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line No one met her?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No.\~\line 
\line ARBOGAST\~\line Or arrived with her.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line She didn't call anyone? Even locally?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line You didn't spend the whole night\~\line 
with her did you?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No! Of all...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line How do you know she didn't make a\~\line call?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line She was tired. She said she had a\~\line long drive ahead of her, in the\~\line 
morning... Yes, now I'm remembering\~\line very clearly because I'm picturing.\~\line When you make a picture of the moment\~\line in your mind, you can remember every\~\line detail. She was sitting back there,\~\line no she was standing up, with some\~
\line sandwich still in her hand, and she\~\line said she had to drive a long way.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Back where?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line What do you mean?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line You said she was sitting "back there,"\~\line 
or standing rather...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Oh. My private parlor. She had an\~\line awful hunger... so I made her some\~\line supper. And then she went to bed and\~\line left in the morning. I didn't even\~\line see her leave.\~\line \line ARBOGAST
\~\line How did she pay you?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line What?\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Cash or check? For the cabin...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Cash.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line And when she left, she never came\~\line back.\~\line \line NORMAN\~
\line Why should she? I'm sorry, I have\~\line work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't\~\line aspic!\~\line (smiles)\~\line This ain't jelling.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
I don't know what you expect me to\~\line know about... people come and go...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line She isn't still here, is she?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Not at all!\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Suppose I wanted to search the cabins,\~\line 
all twelve... would I need a warrant?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (as if pleasantly\~\line exasperated)\~\line Look, if you won't believe me, go\~\line ahead. You can help me make beds if\~\line you like.\~\line (laughs, shakes his\~\line head)\~\line 
Come on.\~\line \line He starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the\~\line young man's openness.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One,\~\line 
walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if\~\line Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch,\~\line but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of\~\line 
the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old\~\line house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the\~\line Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Change your mind?\~\line \line 
Arbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts\~\line to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I guess I've got one of those faces\~\line you can't help believing.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line 
(to Norman, but\~\line continuing to stare\~\line at the house)\~\line Anyone at home?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I live there. Alone.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Someone is sitting in that window.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line My mother.\~\line \line 
Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line She's... ill. Confined to her room.\~\line It's practically living alone.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line (after a pause)\~\line If this girl Mary Crane were here,\~\line 
you'd have no reason to hide her\~\line would you?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Of course not.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line If she paid you well?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Now, look...!\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Or if she had you say... gallantly\~
\line protecting her... you wouldn't be\~\line fooled... you'd know she was just\~\line using you. Wouldn't you?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable\~\line of being fooled! Not even by women!\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line 
I didn't mean that as a slur on your\~\line manhood. I'm sorry.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (disturbed now)\~\line That's all right. maybe she could\~\line have fooled me. But...\~\line (a rueful smile)\~\line She didn't fool my mother.\~\line \line 
ARBOGAST\~\line Your mother met her?\~\line (quickly)\~\line Can I talk to your mother?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No. I told you, she's confined...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Just for a moment. She might have\~\line picked up a h you'd miss.\~\line 
\line ARBOGAST\~\line Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I\~\line won't disturb...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line No! Just no! I have one of those\~\line breaking pos like any other man,\~\line believe it or not, and I'm near it.\~\line 
There's just so much pushing I can\~\line take and I think...\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line All right!\~\line (starts away, toward\~\line his car, pauses)\~\line Might save me a lot of leg-work if I\~\line could just talk to your mother. But\~\line 
I'd need a warrant for that, won't\~\line I?\~\line \line Norman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts\~\line the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own\~\line face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around\~\line 
very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the\~\line lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his\~\line headlights light up the porch.\~\line \line Norman stands, watching him drive away.\~\line \line  PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)\~
\line \line The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor\~\line running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA\~\line PULLS AWAY and we\~\line \line :\~\line \line  HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Arbogast get
s to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS\~\line FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from\~\line his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and\~\line dial this number. As we reach phone booth,\~\line \line :\~\line \line 
ARBOGAST\~\line (o phone)\~\line Miss Crane, please.\~\line (listens)\~\line She leave a number?\~\line (listens)\~\line Thanks.\~\line (hangs up, dials again,\~\line waits)\~\line Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast.\~\line (waits)\~\line 
Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it\~\line might make you feel a little better.\~\line Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday\~\line night at Bates' Motel, out here on\~\line the old highway.\~\line (listens)\~\line Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent\~
\line the night, left, period!\~\line (listens)\~\line I did question him, believe me. I\~\line think I got all there was to get.\~\line Just have to try to pick up the scent\~\line from here.\~\line (listens)\~\line Well... maybe that's because I don't\~
\line feel entirely satisfied. He's got a\~\line sick old mother, confined type, and\~\line I think she saw Mary and talked to\~\line her. Shame, too... confined old women\~\line love to talk to strangers.\~\line (listens)\~\line 
I was, but I think I'll go back to\~\line the motel, first.\~\line (listens)\~\line No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis.\~\line I should be back in an hour.\~\line (listens)\~\line All right. And Lila... You'll be\~\line 
happy to know what I think. I think\~\line our friend Sam Loomis didn't even\~\line know Mary was here.\~\line (smiles)\~\line See you in an hour. Or less.\~\line \line He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line 
 BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\~\line \line A distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on\~\line in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office.\~\line We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch\~\line 
toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He\~\line goes o the last cabin and switches the light on. o the\~\line foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and\~\line stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office.
\~\line \line  MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Arbogast goes in.\~\line \line  OFFICE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls.\~\line \line ARBOGAST\~\line Bates!\~\line \line 
He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks\~\line around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees:\~\line \line C.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER\~\line \line C.U. - ARBOGAST\~\line \line 
goes over to it. He finds it unlocked. With a quick, cautious\~\line look around he opens it.\~\line \line C.U. - THE EMPTY SAFE\~\line \line C.U. - ARBOGAST\~\line \line straightens up and goes out.\~\line \line  MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line 
Arbogast comes out and looks off. He sees:\~\line \line THE LAST LIT CABIN\~\line \line The door ajar.\~\line \line C.U. - ARBOGAST - (NIGHT)\~\line \line would go along but he stops with a new thought. He turns\~\line around and looks off.\~\line \line 
L.S. - THE OLD HOUSE FROM HIS VIEWPO - (NIGHT)\~\line \line C.U. - ARBOGAST\~\line \line comes to a decision. He goes off.\~\line \line L.S. ARBOGAST\~\line \line dashes up the stone steps to the House.\~\line \line MEDIUM SHOT\~\line \line 
CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house\~\line is dark within except, as we can now see, for a fa spill\~\line of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs\~\line hall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in,\~
\line sees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for\~\line along moment, hears nothing.\~\line \line Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door\~\line and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins\~\line 
to open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip\~\line through and o the foyer.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it,\~\line waiting.
 He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no\~\line one. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast\~\line listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds\~\line coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the\~
\line sounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait,\~\line he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly,\~\line placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks\~\line 
or groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA\~\line FOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the\~\line stairway as Arbogast makes his way up.\~\line \line :\~\line \line REMELY HIGH ANGLE\~\line \line 
 STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING\~\line \line We see Arbogast coming up the stairs. And now we see, too,\~\line the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly.\~\line \line As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother\~\line 
steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous\~\line knife flashing.\~\line \line C.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST\~\line \line The knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts.\~\line The sudden attack throws hi
m off balance. He stumbles back\~\line and staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically\~\line gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the\~\line stairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife\~\line 
keeps thrusting itself o the foreground. As he collapses\~\line at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates\~\line plunges o the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain\~\line the raising and descending murder weapon.\~\line \line 
FADE OUT\~\line \line FADE IN\~\line \line  BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't\~\line moved from it in the last hour. Sam is pacing, occasionally\~\line 
stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. The ash\~\line tray close to Lila is filled.\~\line \line There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness\~\line in the small, otherwise cozy room.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
(at window, quietly)\~\line Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely\~\line sound. Ever notice, Lila?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (unable to keep up\~\line small talk)\~\line Sam. He said an hour. Or less.\~\line \line SAM\~\line It's been three.\~\line \line 
LILA\~\line Are we just going to go on sitting\~\line here?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (suddenly cheerful)\~\line He'll be back. Let's sit still and\~\line hang on, okay?\~\line \line LILA\~\line You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Whenever I start contemplating the\~\line panic button, your back straightens\~\line up and your eyes get that God-looks-\~\line out-for-everybody look and... I feel\~\line better.\~\line \line SAM
\~\line I feel better when you feel better.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (a pause - then she\~\line rises)\~\line Where's the old highway?\~\line \line SAM\~\line You want to run out there, bust in\~\line on Arbogast and the sick old lady,\~\line 
shake her up and maybe spoil\~\line everything Arbogast's been building\~\line for the last three hours.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SAM\~\line That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
Patience doesn't run in our family.\~\line Sam, I'm going out there!\~\line \line SAM\~\line Arbogast said...\~\line \line LILA\~\line An hour! Or less!\~\line \line Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real\~\line 
anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (o phone)\~\line Got the number of the motel out on\~\line the old highway? Bates, I think.\~\line (waits)\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam! Why call when we can go?\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?\~\line (o phone)\~\line Thanks.\~\line \line He presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates'\~\line \line Motel. The fa other-end ringing tones can be heard,\~\line repeatedly, annoyingly. He waits.\~\line 
\line SAM\~\line (to Lila)\~\line Probably on his way back right now.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam, I'm going.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (hangs up and picks\~\line up his jacket)\~\line You'll never find it.\~\line \line 
He starts for the door. Lila follows after him o the store.\~\line \line  STORE\~\line \line He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Stay here.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Why can't I go out there with you?\~\line 
\line SAM\~\line (looks at her)\~\line I don't know...\~\line (he collects himself)\~\line One of us has to be here in case\~\line Arbogast's on the way.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (nervously)\~\line Just wait here?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (a warm smile)\~
\line Contemplate your... panic button.\~\line \line He hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on\~\line Lila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the\~\line darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister\~\line 
shapes.\~\line \line C.U.\~\line \line Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls\~\line onto the floor.\~\line \line MEDIUM SHOT\~\line \line Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in\~\line 
its place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street\~\line with a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious\~\line shiver.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)\~\line \line 
Tall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of\~\line Norman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at\~\line the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet\~\line face of it.\~\line \line :\~\line \line 
 THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line All light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's\~\line room. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window,\~\line relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned o the room.\~\line 
After a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's\~\line small pick-up truck swings o the driveway.\~\line \line Sam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights,\~\line pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area.\~
\line Then he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office,\~\line knocks on the door. As he waits for a response, he looks\~\line down the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks\~\line again, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the
\~\line house and the figure at the one lit window. He stares a moment\~\line then calls loudly:\~\line \line SAM\~\line Arbogast?\~\line \line :\~\line \line  THE SWAMP\~\line \line The silhouette of Norman. He is still. Over shot, very dimly,\~\line 
comes the SOUND OF SAM'S VOICE, calling again for Arbogast.\~\line \line Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile,\~\line his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in\~\line the direction of the h
ouse. There is silence for a moment,\~\line and then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room\~\line spilling in.
\~\line \line L.S.\~\line \line With CAMERA placed with its back to the street door, we can\~\line see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in\~\line the back room beyond. There is a SOUND of a car pulling up.\~\line 
The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back\~\line room down the aisle of hardware and comes o a BIG HEAD.\~\line We see Lila's desperate anxious look.\~\line \line MEDIUM SHOT\~\line \line 
From her viewpo we see Sam alighting from his truck and\~\line coming toward the door of the store. He enters. He and Lila\~\line exchange quiet glances.\~\line \line SAM\~\line He didn't come back here?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (worriedly)\~\line Sam.\~
\line \line SAM\~\line No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the\~\line old lady at home...\~\line (frowning)\~\line A sick old lady unable to answer the\~\line door... or unwilling.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Where could he have gone?\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
Maybe he got some definite lead.\~\line Maybe he went right on...\~\line \line LILA\~\line Without calling me?\~\line \line SAM\~\line In a hurry.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam, he called me when he had nothing\~\line definite, nothing but a dissatisfied\~
\line feeling. Don't you think he'd have\~\line called if he had anything...\~\line \line SAM\~\line (errupting)\~\line Yes. I think he would have.\~\line \line Lila goes quiet. Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at\~\line 
the doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking\~\line out at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a\~\line moment they share at each other across the darkened room.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Let's go see Al Chambers.\~\line \line LILA
\~\line Who's he?\~\line \line SAM\~\line He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.\~\line \line As he starts forward.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)\~\line \line 
A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses\~\line dim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the\~\line street, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA\~\line 
MOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the\~\line truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Our Deputy sleeps.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Well?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Nothing. Just... all the lights\~
\line out... must be asleep.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (a small exasperation)\~\line Does that mean we can't...\~\line \line SAM\~\line No. I'm just procrastinating. People\~\line hate when the doorbell rings in the\~\line middle of the night.\~\line 
(gives up, starts out)\~\line Come on.\~\line \line He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already\~\line out. CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door.\~\line Sam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost\~\line 
knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST\~\line OF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like\~\line a fire alarm than a doorbell.\~\line \line He tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The\~\line 
downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is\~\line unhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick\~\line of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of\~\line hospitality.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Oh?\~
\line \line SAM\~\line Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering\~\line you...\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line You didn't!\~\line (a cross look up at\~\line the bell)\~\line It's tinkerbell.\~\line (a quick smile at\~\line Lila)\~\line 
Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if\~\line anyone rings it in the middle of the\~\line night.\~\line (to Sam)\~\line Well come on in, at least!\~\line \line As she opens the door wide,\~\line \line :\~\line \line 
 DOWNSTAIRS HALL OF SHERIFF'S HOUSE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Fat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted.\~\line The lighting is bright.\~\line \line There is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch.\~\line 
Mrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Albert!\~\line (a tiny wait, a smile\~\line as Sam and Lila enter)\~\line Al Chambers!\~\line \line Sam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers\~\line mo
tions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans\~\line outside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is\~\line even more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the\~\line stairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER\~
\line SHOT.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Customers!\~\line \line SHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which\~\line matches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face\~\line 
originally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks\~\line at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern.\~\line \line SAM\~\line We have a problem.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line (to Lila)\~\line Let's go out back and have some coca
\~\line while the men are talking.\~\line \line LILA\~\line No, thank you. It's my problem, too.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I don't know where to start...\~\line (a look at Lila)\~\line Except at the beginning.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SAM
\~\line (to Sheriff)\~\line This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.\~\line She's been here for a few days,\~\line looking for her sister. There's a\~\line private detective helping... and,\~\line well, we got a call tonight, from\~\line 
this detective, saying he'd traced\~\line Mary...\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Mary is Lila's sister?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Yes. He traced her to that motel,\~\line out on the old highway...\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line (to the Sheriff)\~
\line Bates' Motel.\~\line (to Lila)\~\line He has a mind like a mechanical brain\~\line and the more information you feed\~\line it... Go on, Sam.\~\line \line SAM\~\line He traced her there and called us to\~\line say he was going to question Mrs.\~
\line Bates...\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line (a pleasant shock)\~\line Norman took a wife?\~\line \line SAM\~\line No. An old woman, his mother.\~\line (to Sheriff, quickly)\~\line That was early this evening. And we\~\line haven't seen or heard from 
him since.\~\line I went out to the motel, just got\~\line back. No one was in the office, and...\~\line \line LILA\~\line (errupting,\~\line anxiously)\~\line Will you help us? I think something's\~\line wrong out there!\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line 
(after a considerate\~\line pause)\~\line Now. Your sister is missing how long?\~\line \line LILA\~\line She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday.\~\line And no trace until...\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line How'd you and this detective come to\~\line 
trace her to Fairvale?\~\line \line SAM\~\line They thought she'd be coming to me.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Left Phoenix under her own steam?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line (a pause)\~\line She ain't missing so much as she's
\~\line run away.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line From what?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (a look at sam, then:)\~\line She stole some money.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line A lot?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Forty thousand dollars.\~\line 
\line SHERIFF\~\line And the police haven't been able\~\line to...\~\line \line SAM\~\line (errupting)\~\line Everyone concerned thought... if\~\line they could get her to give back the\~\line money... they could avoid involving\~\line 
her with the police.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Explains the private detective. He\~\line traced her to the Bates place. What'd\~\line he exactly say when he called you?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Mary had been there, one night, and\~\line had left.\~
\line \line SHERIFF\~\line With the forty thousand dollars?\~\line \line LILA\~\line He didn't mention the money.\~\line (anxiously)\~\line What he said on the phone isn't\~\line important, is it? He was supposed\~\line to come back after he spoke to the
\~\line mother, and he didn't! That's what I\~\line want you to do something about!\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Like what?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Go out there! Find somebody, ask\~\line some questions!\~\line (a pause)\~\line 
I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to\~\line you. I keep thinking... something's\~\line wrong. I have to know what!\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line I think something's wrong, too, Miss.\~\line But not the same thing. I think your\~\line 
private detective is what's wrong.\~\line (As Lila is about to\~\line object)\~\line I think he got himself a hot lead as\~\line to where your sister was going...\~\line probably from Norman Bates... and\~\line called you to keep you still while\~\line 
he took off after her and the money.\~\line \line LILA\~\line He said he was dissatisfied... and\~\line was going back.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line (to Sheriff)\~\line Why don't you call Norman and let\~\line him say just what happened, if he\~
\line give the man a hot lead and he did\~\line just scooted off... it'll make the\~\line girl feel better, Albert.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line At this hour?\~\line \line SAM\~\line He was out when I was there. If he's\~\line 
back he probably isn't even in bed\~\line yet.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line He wasn't out when you were there.\~\line He just wasn't answering the door in\~\line the dead of night... like some people\~\line do. This fellow lives like a hermit...\~\line 
\line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Recluse. Kinder word.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line (to Sam)\~\line You must remember that bad business\~\line out there. About ten years ago...\~\line \line SAM\~\line I've only been here five. Right now\~\line 
it feels like ten, but...\~\line \line LILA\~\line All right! Then call! At least, call!\~\line \line Mrs. Chambers goes to phone, dials operator.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line (o phone)\~\line Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to\~\line 
connect him with the Bates Motel.\~\line \line She hands the receiver to the Sheriff. He takes it,\~\line reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other\~\line end. After a moment:\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line (o phone)\~\line 
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.\~\line (listens)\~\line Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we\~\line got some worries here. Did you have\~\line a man stop out there tonight...\~\line (listens)\~\line Well, this one wouldn't be a customer,\~\line 
anyway. A private detective, name\~\line of...\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Arbogast.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line (o phone)\~\line Arbogast.\~\line (listens)\~\line And after he left?\~\line (listens)\~\line No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been\~
\line going out there?\~\line (listens)\~\line Well, I think you oughta unload that\~\line place and open up closer in to the\~\line action, a smaller place, you know...\~\line but...\~\line \line LILA\~\line Please!\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line (o phone)
\~\line Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to\~\line sleep. Yeah, be glad to.\~\line (hangs up, turns to\~\line Mrs. Chambers)\~\line Said to give you his regards.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (fa irony)\~\line Was that all?\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line 
This detective was out there and\~\line Norman told him about the girl and\~\line the detective thanked him and went\~\line away.\~\line \line LILA\~\line And he didn't go back? Didn't see\~\line the mother?\~\line \line 
The Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head\~\line sympathetically.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line You should've called in the police\~\line the second you found your sister has\~\line skipped. You go starting private\~\line 
investigations, using people you\~\line don't even know...\~\line \line LILA\~\line What difference does that...\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Your Detective told you a nakedfaced\~\line lie.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Barefaced.\~\line \line SHERIFF
\~\line He told you he wasn't coming right\~\line back cause he wanted to question\~\line Norman Bates' mother, right?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line (a pause, then calmly)\~\line Norman Bates' mother has been dead\~\line 
and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for\~\line the last ten years!\~\line \line There is a long silence. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line I helped Norman pick out the dress\~\line she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.\~
\line \line SHERIFF\~\line It ain't only local history, Sam,\~\line it's the only murder-and-suicide\~\line case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.\~\line Bates poisoned this guy she was...\~\line involved with, when she found out he\~\line 
was married, then took a helping of\~\line the same stuff herself. Strychnine.\~\line Ugly way to die.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Norman found them dead together. In\~\line bed.\~\line \line SAM\~\line You mean that old woman I saw sittin'\~\line 
in the window wasn't Norman Bates'\~\line mother?\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line (hopefully, happily)\~\line Maybe you saw Mary!\~\line \line SAM\~\line I'd know the difference between Mary\~\line and an old woman.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line 
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you\~\line saw an old woman?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Yes! In the house behind the motel.\~\line I pounded and called but she... just\~\line ignored me.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line And you want to tell me you saw Norman\~
\line Bates' mother.\~\line \line LILA\~\line It must've been. Arbogast said so,\~\line too... and he said the young man\~\line wouldn't let him see her because she\~\line was ill!\~\line \line 
The Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks\~\line there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Well, if the woman up there is Mrs.\~\line Bates... who's that woman buried out\~\line 
at Greenlawn Cemetery?\~\line \line QUICK :\~\line \line  NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone n to\~\line him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to\~\line 
move his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-\~\line like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and\~\line resolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he\~\line rises, starts quickly out of the 
room, tries to switch off\~\line the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking\~\line the bird off the shade.\~\line \line He watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the\~\line 
floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at\~\line it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust,\~\line tries to press it o the split seam, picks up the bird,\~\line puts it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out,\~
\line crosses the darkened office and goes outside.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly\~\line up to the house, opens the door and goes in.\~\line \line :\~\line 
\line  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)\~\line \line SHOOTING UP THE STAIRS\~\line \line Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door,\~\line then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open.\~\line \line 
For a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his\~\line words indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his\~\line mother's derisive laughter.\~\line \line MOTHER'S VOICE\~\line I am sorry, boy, but you do manage\~\line 
to look ludicrous when you give me\~\line orders!\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line Please, mother...\~\line \line MOTHER'S VOICE\~\line (Sharp, laughter all\~\line gone)\~\line No! I will not hide in the fruit\~\line cellar!\~\line (A shrill laugh)\~
\line Think I'm fruity, huh?\~\line (Hard, cold again)\~\line I'm staying right here! This is my\~\line room and no one will drag me out of\~\line it... least of all my big bold son!\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line (Rising now, anxiously)\~\line 
They'll come now, Mother. He came\~\line after the girl and now someone will\~\line come after him! How long do you think\~\line you can go on... Mother, please,\~\line just for a few days, just so they\~\line won't find you!\~\line \line MOTHER'S VOICE\~
\line (Mimicking)\~\line Just for a few days...\~\line (Furious)\~\line In that dank fruit cellar? No! You\~\line hid me there once, boy, and you won't\~\line do it again! Not ever again! Now\~\line get out!\~\line (A pause, quiet)\~\line 
I told you to get out, boy!\~\line (A longer pause)\~\line Norman! What do you think you're\~\line going to do? Don't you touch me!\~\line Don't! Norman!\~\line (A pause, then\~\line cajolingly)\~\line All right, son, put me down and I'll\~\line 
go. I'll go on my own two feet. I\~\line can go on my own two feet, can't I?\~\line \line During all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the\~\line stairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues\~\line 
on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.\~\line \line She starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE\~\line I'll carry you, mother.\~\line \line Norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms,\~
\line her head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down\~\line the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs,\~\line and then down those stairs to the basement.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  FA
IRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)\~\line \line An overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is\~\line just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little\~\line I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as\~
\line they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways\~\line away.\~\line \line Amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam\~\line and Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no\~\line 
contentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking.\~\line Lila looks as if she has had no sleep.\~\line \line Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward\~\line the church.\~\line \line 
CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and\~\line Mrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at\~\line Lila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely.\~\line \line SAM\~\line We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd\~\line 
go out to the motel with you.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line He's already been.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Went out before service.\~\line \line MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line Have you two had breakfast?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (To Sheriff, not a\~\line 
question)\~\line You didn't find anything.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.\~\line \line He moves away and the others follow. CAMERA PANS them to the\~\line curb.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (errupting)\~\line 
Did he say anything about my sister?\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Just what he told your detective.\~\line \line She used a fake name, saw the register myself. Saw the whole\~\line place, as a matter of fact. That boy is alone there.\~\line \line SAM\~
\line No mother.\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line You must've seen an illusion, Sam.\~\line Now, I know you're not the seeing-\~\line illusion type... But no woman was\~\line illusion there and I don't believe\~\line in ghosts, so there it is!\~\line \line 
LILA\~\line I still feel...\~\line \line SHERIFF\~\line Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't\~\line make you feel better. You want to\~\line come to my office this afternoon and\~\line report a missing person... And the\~\line 
theft, is what you want to do! Sooner\~\line you drop this thing in the lap of\~\line the law, that's the sooner you'll\~\line stand a chance of your sister bein'\~\line picked up. How about that?\~\line \line LILA\~\line I don't know.\~\line \line 
MRS. CHAMBERS\~\line It's Sunday. Come over and do the\~\line reporting at the house, 'round dinner\~\line time. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.\~\line \line She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss\~\line 
this year's charity fandango, takes the\~\line \line Sheriff's arm, starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes.\~\line \line Sam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted\~\line chapel. For a long moment they just stand there, their faces\~
\line as gray and overcast as the sky.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.\~\line \line LILA\~\line You're not.\~\line \line Sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward\~\line 
the spot where his pick-up truck is parked.\~\line \line CAMERA FOLLOWS them.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Want me to drop you at the hotel?\~\line Or you want to come over to the store?\~\line \line Lila does not answer. They reach the truck. Lila looks\~
\line directly at Sam as he helps her o the cab.\~\line \line LILA\~\line I won't feel satisfied unless I got\~\line out there, Sam.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Neither will I.\~\line \line He slams the door, hurries around truck, gets o driver's\~\line 
seat, starts motor. As the truck drives off,\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line SAM AND LILA IN TRUCK - (PROCESS - HIGHWAY)\~\line \line For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if\~\line there were other cars o
n it, Lila staring at nothing in\~\line particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.\~\line \line LILA\~\line I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Of course we will.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Alive.\~\line \line 
Sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something\~\line to cheer her. He cannot. He remains silent.\~\line \line LILA\~\line We lived together all our lives.\~\line \line When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans,\~\line 
Mary quit college and got a job, so I could go to college.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Where'd you go to college?\~\line \line LILA\~\line I didn't. I got a job, too.\~\line (A pause)\~\line I wonder if that hurt her, my not\~\line 
letting her sacrifice for me? Some\~\line people are so willing to suffer for\~\line you that they suffer more if you\~\line don't let them.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Almost to himself)\~\line She was willing to lick the stamps.\~\line \line 
Lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue\~\line it.\~\line \line LILA\~\line I wonder so many things about her\~\line now. Why she never told me about\~\line you... Funny, when you think there's\~\line an answer to everything, you think\~
\line you know all the answers.\~\line \line SAM\~\line We were going to get married. Are\~\line going to get married!\~\line \line LILA\~\line Do you know how I found out about\~\line you? I found one of your letters...\~\line it was a nice letter, Sam.
\~\line \line SAM\~\line This is the old highway.\~\line \line LILA\~\line I suppose... when you were able to\~\line marry her she'd have presented you,\~\line all shiny and proper... she always\~\line tried to be proper.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
Watch your tenses.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Huh?\~\line \line SAM\~\line She always tries to be proper.\~\line \line Sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a\~\line cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.\~\line 
\line LILA\~\line You going to wait here for me?\~\line \line SAM\~\line I'm going with you. But we'd better\~\line decide what we're going to say and\~\line do when we walk in...\~\line \line LILA\~\line We're going to register. As man and\~\line 
wife. And get shown to a cabin...\~\line and then search every inch of that\~\line place, inside and... outside.\~\line \line SAM\~\line You won't believe it...\~\line (Starts motor)\~\line But this will be the first time\~\line 
I've ever pulled one of those man-\~\line and-wife-renting-cabin capers!\~\line \line LILA\~\line (A tiny smile, first\~\line in hours)\~\line I believe it.\~\line \line As truck starts to drive on,\~\line \line :\~\line \line 
 THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep\~\line gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning o the\~\line driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila\~\line 
get out of the truck.\~\line \line FRESH ANGLE\~\line \line Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the\~\line truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in\~\line b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then\~
\line turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the\~\line window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door,\~\line peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the\~\line driveway, beside the truck.\~\line \line :\~\line 
\line  THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)\~\line \line CLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled\~\line the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at\~\line the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is\~\line 
standing by the truck and looking up at the house. Norman\~\line studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he\~\line closes the curtains, turns away.\~\line \line We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic\~\line 
and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA\~\line remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the\~\line frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel\~\line office and joins Lila.\~\line \line 
 MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Unconsciously\~\line whispering)\~\line I wonder where Norman Bates does his\~\line hermiting?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Someone was at that window. I saw\~\line the curtain move.\~\line \line 
Sam takes Lila's arm.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Come on.\~\line \line He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old\~\line house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the\~\line 
office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward\~\line them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor\~\line speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone;\~\line containment and impassivity lie in their place.\~\line \line 
SAM\~\line (Cheerfully)\~\line Just coming up to ring for you.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (Coming forward)\~\line I suppose you want a cabin.\~\line \line SAM\~\line We'd hoped to make it straight to\~\line San Francisco, but we don't like the\~\line look
 of that sky. Looks like a bad\~\line day coming... doesn't it.\~\line \line Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick,\~\line disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying,\~\line 
goes onto the porch and o the office. Sam and Lila follow\~\line Norman.\~\line \line  MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to\~\line cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have\~\line 
entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I'll take you to...\~\line \line SAM\~\line Better sign in first, hasn't we?\~\line \line Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.\~\line \line NORMAN\~
\line It isn't necessary.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (errupting with a\~\line friendly cheerfulness)\~\line Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this\~\line trip... ninety percent business...\~\line and he wants practically notarized\~\line rece
ipts. I better sign in and get a\~\line receipt.\~\line \line Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call\~\line him "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings\~\line out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the
\~\line book as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson." The\~\line signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the\~\line notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations\~\line above Sam's.\~\line \line 
When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman.\~\line Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I'll get your bags.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Haven't any.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (after a stare)\~
\line I'll show you the cabin.\~\line \line As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns,\~\line looks at him.\~\line \line SAM\~\line First time I've seen it happen.\~\line (to Lila)\~\line Check in any place in this country\~\line 
without bags, and you have to pay in\~\line advance.\~\line \line Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his\~\line pocket.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Ten dollars...\~\line \line Norman returns to Sam, takes the ended bill, is about to\~
\line start out again.\~\line \line SAM\~\line That receipt...?\~\line \line Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to\~\line cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under\~\line 
counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks\~\line up the key, quickly, starts out.\~\line \line LILA\~\line I'll start ahead.\~\line \line Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.\~\line \line  THE MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries\~\line the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam\~\line and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down\~\line the porch.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (To Norman, who is\~
\line following)\~\line Don't bother yourself... we'll find\~\line it.\~\line \line He goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one,\~\line walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches\~\line cabin twelve. CAMERA REMAI
NS with Norman, who is standing by\~\line the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert\~\line and no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have\~\line closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.\~\line 
CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in\~\line through the driver's window, twists the registration card\~\line around, reads it.\~\line \line It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.\~\line \line 
Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward\~\line cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are\~\line confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his\~\line 
face. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the\~\line path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes\~\line in.\~\line \line  CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)\~\line \line Lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining\~\line 
for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from\~\line the window of this cabin.\~\line \line She turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot\~\line of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased\~\line in a sadness.\~
\line \line LILA\~\line We should have asked for Cabin One...\~\line The one Mary was in.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I'm glad we didn't.\~\line \line He pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits\~\line 
wearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment,\~\line feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge,\~\line turns again and looks at Sam's back.\~\line \line LILA\~\line We have to go o that cabin and\~\line 
search it, Sam... no matter what\~\line we're afraid of finding and no matter\~\line how much it may hurt.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I know.\~\line (A pause)\~\line Do you think if something happened,\~\line it happened there?\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
(A pause, then:)\~\line Sam, if you owned a useless business\~\line like this motel... one you probably\~\line couldn't even sell... what would\~\line you need to get away, to start a new\~\line business, somewhere else?\~\line (As Sam studies her)\~
\line Forty thousand dollars?\~\line \line SAM\~\line How could we prove...\~\line (An almost hopeless\~\line laugh)\~\line Well, if he opens a new motel on the\~\line new highway... say, a year from now...\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
There must be some proof that exists\~\line right now! Something that proves he\~\line got that money away from Mary...\~\line Some way!\~\line \line SAM\~\line What makes you sound so certain?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or\~
\line felt sorry for me... and he was\~\line starting to feel the same about you.\~\line I heard it when he called... in his\~\line voice, a caring. He wouldn't have\~\line gone anywhere or done anything without\~\line telling us. Unless he was stopped.\~
\line And he was stopped, so he must have\~\line found out something!\~\line \line Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.\~\line \line SAM\~\line We'll start with Cabin One.\~\line \line He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then,\~
\line back to Lila:\~\line \line SAM\~\line If he sees us... we're just taking\~\line the air.\~\line \line Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out.\~\line \line  THE MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand.\~\line \line Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin\~\line One. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin\~\line One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on\~
\line to the office, opens the door, calls in:\~\line \line SAM\~\line Bates?\~\line \line He waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment\~\line comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.\~\line \line 
She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started\~\line to enter.\~\line \line  CABIN ONE - (DAY)\~\line \line The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.\~\line \line Sam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.\~\line 
\line For a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to\~\line tell them some satisfactory story.\~\line \line Neither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search,\~\line going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the\~
\line closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners,\~\line not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to\~\line find some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The\~\line 
windowless room is very dark. She switches on the light,\~\line goes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow\~\line her in when he notices which room it is and automatically\~\line catches himself up, backs out.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
Sorry.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Hospital clean.\~\line \line SAM\~\line What?\~\line \line LILA\~\line The bathroom. Look at how clean it\~\line is. The one in our cabin is clean...\~\line but this is clean!\~\line \line Sa
m goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the\~\line medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny\~\line tabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the\~\line tub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more\~
\line erested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence\~\line he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower\~\line curtain rod.\~\line \line And realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about\~\line 
to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of\~\line shot, errupts.\~\line \line Sam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above\~\line the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip\~\line of her right index finger.
\~\line \line SAM\~\line What is it?\~\line \line LILA\~\line It didn't get washed down. It's\~\line figuring... the kind you tear up and\~\line get rid of.\~\line (ending her finger\~\line toward Sam)\~\line Some figure has been added to or\~\line 
subtracted from... forty thousand.\~\line \line Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it,\~\line takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's\~\line license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet\~\line away.
\~\line \line LILA\~\line That's proof Mary was here! It would\~\line be too wild a coincidence for somebody\~\line else to...\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Reminding)\~\line Bates never denied Mary was here.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (Reminded)\~\line Yes.\~
\line (A thought)\~\line But maybe this proves that Bates\~\line found out about the money.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Do we simply ask him where he's hidden\~\line it?\~\line \line LILA\~\line Sam, that old woman, whoever she is.\~\line 
I think she told Arbogast something!\~\line And I want her to tell us the same\~\line thing!\~\line \line She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm,\~\line stops her.\~\line \line SAM\~\line You can't go up there.\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
Why not?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Bates.\~\line \line CAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them, moves slowly over the\~\line room, very slowly.\~\line \line LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line Let's find him. One of us can keep\~\line him occupied while the other ge
ts to\~\line the woman.\~\line \line SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line You won't be able to hold him still\~\line if he doesn't want to be held. And I\~\line don't like you going o that house\~\line alone, Lila.\~\line \line 
CAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and\~\line is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall\~\line paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.\~\line \line LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line I can handle a sick old woman.\~
\line \line Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is\~\line the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch\~\line Mary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now.\~\line \line SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line 
All right. I'll find Bates and keep\~\line him occupied.\~\line \line The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before\~\line the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung\~\line paing.\~\line \line FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM\~
\line \line They are about to start out. Sam stops her again.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Wait a minute. If you get anything\~\line out of the mother...\~\line (A thought)\~\line Can you find your way back to town?\~\line (As Lila nods yes)\~\line 
If you do get anything, don't stop\~\line to tell me.\~\line \line Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first,\~\line opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough\~\line for Lila and Himself to pass through.\~\line 
\line  THE MOTEL - (DAY)\~\line \line ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her\~\line left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at\~\line the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes\~\line 
the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside\~\line the open door.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Looking for me?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Recovering)\~\line Yes, matter of fact.\~\line (The friendly grin)\~\line 
The wife's taking a nap and... I can\~\line never keep quiet enough for her...\~\line so I thought I'd look you up and...\~\line talk.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Satisfied with your cabin?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Fine.\~\line \line 
Sam starts o the office. Just before going in, he glances\~\line down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of\~\line cabin twelve, waves her a tiny "all clear" signal.\~\line \line LILA\~\line \line 
CAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her po of view.\~\line \line She watches Sam disappear o the office, waits until she\~\line hears the door close, then looks about for another way to\~\line reach the house. She sees the small alley at the end of this\~
\line L of cabins, starts toward it.\~\line \line  REAR OF MOTEL - S.C.U. LILA - (DAY)\~\line \line Behind the motel Lila hesitates. She looks ahead.\~\line \line LONG SHOT - (DAY)\~\line \line The old house standing against the sky.\~\line \line 
CLOSE UP - (DAY)\~\line \line Lila moves forward.\~\line \line LONG SHOT - (DAY)\~\line \line The CAMERA approaching the house.\~\line \line CLOSE UP - (DAY)\~\line \line Lila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor. She moves\~\line on.\~\line \line 
LONG SHOT - (DAY)\~\line \line The house coming nearer.\~\line \line CLOSE UP - (DAY)\~\line \line Lila looks up at the house. She moves forward purposefully.\~\line \line S.L.S. - (DAY)\~\line \line The house and the porch.\~\line \line CLOSE UP - (DAY)
\~\line \line Lila stops at the house and looks up. She glances back.\~\line \line She turns to the house again.\~\line \line S.L.S. - (DAY)\~\line \line The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch.\~\line \line C.U. - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila puts out her hand.\~\line \line S.C.U. - (DAY)\~\line \line Lila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway.\~\line \line Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA.\~\line \line  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet,\~\line listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which\~\line leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and\~\line the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the
\~\line kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent.\~\line She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares\~\line at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor.\~\line 
She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor\~\line and dining room.\~\line \line  THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line Norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who\~\line 
is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of\~\line one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a\~\line protective wall against the threatening world across it.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Cheerfully, as if\~\line after a
 self-conscious\~\line pause)\~\line I've been doing all the talking so\~\line far, haven't I?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Yes.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I always thought it was the people\~\line who are alone so much who do all the\~\line 
talking when they get the chance.\~\line Yet there you are, doing all the\~\line listening!\~\line (A pause)\~\line You are alone here, aren't you?\~\line (As Norman does not\~\line reply)\~\line It would drive me crazy.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line 
That would be a rather reme\~\line reaction, wouldn't it?\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Lightly)\~\line Just an expression...\~\line (More seriously)\~\line What I meant was... I'd do just about\~\line anything... to get away. Wouldn't\~\line you?\~\line 
\line  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line Lila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled\~\line by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She\~\line steps more carefully. CAMERA remains a
t foot of stair, TILTING\~\line UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The\~\line door on her right, which opens o the mother's room, is\~\line closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly\~\line 
before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment,\~\line trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on\~\line the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door,\~\line the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.\~
\line \line  THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR\~\line \line We hear Lila's second knock, then, faly, her soft call.\~\line \line LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line Mrs. Bates?\~\line \line There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open,\~
\line and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at\~\line the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her\~\line expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go\~\line away from this room forever.\~\line \line 
After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind\~\line her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as\~\line Lila sees it.\~\line \line It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe,\~\line 
an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of\~\line the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the\~\line dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a\~\line great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, ov
al, full-\~\line length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite\~\line the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the\~\line window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled\~\line with ashes.\~\line \line 
And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if\~\line even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long\~\line vacated by some musty presence.\~\line \line Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over\~\line 
it, but it is not neat, there is the impr of a body on\~\line it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-\~\line like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes\~\line to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and
\~\line jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an\~\line opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of\~\line hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of\~\line 
herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to\~\line the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high\~\line wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it,\~\line hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed\~
\line dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters\~\line and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-\~\line type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.\~\line Along the floor of th
e wardrobe is a line of clean, polished\~\line shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once\~\line again over the whole room, starts out,\~\line \line  THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind\~\line her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to\~\line the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark,\~\line the shades drawn full.\~\line \line 
Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall,\~\line throws on a switch.\~\line \line  MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.\~\line \line SAM\~\line I'm not saying you shouldn't be\~\line 
contented here, I'm just doubting\~\line that you are. I think if you saw a\~\line chance to get out from under...\~\line you'd unload this place...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (Angrily)\~\line This place! This isn't 'a place.'\~\line 
It's my only world. I grew up in\~\line that house back there. I was a happy\~\line child. My mother and I... we were\~\line more than happy.\~\line \line SAM\~\line And now that your mother's dead?\~\line \line 
Norman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line My mother is not dead!\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Softly)\~\line I didn't think so.\~\line \line  NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick\~\line dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy\~\line of childhood held beyond the po of decency.\~\line \line It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping\~\line 
silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and\~\line fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far\~\line too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled\~\line covers indicate that it is i
n this bed that Norman sleeps.\~\line N to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top\~\line there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an\~\line ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's\~\line 
shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.\~\line \line Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled\~\line with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white\~\line chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record\~\line 
on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be\~\line Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.\~\line \line Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances\~\line at the bookcase, comes o the room, goes to the bookcase\~\line 
and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens\~\line it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust.\~\line She slams the book closed, drops it.\~\line \line  THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Norman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall.\~\line Sam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning\~\line forward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.\~\line \line Norman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark,\~
\line high sheen of a cornered animal.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (Pressing)\~\line You look frightened. Have I been\~\line saying something frightening?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line I don't know what you've been saying.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
I've been talking about your mother...\~\line about your motel. How are you going\~\line to do it?\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Do what?\~\line \line SAM\~\line Buy a new one! In a new town!\~\line Where you won't have to hide your\~\line mother!\~\line 
\line NORMAN\~\line Shut up!\~\line \line SAM\~\line Where will you get the money to do\~\line that, Bates... or do you already\~\line have it... socked away... a lot of\~\line it...\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Leave me alone!\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
...Forty thousand dollars!\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Leave me alone!\~\line \line He is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back\~\line o his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter,\~\line follows.\~\line \line  NORMAN'S PRIVATE PA
RLOR - (DAY)\~\line \line Norman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached\~\line by this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear\~\line window, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.\~\line 
Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away\~\line as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief\~\line flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to\~\line gaze at Norman, hard.\~\line \line SAM\~\line 
I bet your mother knows where the\~\line money is. And what you did to get\~\line it. And I think she'll tell us.\~\line \line Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives\~\line Norman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances\~
\line out the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and\~\line there is terror in his voice.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line Where's that girl? The girl you came\~\line with! Where is she?\~\line \line 
Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine\~\line a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line (A horrible groan)\~\line Oh, God!\~\line \line  UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out\~\line of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in\~\line the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite\~\line the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the\~
\line bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.\~\line \line  NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)\~\line \line Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A\~\line candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking\~
\line as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's\~\line footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse\~\line of him going out o the office, almost at a run.\~\line \line  STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.\~\line \line She is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound\~\line she might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down\~\line 
the stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the\~\line front door, sees out through the door window:\~\line \line LILA'S VIEWPO - (DAY)\~\line \line Norman coming.\~\line \line  STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps,\~\line cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the\~\line stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The\~\line 
SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard.\~\line Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the\~\line basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching\~\line there.\~\line \line 
Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens.\~\line He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He\~\line seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes\~\line 
from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time\~\line state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.\~\line \line Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to\~\line the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed\~\line 
by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an\~\line upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs\~\line for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the\~\line steps, is about to turn o the hallway when her eye is
\~\line caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses,\~\line looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the\~\line not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving\~\line 
SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.\~\line \line Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while\~\line she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check\~\line that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she\~
\line desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what\~\line happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down\~\line the stairs.\~\line \line  THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\~\line \line 
Lila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards\~\line creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She\~\line turns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman\~\line is sitting in a comfortable cha
ir, the back of the chair,\~\line and the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh,\~\line frightened whisper.\~\line \line LILA\~\line Mrs. Bates...?\~\line \line Lila goes o the room.\~\line \line  THE FRUIT CELLAR\~\line \line 
Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the\~\line figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise\~\line movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a\~\line woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the\~
\line mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.\~\line The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose\~\line has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are\~\line 
sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and\~\line flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed\~\line dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.\~\line \line 
The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning\~\line as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually\~\line graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.\~\line \line 
Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins\~\line to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.\~\line \line And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more\~\line dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind\~\line 
her.\~\line \line NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line (screaming)\~\line Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma\~\line Bates!\~\line \line Lila turns.\~\line \line NORMAN\~\line \line His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a\~\line 
woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is\~\line similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand\~\line is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long\~\line breadknife in it.\~\line \line LILA\~\line \line 
Close on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.\~\line \line BACK TO NORMAN\~\line \line As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in\~\line from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes\~\line 
through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling\~\line back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman,\~\line football tackle style.\~\line \line SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT\~\line \line 
Norman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face,\~\line the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified,\~\line fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.\~\line \line MRS. BATES\~\line \line 
A close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying\~\line the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the\~\line screams of Norman.\~\line \line DISSOLVE TO:\~\line \line  COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)\~\line \line 
There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious\~\line and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of\~\line newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit\~\line 
truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and\~\line chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the\~\line sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being\~\line moved o the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and
\~\line the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back.\~\line The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden\~\line light thrown on a fearful darkness.\~\line \line CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE\~\line \line 
A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men,\~\line muttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION\~\line MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and\~\line CAMERA FOLLOWS him o the courthouse vestibule.\~\line \line 
Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters,\~\line Television Men. The Television Men we have been following\~\line stops beside a Policeman.\~\line \line TELEVISION MAN\~\line (Indicating the front\~\line door he has just\~\line 
come in through)\~\line You think they'll take him out that\~\line way?\~\line \line POLICEMAN\~\line (Looking at waiting\~\line crowd, shrugging)\~\line Probably have to.\~\line (A rueful smile)\~\line Besides, the taxpayers hate it when\~\line 
something gets slipped out the back\~\line door on them!\~\line \line Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement\~\line of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door\~\line 
of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow\~\line with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-\~\line for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY\~\line pauses a moment, then goes o the room.\~\line \line :
\~\line \line  OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)\~\line \line Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart\~\line from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with\~\line 
the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT\~\line ATTORNEY.\~\line \line The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes\~\line a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila,\~\line checking the notation on the lid as he
 goes.\~\line \line MED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA\~\line \line SAM\~\line (quietly)\~\line It's regular. Okay?\~\line \line LILA\~\line (ruefully)\~\line I could stand something regular.\~\line \line Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff\~
\line Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has\~\line brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.\~\line \line For a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam\~\line disheveled, but contained.\~\line \line CHAMBERS\~
\line You two can go on home if you like.\~\line (a sympathetic look\~\line at Lila)\~\line Making that statement was enough for\~\line one night.\~\line \line SAM\~\line (to Lila)\~\line Want to?\~\line \line LILA\~\line 
No. I'm all right. I'll feel better\~\line when all this is explained... if it\~\line can be.\~\line \line Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs\~\line doubtfully.\~\line \line CHAMBERS\~\line If anybody gets any answers, it'll\~\line 
be the fellow talking to him now...\~\line the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't\~\line reach Norman... and he knows me.\~\line (to Lila)\~\line You warm enough, Miss?\~\line \line Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come o the\~\line 
room and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn,\~\line follow her gaze.\~\line \line  OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT\~\line \line A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come o\~\line the room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.
\~\line \line He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has\~\line been placed, takes up a container.\~\line \line DISTRICT ATTORNEY\~\line Did he talk to you?\~\line \line SIMON\~\line No. I got the whole story... but not\~\line 
from Norman. I got it from... his\~\line mother.\~\line \line Everyone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes\~\line lid from coffee container.\~\line \line SIMON\~\line Norman Bates no longer exists. He\~\line only half-existed to begin with...
\~\line now, the other half has taken over.\~\line Probably for all time.\~\line \line LILA\~\line (With difficulty)\~\line Did he kill my sister?\~\line \line SIMON\~\line Yes... and no.\~\line \line DISTRICT ATTORNEY\~\line 
Look, if you're trying to lay a lot\~\line of psychiatric groundwork for some\~\line sort of plea this fellow would like\~\line to cop...\~\line \line SIMON\~\line A psychiatrist doesn't lay the\~\line groundwork .. he merely tries to\~\line explain it.\~
\line \line LILA\~\line But my sister is...\~\line \line SIMON\~\line Yes. I'm sorry.\~\line (to Chambers)\~\line The Private Investigator, too. If\~\line you drag that swamp somewhere in the\~\line vicinity of the motel...\~\line (To the Chief of Police)
\~\line Have you any unsolved missing persons\~\line cases on your books?\~\line \line CHIEF OF POLICE\~\line Yes. Two.\~\line \line SIMON\~\line Young girls?\~\line \line CHIEF OF POLICE\~\line (nods, astounded,\~\line then:)\~\line Did he confess to...
\~\line \line SIMON\~\line (errupting)\~\line As I said, the mother...\~\line (Pauses, goes on afresh)\~\line To understand it, as I understood it\~\line hearing it from the mother... That\~\line is, from the mother-half of Norman's\~\line 
mind, you have to go back ten years...\~\line to the time when Norman murdered his\~\line mother and her lover.\~\line (A pause, then as no\~\line one errupts)\~\line He was already dangerously disturbed,\~\line had been ever since his father died.\~
\line His mother was a clinging, demanding\~\line woman... and for years the two of\~\line them lived as if there was no one\~\line else in the world. Then she met a\~\line man and it seemed to Norman she "threw\~\line him over" for this man. That pushed
\~\line him over the thin line... and he\~\line killed them both. Matricide is\~\line probably the most unbearable crime\~\line of all... and most unbearable to the\~\line son who commit it. So he had to erase\~\line the crime, at least in his own mind.\~
\line (A pause)\~\line He stole her corpse... and a weighted\~\line coffin was buried. He hid the body\~\line in the fruit cellar, even "treated"\~\line it to keep it as well as it would\~\line keep. And that still wasn't enough.\~\line 
She was there, but she was a corpse.\~\line So he began to think and speak for\~\line her, gave her half his life, so to\~\line speak. At times he could be both\~\line personalities, carry on\~\line conversations... at other times, the\~\line 
mother-half took over completely. He\~\line was never all Norman, but he was\~\line often only mother. And because he\~\line was so pathologically jealous of\~\line her, he assumed she was as jealous\~\line of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong\~\line 
attraction to any other woman, the\~\line mother side of him would go wild.\~\line (To Lila)\~\line When Norman met your sister, he was\~\line touched by her... and aroused by\~\line her. He wanted her. And this set off\~\line 
his "jealous mother" and... "mother\~\line killed the girl." After the murder,\~\line Norman returned as if from a deep\~\line sleep... and like a dutiful son,\~\line covered up all traces of the crime\~\line he was convinced his mother had\~\line 
committed.\~\line \line SAM\~\line Why was he... dressed like that?\~\line \line DISTRICT ATTORNEY\~\line He's a transvestite!\~\line \line SIMON\~\line Not exactly. A man who dresses in\~\line woman's clothing in order to achieve\~\line a sexual chang
e... or satisfaction...\~\line is a transvestite. But in Norman's\~\line case, he was simply doing everything\~\line possible to keep alive the illusion\~\line of his mother being alive. And\~\line whenever reality came too close,\~\line 
when danger or desire threatened\~\line that illusion, he'd dress up, even\~\line to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd\~\line walk about the house, sit in her\~\line chair, speak in her voice... He tried\~\line to be his mother.\~\line (A sad smile)\~
\line And now he is.\~\line (A pause)\~\line That's what I meant when I said I\~\line got the story from the mother. She\~\line thinks Norman has been taken away...\~\line because of his crimes. She insists\~\line she did nothing, that Norman committed\~
\line all the murders just to keep her\~\line from being discovered. She even smiled\~\line a bit coquettishly as she said that.\~\line Of course, she feels badly about\~\line it... but also somewhat relieved to\~\line be, as she put it, free of Norman,\~
\line at last.\~\line (A pause)\~\line When the mind houses two\~\line personalities, there is always a\~\line battle. In Norman's case, the battle\~\line is over... and the dominant\~\line personality has won.\~\line \line Lila b
egins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for\~\line Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world.\~\line Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.\~\line \line CHAMBERS\~\line (To Simon)\~\line 
And the forty thousand dollars? Who\~\line got that?\~\line \line SIMON\~\line The swamp. These were murders of\~\line passion, not profit.\~\line \line A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-\~\line 
whisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a\~\line folded blanket over his arm.\~\line \line POLICE GUARD\~\line He feels a little chill... can I\~\line bring him this blanket?\~\line \line 
The Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA\~\line FOLLOWS him out of the room and out o the hallway. Guard\~\line moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.\~\line \line :\~\line \line  ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE\~\line 
\line A narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of\~\line shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered\~\line glass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking\~\line 
reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance\~\line o the room.\~\line \line The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this\~\line corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed\~\line 
Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in.\~\line \line Shot is RAKED so that we can not see o the room.\~\line \line After a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard\~\line closes and locks the door and we\~\line \line \line 
 NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)\~\line \line The walls are white and plain. There is no window.\~\line \line There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which\~\line Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality\~\line 
of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.\~\line \line The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.\~\line Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding\~\line it. His face, although without makeup and without the
\~\line surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity\~\line about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch\~\line womanliness about the brows.\~\line \line Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if\~\line 
it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so\~\line that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in\~\line position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the\~\line voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.
\~\line \line MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)\~\line It's sad... when a mother has to\~\line speak the words that condemn her own\~\line son... but I couldn't allow them to\~\line believe that I would commit murder.\~\line (A pause)\~\line 
They'll put him away now... as I\~\line should have... years ago. He was\~\line always... bad. And in the end, he\~\line ended to tell them I killed those\~\line girls... and that man. As if I could\~\line do anything except just sit and\~\line 
stare... like one of his stuffed\~\line birds.\~\line (A pause)\~\line Well, they know I can't even move a\~\line finger. And I won't. I'll just sit\~\line here and be quiet. Just in case they\~\line do... suspect me.\~\line \line A fly buzzes close, and 
then continues buzzing and flying\~\line about Norman's face.\~\line \line MOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)\~\line They're probably watching me. Well,\~\line let them. Let them see what kind of\~\line a person I am.\~\line (A pause, as the fly\~\line 
lights on Norman's\~\line hand)\~\line I'm not going to swat that fly. I\~\line hope they are watching. They'll see...\~\line they'll see... and they'll know...\~\line and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't\~\line even harm a fly...'\~\line \line 
Norman continues to gaze ahead to nothing.\~\line \line }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf18\insrsid16077226\charrsid6711647

Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation whi
ch has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:
\par In the course of the last four months it has been made probable\emdash through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America\emdash 
that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radiu
m-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.
\par This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable\emdash though much less certain\emdash that extremely powerful bomb
s of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy 
for transportation by air.
\par The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.
\par In view of this situation yo
u may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has
 your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:
\par a)\~ to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.
\par b)\~ to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, i
f such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.
\par I understand that German
y has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizs\'e4
cker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.

\par The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the

\par of soldier ants, seventy-five men, at combat readiness,
\par assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness.
\par

\par GEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and
\par falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD

\par \tab What the hell ... ?
\par 
\par In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head
\par shaking into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the
\par force of a truck. FRANK slams into the ground as all the air
\par rushes from his lungs. He begins gasping and
\par hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as he
\par gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The
\par MEN watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond
\par reason into all-out panic.
\par 
\par Suddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet
\par and, without warning, attacks the MEN around him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab God Almighty!
\par 
\par PAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the
\par ground. JACOB jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into
\par the tall grass. PAUL rushes to his assistance.
\par 
\par JACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him.
\par It is the face of a madman.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Good God! What's happening?
\par 
\par The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting
\par erupting behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light
\par penetrate the darkening sky.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Behind you! Look out! This is it!
\par 
\par The MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet,
\par leaving JACOB alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with
\par demonic force as he gathers his strength.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Don't leave me.
\par 
\par Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming
\par at them. SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab They're coming!
\par 
\par Gunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He
\par begins screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and
\par skin. FRANK is struggling like four men and JACOB is
\par weakening in his effort to restrain him. Bayonets glimmer in
\par the exchange of fire. Bodies fall. More bodies keep coming.
\par The first wave is upon them.
\par 
\par ROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward
\par screaming like banshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his
\par bayonet, piercing the belly of his attacker. Agonizing cries
\par accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet out and stabs
\par again.
\par 
\par In the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and
\par slams the butt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a
\par cracking sound. JACOB's eyes freeze with pain. His hands
\par rush for his spine. As he spins around one of the ATTACKERS
\par jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into JACOB's
\par stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.
\par 
\par 
\par CUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a
\par long dark tunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed
\par accelerating toward a brilliant light. The rush suggests a
\par passage between life and death, but as the light bursts upon
\par us we realize that we are passing through a SUBWAY STATION
\par far below the city of NEW YORK.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  SUBWAY - NIGHT
\par 
\par THE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station.
\par JACOB SINGER, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. The
\par sounds of the scream and the grating wheels merge. He is
\par dazed and confused, not certain where he is.
\par 
\par JACOB glances around the empty car. His eyes gravitate to
\par overhead advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and
\par savings banks. Gradually his confusion subsides. Shifting
\par uncomfortably he pulls a thick book out of his back pocket,
\par "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. He begins reading. Another
\par station blurs by.
\par 
\par JACOB is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence. He is
\par in his mid-thirties. It is surprising that he is wearing a
\par mailman's uniform. He doesn't look like one.
\par 
\par The subway ride seems to go on interminably. JACOB is
\par restless and concerned. He glances at his watch. It is 3:30
\par A.M. Putting his book in his back pocket, JACOB stands up
\par and makes his way through the deserted car.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. The
\par wheels spark against the rails. The dark tunnel walls flash
\par by. He pulls the handle on the door to the next car. It is
\par stuck. He struggles with it. A LADY sitting alone inside
\par turns to look at him. She seems threatened by his effort. He
\par motions for her to help. She turns away.
\par 
\par A look of disgust crosses JACOB's face. He kicks the door.
\par It slides open. The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches
\par her.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Excuse me, do you know if we've
\par \tab passed Nostrand Avenue yet?
\par \tab \tab (she doesn't answer)
\par \tab Excuse me.
\par \tab \tab (she does not
\par \tab \tab acknowledge his
\par \tab \tab existence)
\par \tab Look, I'm asking a simple question.
\par \tab Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell
\par \tab asleep.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab \tab (speaking with a Puerto
\par \tab \tab Rican accent)
\par \tab I no from around here.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (glad for a response)
\par \tab Yeah, you and everyone else.
\par 
\par JACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down. The
\par only other passenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the
\par fiberglass bench. Occasionally his body shudders. It is the
\par only sign of life in him.
\par 
\par The train begins to slow down. JACOB peers out of the
\par window. Nostrand Avenue signs appear. He is relieved. He
\par gets up and grabs hold of the overhead bar.
\par 
\par The OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat. As he
\par adjusts his position, tugging at his coat, JACOB catches a
\par brief glimpse of something protruding from beneath the
\par coat's hem. His eyes fixate on the spot, waiting for another
\par look. There is a slight movement and it appears - a long,
\par red, fleshy protuberance. The sight of it sends shivers up
\par JACOB's spine. It looks strangely like a tail. Only the
\par stopping of the train breaks JACOB's stare.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB is the only passenger getting off. The doors close
\par quickly behind him. He glances at the LADY sitting by the
\par window. There is a fearful expression on her face as the
\par train carries her back into the dark tunnel, out of his
\par sight.
\par 
\par JACOB reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door
\par surrounded by floor to ceiling gates. He is about to push
\par when he notices a chain locking it shut. He stares at it in
\par disbelief.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Goddam it.
\par 
\par He turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the
\par platform. As he approaches the far exit, his eyes widen. The
\par gate there is also locked. His hands reach for his hips as
\par he studies an impossible situation.
\par 
\par CUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down
\par to the tracks. A rat scampers by and he gasps.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No way!
\par 
\par He starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is
\par nowhere else to go. He juts out his jaw and steps back down.
\par 
\par JACOB is not comfortable on the tracks. He cannot see where
\par he is stepping. His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which
\par makes him grimace. The steel girders are coated in subway
\par grime. The oily substance coats his hands as he reaches for
\par support.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Goddam fucking city!
\par 
\par He wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward
\par the center track. He reaches for another girder when it
\par begins to vibrate. Two pinpoints of light hurl toward him.
\par Then the noise arrives confirming his fear. A train is
\par bearing down on him. JACOB looks frightened, not sure which
\par way to go. He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. He
\par cannot tell which track the train is on. It is moving at
\par phenomenal speed. The station is spinning. The train's
\par lights merge into one brilliant intensity.
\par 
\par In near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train
\par spins by. Its velocity blows his hair straight up as though
\par it is standing on end. He clings to a pillar for support,
\par gasping in short breaths.
\par 
\par A few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train. Their
\par faces, pressed up against the glass, seem deformed. A lone
\par figure waves at him from the rear window. The train bears
\par them all away. Then it is quiet again. For a moment JACOB is
\par afraid to move but slowly regains his composure. He
\par continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up
\par the ladder to the UPTOWN PLATFORM.
\par 
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab CUT TO:
\par 
\par JACOB smiling. The smile, however, is one of irony, not
\par amusement. This exit too is locked. A heavy chain is wrapped
\par through the bars. JACOB stares at it with an expression of
\par total bewilderment.
\par 
\par A sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone.
\par His head turns but sees no one. He hears the scream again.
\par He senses its direction and walks toward the MEN'S ROOM. A
\par crack of light appears under the door. He can hear someone
\par moaning inside. JACOB knocks softly and the moaning stops.
\par The lights click off.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Hey, is someone in there?
\par 
\par There is no answer. JACOB stands silently for a moment, not
\par sure what to do. He can hear whispering. He chews his lower
\par lip nervously and then reaches for the door. It pushes open.
\par 
\par The light from the station penetrates the darkness. He
\par gasps. He sees a MAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER
\par NAKED MAN grabbing quickly for his clothes. The BOUND MAN
\par screams.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab BOUND MAN
\par \tab Fuck off! Mind your own business!
\par 
\par A THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at
\par JACOB's throat.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN
\par \tab You cocksucker! Get outta here.
\par 
\par The MAN's face is barely human. Before JACOB can even react
\par the door slams shut. The lock engages. The crack of light
\par reappears. JACOB can hear laughter coming from inside,
\par followed by a scream. He backs away from the door. His face
\par is white.
\par 
\par JACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate. The chain
\par gives wayto his anger. It flies apart and the gate flings
\par open. He stands in amazement, observing the chain as it
\par slides from between the bars and drops to the concrete
\par below. The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes it aside and
\par clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN
\par 
\par JACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC
\par HOUSING PROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes
\par the huge monolithic structures. JACOB passes through a vast
\par COURTYARD dominated by the imposing shapes. Aside from his
\par moving body everything is still.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  HALLWAY - DAWN
\par 
\par JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long
\par impersonal hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to
\par his APARTMENT.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN
\par 
\par JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He
\par tries to navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a
\par tiny nightlight in the distance. His effort is unsuccessful.
\par He bangs loudly into a table. A WOMAN"s voice calls out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE (V.O.)
\par \tab Jake, is that you?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What the hell did you do, move all

\par \tab I moved the couch. That's all.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Where to?
\par 
\par JACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL
\par "JEZZIE" PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a
\par man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy,
\par disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that
\par JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab That help?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (nearly sprawled over
\par \tab \tab the couch)
\par \tab Thanks.
\par 
\par He pushes himself up.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab What do you think?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What do you mean?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come
\par \tab you're so late?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Roberts didn't show up. What could I
\par \tab say? Besides, it's double time.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (seeing the grease on
\par \tab \tab his uniform)
\par \tab What happened to you?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (unbuttoning his shirt
\par \tab \tab as he walks to the
\par \tab \tab BATHROOM)
\par \tab Don't ask.
\par 
\par JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes,
\par leaving them in a pile on the floor. He reaches for the
\par faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the
\par porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's nakedness. She reaches
\par out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. His body
\par tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter the
\par shower together.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
\par 
\par A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water.
\par JACOB is crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese
\par JUNGLE. His shirt is bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping
\par on his right forearm. His left arm is holding his intestines
\par from spilling onto the grass.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Help me. Someone.
\par 
\par Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It
\par dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It
\par is impossible to see who is carrying it. The light darts
\par near the ground where JACOB is lying and then bursts
\par directly into his eyes.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY
\par 
\par SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping
\par fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand
\par rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is
\par done. He is awake.
\par 
\par JACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand
\par gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for
\par his glasses. He has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps
\par blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends
\par it crashing to the floor. He sits up with a disgusted look
\par on his face and searches the out-of-focus shelf behind him.
\par Suddenly JEZZIE enters.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE

\par \tab \tab (she scans the shelf)
\par \tab Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.

\par She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Thanks.

\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (nodding)
\par \tab Gabe.
\par 
\par JEZZIE is silent. JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Sorry. it just took me by surprise. I
\par \tab didn't expect to see him this morning
\par \tab ... God, what I wouldn't ... He was
\par \tab the cutest little guy. Like an angel,
\par \tab you know. He had this smile ...
\par \tab \tab (choking up again)
\par \tab Fuck, I don't even remember this
\par \tab picture.
\par 
\par Hiding his emotions, JACOB scrambles over the bed and
\par reaches for a pair of pants. He pulls out his wallet and
\par then carefully puts the photo of GABE inside. It joins
\par photos of his two other boys. JEZZIE begins shoving the
\par remaining pictures back into the paper bag.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Wait. Don't.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab I don't like things that make you
\par \tab cry.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I just want to look ...
\par 
\par He reaches into the pile for other snapshots. We see an
\par array of frozen moments, happy, unfocused, obscure. Suddenly
\par he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab God, this is me!
\par \tab \tab (he holds up a baby
\par \tab \tab photo)
\par \tab Look. It's dated right after I was
\par \tab born.
\par \tab \tab (he stares at it
\par \tab \tab intently)
\par \tab What a kid. Cute, huh? So much
\par \tab promise.
\par 
\par JEZZIE surveys the scene.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab It's amazing, huh Jake? Your whole
\par \tab life ... right in front of you.
\par \tab \tab (she pauses before
\par \tab \tab making her final
\par \tab \tab pronouncement)
\par \tab What a mess!
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  HALLWAY - DAY
\par 
\par JEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the
\par hall. She is carrying several bags. Two of them are tossed
\par instantly down the chute. She hesitates with the third.
\par After a moment she reaches into it and pulls out a handful
\par of photos. They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH. With cool
\par deliberation she drops them down the chute. An apartment
\par door slams shut. Quickly she disposes of the pictures
\par remaining in her hand. JACOB opens the door to the tiny room
\par as the bag filled with the memories of his life falls to the
\par fire below.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Ready?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
\par 
\par JACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the
\par ELEVATOR. They are surprised that it has arrived promptly.
\par JEZZIE reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into
\par JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the ELEVATOR. They disappear,
\par laughing, behind its closing doors.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  NEW YORK CITY - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of
\par midtown Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a
\par rendition of Al Jolson's "Sonny Boy."
\par 
\par JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th
\par Street. He opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes
\par toward him. He lifts them with effort and slams the door
\par with his foot. It doesn't close. He considers giving it
\par another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns instead and
\par waddles toward the store.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  LAUNDRY - DAY
\par 
\par A heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a
\par counter cluttered with laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon
\par is still stapled to the wall. She looks at JACOB.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab Where do you expect me to put those?
\par \tab I don't have any room.
\par 
\par She tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab How 'bout over there?
\par \tab \tab (she points to a table)
\par \tab No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to
\par \tab the back room.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab They're awfully heavy.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab I know. That's why I'm asking.
\par 
\par JACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store.
\par CHINESE LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam
\par from the pressing machines shoots into the air.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (huffing and puffing)
\par \tab Where's Wong?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab That's what I'd like to know. If you
\par \tab see him on the street somewhere, tell
\par \tab him he's fired.
\par 
\par JACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a
\par snapping sound and he winces in pain. Massaging his back,
\par JACOB unfolds some papers for the WOMAN's signature.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab How was Palm Springs?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab Hot. Where do I sign?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (pointing to the line)
\par \tab You got a nice tan, though.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab Tan? What tan? It faded on the
\par \tab airplane. I'd try to get my money
\par \tab back, but who do you ask?
\par \tab \tab (she looks heavenward)
\par \tab Two hundred dollars a night, for
\par \tab what?
\par 
\par She hands JACOB the wrong sheet.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No. I'll take the other one.
\par \tab \tab (he takes it)
\par \tab Right. Well it's good to have you
\par \tab back. See you tomorrow, probably.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab If you're lucky.
\par 
\par JACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks
\par carefully. His back is out.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY
\par 
\par ANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving.
\par Horns are blaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches
\par for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags. To his shock
\par one of the bags appears to move. Curious, JACOB pokes at it.
\par Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and
\par stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps back,
\par stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is
\par looking at an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck.
\par The man's face is covered in strange bumps.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Goddamn it! What the hell ... ?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WINO
\par \tab \tab (pleading)
\par \tab I didn't take nothin'. I was just
\par \tab napping. Don't hit me. I was cold.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (lifting the man up)
\par \tab What the hell do you think you're
\par \tab doing? You can't do this. This is
\par \tab government property.
\par 
\par He begins opening the door. The WINO begs.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WINO
\par \tab Don't throw me out. They're gonna get
\par \tab me. They'll tear me to pieces.
\par 
\par He holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Come on. You can't stay here.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WINO
\par \tab Please! I never hurt anybody when I
\par \tab was alive. Believe me. I don't belong
\par \tab here.
\par 
\par JACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him
\par from the truck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars
\par and follow him as he leads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB
\par pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the
\par WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a ball and turns
\par away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB returns to
\par the truck shaking his head.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab New York!
\par 
\par He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view
\par mirror. He notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side
\par of a building. A horn honks and traffic begins moving. When
\par JACOB looks back the WINO is no longer there.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  GARAGE - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE
\par PARKING GARAGE on 34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He
\par has difficulty parking.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  POST OFFICE - DAY
\par 
\par We see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting
\par and moving mail.
\par 
\par JACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks
\par stiffly through the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back.
\par Several workers greet him and grab for his french fries. He
\par offers them around.
\par 
\par ANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in,
\par correcting mistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE
\par looks up and smiles.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Jake!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab How's it going?
\par 
\par She takes the hamburger and shrugs.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab I'm going home.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab What's wrong?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I don't know. One of these days, I'm
\par \tab gonna see Louis. My back's killing
\par \tab me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Now? What about the boss? He's not
\par \tab gonna like it.
\par 
\par JACOB shrugs.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Well, I'll miss riding home with you.
\par \tab I was looking forward to it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab I enjoy crushing into you.
\par 
\par She grabs him and hugs him tightly.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Gently. My back.
\par 
\par JEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
\par 
\par CUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTOR'S OFFICE. He is
\par lying on a long leather padded device that looks like an
\par instrument of torture. LOUIS, the Chiropractor, is a giant
\par of a man, 280 pounds. He is adjusting JACOB's spine.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab How do you know?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab I know you. How come you're so tense
\par \tab today?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What can I tell you?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab I saw Sarah the other day.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Her knee acting up?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab A bit.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What did she have to say?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Turn on your right side.
\par \tab \tab (he turns on his left)
\par \tab How about the other "right?"
\par \tab \tab (JACOB turns back)
\par \tab I don't understand you philosphers.
\par \tab You've got the whole world figured
\par \tab out but you can't remember the
\par \tab difference between right and left.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I was absent the day they taught that
\par \tab in school. What did she say?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Who?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Sarah.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Not much. She's like you that way.
\par \tab Two clams. No wonder your marriage
\par \tab didn't last. Put your hand under your
\par \tab head. Take a breath and then let it
\par \tab out.
\par 
\par He makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOB's thigh.
\par JACOB groans.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab She talk about the boys?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab She says she can't get them new coats
\par \tab because you haven't sent the alimony
\par \tab for three months.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab She told you that?
\par \tab \tab (he shakes his head)
\par \tab Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm
\par \tab still paying for the orthodontist?
\par \tab I'll bet she didn't mention that.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab She said you were a son of a bitch
\par \tab and she regrets the day she set eyes
\par \tab on you.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I thought you said she didn't say
\par \tab much.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab She didn't. That's about all she
\par \tab said. Put your hand up. Good. I think
\par \tab she still loves you. Take a breath
\par \tab and let it out.
\par 
\par He makes an adjustment. JACOB screams.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind
\par \tab word about me in years!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Right. She doesn't stop talking about
\par \tab you. You're always on her mind.
\par \tab That's love, Jake.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab She hates me, Louis.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab You should go back to her.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What? She threw me out, remember. She
\par \tab wanted some professor to carry her
\par \tab far away from Brooklyn. Only we
\par \tab didn't make it. She can't forgive me
\par \tab that she still lives in the same
\par \tab house she grew up in.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Her problem is that you spent eight
\par \tab years getting a PhD and then went to
\par \tab work for the post office.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam
\par \tab I didn't want to think anymore. I
\par \tab decided my brain was too small an
\par \tab organ to comprehend this chaos.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab \tab (looking at JACOB with
\par \tab \tab affection)
\par \tab If it was any other brain but yours,
\par \tab I might agree. Relax, this is going
\par \tab to be strong.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I can't relax.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Wiggle your toes.
\par 
\par JACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists
\par JACOB's neck rapidly. There is a loud cracking sound.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
\par 
\par THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera
\par yelling.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN
\par \tab I found one. He's alive.
\par 
\par He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and
\par halos.
\par 
\par 
\par CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
\par 
\par Suddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind
\par his head.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab God almighty. What did you do to me?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab I had to get in there. A deep
\par \tab adjustment. Rest a moment and let it
\par \tab set a bit.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I had this weird flash just then.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab What?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I don't know. I've been having them
\par \tab recently.
\par \tab \tab (he thinks a moment,
\par \tab \tab then changes the
\par \tab \tab subject)
\par \tab You know, you look like an angel,
\par \tab Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone
\par \tab ever tell you that?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No
\par \tab more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back
\par \tab won't take it. You tell your girl
\par \tab friend to calm down if she knows
\par \tab what's good for you.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Louis, you're a life saver.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab I know.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
\par 
\par JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to
\par himself and imitating Al Jolson.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab When there are gray skies, I don't
\par \tab mind the gray skies, as long as
\par \tab there's you ...
\par 
\par He hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The
\par shop windows have a particularly garish look about them. The
\par mannequins are dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry,
\par clothes and have a pathetic appearance. A few shops have set
\par up their Christmas decorations.
\par 
\par The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost
\par blasphemous.
\par 
\par JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a
\par local drug store. They chortle and make taunting sounds.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GIRL
\par \tab \tab (shaking her tits,
\par \tab \tab singing)
\par \tab "Hey, Mr. Postman ... "
\par 
\par JACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins
\par to sing with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is
\par a sweet moment.
\par 
\par JACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The
\par light is green. He is still singing to himself and does not
\par notice a BLACK CAR sharging around the corner. The car is
\par moving at full speed, heading straight toward him. A YOUNG
\par MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab YOUNG MAN
\par \tab Look out!
\par 
\par JACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but
\par it swerves in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab YOUNG MAN
\par \tab Jump!
\par 
\par With a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the
\par car shoots by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back
\par seat. They are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads.
\par They do not look human. JACOB yells and waves his fist, to
\par no effect. After a moment he turns to thank the YOUNG MAN
\par whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK
\par 
\par JACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple
\par and even in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their
\par positioning is erotic and stimulating. Both of them are
\par nude. JACOB's hands are clasped behind his neck and he is
\par staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is lying on her
\par side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head is
\par propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the
\par bayonet scar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking.
\par Suddenly, out of the blue, JEZZIE speaks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake.
\par \tab The money. Things like that. Or your
\par \tab wife.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Why do you bring her up?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab 'Cause she's always on your mind.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab When was the last time I said a word?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
\par 
\par She pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the
\par conversation is over. Then she continues.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Or maybe it's the war.
\par 
\par JACOB closes his eyes.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab It's still there, Jake.
\par \tab \tab (she points to his
\par \tab \tab brain)
\par \tab Even if you never say a word about
\par \tab it. You can't spend two years in
\par \tab Vietnam ...
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (annoyed)
\par \tab What does that have to do with
\par \tab anything? Does it explain the
\par \tab barricaded subway stations? Does it
\par \tab explain those Godforsaken creatures?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab New York is filled with creatures.
\par \tab Everywhere. And lots of stations are
\par \tab closed.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab They're like demons, Jez.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos
\par \tab and bag ladies. Low life. That's all
\par \tab they are. The streets are crawling
\par \tab with 'em. Don't make em into
\par \tab somethin' they're not.
\par \tab \tab (she rubs his forehead)
\par \tab It's the pressure, honey. That's all
\par \tab it is.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Those guys tried to kill me tonight.
\par \tab They were aiming right at me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the
\par \tab time.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab They weren't human!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Come on. What were they, Jake?
\par 
\par JACOB doesn't answer. He turns over on his stomach. JEZZIE
\par stares at his naked back and drags her fingernails down to
\par his buttocks. Scratch marks follow in their wake.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You still love me?
\par 
\par He does not respond.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table. JEZZIE
\par is reading the National Enquirer and chewing at her lip.
\par Suddenly a drop of blood forms and falls onto the formica
\par table top. Staring at it for a moment, she wipes it with her
\par finger and then licks it with her tongue.
\par 
\par JACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window
\par at the housing project across the way. The toaster pops.
\par JEZZIE jumps. She gets up, butters her toast, and returns to
\par her paper.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Says here the world's comin' to an
\par \tab end. The battle of heaven and hell
\par \tab they call it. Should be quite a show;
\par \tab fireworks, H-bombs, and everything.
\par \tab You believe them, Jake?
\par 
\par JACOB doesn't answer.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Me neither ... God, look at this. Two
\par \tab heads. Only lived two days. A day for
\par \tab each head. Could you imagine me with
\par \tab two heads? We'd probably keep each
\par \tab other up all night - arguing and
\par \tab whatnot. You wanna see the picture?
\par 
\par He does not respond. JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB.
\par Standing in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets
\par it fall apart. She is naked underneath it. Sensuously she
\par leans forward, unbuttons his shirt, and strokes his chest.
\par She waits for a response from him, but there is none. He
\par sits silently, disinterested.
\par 
\par Furious, JEZZIE turns away. Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from
\par the broom closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches
\par it on. Breasts flash from beneath her gown as the vacuum
\par roars back and forth across the floor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My
\par \tab uncle's dogs used to treat me better
\par \tab than you do. At least they'd lick my
\par \tab toes once in a while. At least they
\par \tab showed some fucking interest.
\par 
\par A NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall, shouting.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab All right! All right! All right!
\par 
\par JACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and
\par watches the patterns of early morning movement. Tiny figures
\par drift purposefully over the concrete.
\par 
\par Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. In the silence, JACOB
\par realizes that JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled
\par over the kitchen table. He walks to her side and strokes her
\par hair. JEZZIE begins to sob. After a moment she looks at him
\par with puffy eyes.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You love me?
\par 
\par He nods his head "yes." She smiles coyly and rubs her hair
\par like a kitten against his crotch. After a few moments she
\par speaks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Della's party's tonight. Why don't we
\par \tab go? It'll take your minf offa things.
\par \tab And I won't make you dance. I
\par \tab promise. Huh?
\par \tab \tab (he nods his head in
\par \tab \tab consent. JEZZIE hugs
\par \tab \tab him)
\par \tab You still love me, Jake?
\par 
\par He nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question
\par exhausts him.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB is in the "Mental Health Clinic" at BELLVUE HOSPITAL
\par walking through the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. It is
\par overflowing with people. Some are handcuffed to their
\par chairs. POLICEMEN are with them. JACOB approaches the main
\par RECEPTION DESK. He speaks nervously.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson,
\par \tab please.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab Carlson? Is he new here?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab New? He's been here for years.
\par 
\par She shrugs and looks at a log book.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab Not according to my charts. Do you
\par \tab have an appointment?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (shaking his head)
\par \tab Look, I need to see him. I know where
\par \tab his room is. Just give me a pass. I
\par \tab won't be long. Ten minutes.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab Our doctors are seen by appointment
\par \tab only.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Damn it. I was in the veteran's out-

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab \tab (not happy)
\par \tab What's your name?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Jacob Singer.
\par 
\par She walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several
\par times before coming back over to JACOB.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab I'm sorry but there's no record of a

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Whataya mean, no record?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab You want me to spell it out? There's
\par \tab nothing here.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab That's ridiculous. I've been coming
\par \tab here for years. Listen to me. I'm
\par \tab going out of my fucking mind here. I
\par \tab need to see him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab If this is an emergency we have a

\par \tab There's about an hour's wait. I'll be
\par \tab glad to take your name. Why don't you
\par \tab just fill out this form?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Goddamn it! I don't want a social
\par \tab worker. Carlson knows me.
\par 
\par JACOB pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and
\par knocking the RECEPTIONIST's forms to the floor. She grunts
\par angrily and stoops to retrieve them. Standing up her cap
\par hits a drawer handle and slips off. TWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS
\par protrude from her skull where the cap had been. JACOB's eyes
\par lock on them like radar. He backs away. She immediately
\par replaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at
\par him with demonic intensity. JACOB, freaked, angry, turns and
\par runs toward the "In Patient" door.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab RECEPTIONIST
\par \tab Hey! You can't go in there!
\par 
\par JACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs
\par after him.
\par 
\par 
\par JACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging
\par institution. A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands,
\par is moving down the hall. They break ranks as he charges by
\par and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT tries to calm them down
\par but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their hysteria.
\par They grab hold of him as he tries to get by.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab POLICEMAN
\par \tab LET GO! GET AWAY!
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  GROUP ROOM - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor,
\par wildly searching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes
\par inside. He is surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN
\par seated in a circle. They all look up at him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab Can I help you?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't
\par \tab this his office?
\par 
\par The LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he
\par gets up and takes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone
\par is watching them. The LEADER speaks quietly.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't
\par \tab ... Dr. Carlson died.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (stunned)
\par \tab Died?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab A car accident.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab Last month, before Thanksgiving.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab How did it happen?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab No one knows. They say it blew up.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (growing pale)
\par \tab Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
\par 
\par The LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but
\par he pulls away.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab Do you want me to get someone?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
\par 
\par He backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he
\par realizes that all of the PEOPLE in the group are watching
\par him intently.
\par 
\par 
\par Unsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is
\par frightened and confused. Suddenly a voice calls out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab POLICEMAN
\par \tab HEY YOU! MAILMAN!
\par 
\par JACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun
\par is drawn.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab POLICEMAN
\par \tab Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell
\par \tab do you think you are? This is
\par \tab Bellevue, for God's sake. People
\par \tab running around here get shot.
\par 
\par The GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions
\par to the POLICEMAN.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LEADER
\par \tab It's alright. He's okay.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab POLICEMAN
\par \tab \tab (nodding, reholstering
\par \tab \tab his gun)
\par \tab Come on, get out of here. I wouldn't
\par \tab want to interfere with the U.S. Mail.
\par 
\par He leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT
\par 
\par WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is
\par with some POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a
\par small apartment. A DRUNK is telling a bad joke and trying to
\par hold a glass of wine at the same time. It is constantly on
\par the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on it. In the
\par background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to
\par join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if
\par they "get it," takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of
\par confusion and keeps trying to re-explain the joke.
\par 
\par JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be
\par coming from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and
\par lifts the cover. The BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if
\par trying to get out. The sound, loud and insistent, startles
\par him. He lowers the cover.
\par 
\par In the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA,
\par an attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees
\par JACOB and calls over the music.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELSA
\par \tab Hey, you! Let me look at your hand!
\par 
\par JACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DELLA
\par \tab Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a
\par \tab book.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No, thanks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DELLA
\par \tab It's fun.
\par 
\par CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the
\par mounds and examining the lines. What begins as a playful
\par expression on her face turns suddenly serious. She reaches
\par for his other hand and compares the two of them. JEZZIE
\par looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene jealously.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELSA
\par \tab You have an unusual hand.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I could have told you that.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELSA
\par \tab You see this line here? It's your
\par \tab life line. Here's where you were
\par \tab born. And this is where you got
\par \tab married. You're a married man, huh?
\par \tab Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
\par 
\par She studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries
\par to get JACOB's attention. He ignores her.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELSA
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab You know, you got a strange line
\par \tab here.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (examining it)
\par \tab It's short, huh?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELSA
\par \tab Short? It's ended.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (laughing)
\par \tab Oh, terrific.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELSA
\par \tab It's not funny. According to this ...
\par \tab you're already dead.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (smiling)
\par \tab Just my luck.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab CUT TO:
\par 
\par THE DANCERS. Their movements are loose and getting looser.
\par The music is strong and insistent. The smokey atmosphere
\par disfigures the dancers and gives them a strange, distorted
\par appearance. Suddenly JEZZIE breaks from the crowd and
\par reaches for JACOB. He pulls away. Some of the MALE DANCERS
\par call out to him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DANCERS
\par \tab Come on man, show your stuff.
\par 
\par JACOB is easily intimidated. Relenting, he glares at JEZZIE
\par and nods apologetically to ELSA. It is obvious that he is
\par embarrassed at his inadequacy on the dance floor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN
\par \tab Come on professor. You got feet, too.
\par 
\par JACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing.
\par JEZZIE is playing with him, mimicking his movement. A number
\par of DANCERS notice and laugh, which only increases his
\par discomfort. JEZZIE's taunting has a strange effect on JACOB.
\par He grows distant and withdrawn, even though his body is
\par still going through the motions of the dance.
\par 
\par A MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder. She spins around,
\par smiling, and begins dancing with him. JACOB is left alone,
\par dancing by himself. He looks away, uncomfortable.
\par 
\par In the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor. She seems
\par to be urinating on the carpet. JACOB is shocked. Several
\par DANCERS obscure his view. He turns around.
\par 
\par A PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen. JACOB
\par cannot believe what he sees.
\par 
\par In the next room, past JEZZIE, JACOB glimpses a terrifying
\par image, a MAN whose head seems to be vibrating at such
\par enormous speed that it has lost all definition. Something
\par about the image compels and frightens JACOB. Slowly he
\par approaches it. As he draws nearer to it the tortured image
\par lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that
\par JACOB backs away.
\par 
\par A WOMAN, laughing, grabs JACOB, spins him around, and begins
\par dancing with him. He is totally disoriented.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab WOMAN
\par \tab Hold me, baby!
\par 
\par She takes JACOB's arm and guides it to her back. THE CAMERA
\par follows his hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her
\par sexy, loose fitting dress. He runs his fingers up to her
\par shoulder blades. Then, suddenly, he recoils. Her back is a
\par mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange, bony
\par protrusions. JACOB gasps. Out of the blue, JEZZIE leans into
\par him and wiggles her tongue in his ear. JACOB, startled,
\par jerks his head and his glasses go flying to the floor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Shit!
\par 
\par He stoops down blindly to pick them up. Shoes just miss his
\par fingers as he digs between dancing legs trying to recover
\par them. Miraculously, he grabs the spectacles just before they
\par are crushed and slips them back on. Instantly his world
\par comes back into focus.
\par 
\par As he stands, JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him,
\par gyrating in wild abandon. There is a huge, satisfied smile
\par on her face. She grabs his hand as if encouraging him to
\par dance but it is obvious that she is dancing to her own
\par rhythm. JACOB stares at her, confused. It takes him a moment
\par to realize that her smile is not for him.
\par 
\par Standing behind JEZZIE is another DANCER, his hands around
\par her waist. They are moving together, locked in erotic
\par embrace. It appears that he is mounting her from behind.
\par Looking down we see that the DANCER's feet are deformed.
\par They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much
\par like hooves. They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet.
\par 
\par Something horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIE's back.
\par We cannot make out what it is, but it elicits a primal
\par terror. Before JACOB can react, JEZZIE opens her mouth. With
\par a roaring sound, a spiked horn erupts from her throat. It
\par juts menacingly from between her teeth and thrusts into the
\par air. A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited approval.
\par 
\par CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He
\par stares at the DANCERS who are crowding around him. They have
\par become perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves.
\par 
\par JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision
\par from his head but it won't go away. The music throbs. His
\par actions become spastic, almost delirious.
\par 
\par JACOB is out of control. His frenzy becomes a kind of
\par exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body
\par and his mind. WE MOVE IN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond
\par pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT fade away.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
\par 
\par Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness,
\par outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a
\par cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab VOICE
\par \tab He's burning up.

\par \tab Push 'em back.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB (V.O.)
\par \tab Help me!
\par 
\par His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it
\par filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings
\par draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into
\par exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash
\par stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost sensual,
\par surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.
\par 
\par Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and
\par insistent, like a heart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies
\par the sound. The stroboscopic flashes are replaced by intense
\par flashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and
\par reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT
\par 
\par The APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy. The neon sign
\par is still flashing outside the window. DANCERS are smiling
\par and sweating.
\par 
\par Cheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB
\par barely hears them. JEZZIE hugs him tightly. PEOPLE smack him
\par on the back.

\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab That's your decision.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Look at me. I'm ice cold.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You're red hot, damn it. Get in
\par \tab there. I've got to get more ice.
\par 
\par She runs out of the room. The door to the apartment slams
\par shut. JACOB sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out
\par again instantly.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Oh Jesus!
\par 
\par He sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice
\par cold water turns his foot bright red. He keeps it in as long
\par as he can and then yanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a
\par towel. JACOB rubs his foot vigorously to get rid of the
\par sting and stares at the water, afraid of its pain.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT
\par 
\par JEZZIE is running up and down the CORRIDOR knocking on doors
\par and collecting ice cubes from those who will answer. She
\par hurries back to the BATHROOM with several PEOPLE behind her
\par carrying additional ice trays. One of the MEN is shifting
\par the trays in his hands to avoid the burning cold.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S BATHROOM
\par 
\par As JEZZIE enters the BATHROOM, JACOB is sitting on the rim
\par of the tub with the water up to his calves, shivering
\par vigorously.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I can't do it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab What kind of man are you?
\par 
\par She unloads two trays into the water.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Don't gimme that.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Lie down!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (pleading)
\par \tab Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!

\par \tab \tab (calling out)
\par \tab Sam, Tony, come in here.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Hey, I'm not dressed.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SAM
\par \tab You got nothin' we ain't seen before.
\par 
\par SAM and TONY grab hold of JACOB who wrestles to get away.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Get the hell off me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab TONY
\par \tab He's like a hot coal.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SAM
\par \tab It's for your own good, Jake.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Let go of me, you sons of bitches.
\par 
\par The TWO MEN struggle with JACOB and force him into the
\par water. TONY winces when the water hits his arm. JACOB nearly
\par flies out of the tub. The TWO MEN fight to hold him down.
\par JACOB screams and cries for the MEN to let him go but they
\par keep him flat on his back.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab I'm freezing! I'm freezing! Goddamn
\par \tab you!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab TONY
\par \tab \tab (his hand turning red)
\par \tab Sam, I can't take it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SAM
\par \tab Don't you let go.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab TONY

\par \tab Help me! Help me!

\par \tab \tab (to TONY)
\par \tab Here. I'll do it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab TONY
\par \tab Take his legs.

\par \tab Bring it in.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MRS. CARMICHAEL
\par \tab Is he all right?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab He doesn't like it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MRS. CARMICHAEL
\par \tab I don't blame him. What should I do
\par \tab with the ice?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Pour it in.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MRS. CARMICHAEL
\par \tab On top of him?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab He's melting it as fast as we dump it
\par \tab in.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MRS. CARMICHAEL
\par \tab Okay. My husband's got two more bags.
\par \tab He's coming. They're heavy.
\par 
\par TONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Oh God! You're killing me! Stop!
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT
\par 
\par CUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He
\par is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to
\par get out. Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window.
\par It is open and the shade is flapping. Cold air is blowing in
\par and he is shivering.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Damn! You and your fresh air.
\par 
\par He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes
\par at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A
\par woman in the bed sits up. It is SARAH.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab What was that?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It's freezing.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab I'm not cold.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Of course not. You have all the
\par \tab blankets. It must be ten degrees in
\par \tab here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you
\par \tab want to sleep with fresh air, you
\par \tab sleep on the fire escape. From now on
\par \tab that window is closed.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab It's not healthy with it closed.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab This is healthy? I'll probably die of
\par \tab pneumonia tomorrow and this is
\par \tab healthy.
\par 
\par He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to
\par his side. He lies quietly for a moment, thinking.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab What a dream I was having. I was
\par \tab living with another woman ... You
\par \tab know who it was?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab I don't want to know.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Jezebel, from the post office. You
\par \tab remember, you met her that time at
\par \tab the Christmas party. I was living
\par \tab with her. God, it was a nightmare.
\par \tab There were all these demons and I was
\par \tab on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab Guilty thoughts. See what happens
\par \tab when you cheat on me, even in your
\par \tab mind?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab She was good in bed, though.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab Go to sleep.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab She had these real beefy thighs.
\par \tab Delicious.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab I thought you said it was a
\par \tab nightmare?
\par 
\par Suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a
\par music box. A YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical
\par LUNCH BOX in his arms. He is wearing a long T-shirt nearly
\par down to his ankles. We recognize him from his photograph. It
\par is GABE.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab Daddy, what was that noise?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (surprised to see him)
\par \tab Gabe?
\par \tab \tab (he stares curiously at
\par \tab \tab his son)
\par \tab What are you doing ... ?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab There was a bang.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It was the window.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab It's cold.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Tell your mother.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab Mom, it's ...
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab I heard you. Go back to sleep.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab Will you tuck me in?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SARAH
\par \tab \tab (not happily)
\par \tab Oh ... all right.
\par 
\par She starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He
\par whisks GABE upside down and carries him into his
\par 
\par 
\par GABE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
\par 
\par BEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way.
\par GABE laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits
\par the bed. JED, 9, and ELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across
\par the room. JED looks up.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JED
\par \tab Dad?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Jed. It's the middle of the night.
\par \tab \tab (he kisses GABE and goes
\par \tab \tab over to JED in the lower
\par \tab \tab bunk)
\par \tab What's up?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JED
\par \tab You forgot my allowance.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Your allowance? It's five A.M. We'll
\par \tab talk at breakfast.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JED
\par \tab Okay, but don't forget.
\par 
\par Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ELI
\par \tab I love you, Dad.
\par 
\par JACOB smiles.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What is this, a convention? I love
\par \tab you, too, Pickles. Now go back to
\par \tab sleep.
\par 
\par He turns to leave.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab Wait ... Daddy.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Now what?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab Don't go.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Don't go?
\par \tab \tab (he smiles)
\par \tab I'm not going anywhere. I'm right
\par \tab here, Gabe.
\par \tab \tab (he looks at his son
\par \tab \tab tenderly)
\par \tab Come on, go back to sleep. You can
\par \tab still get a couple of hours.
\par 
\par He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab ... I love you.
\par 
\par There is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB
\par is struck by them.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Don't shut the door.
\par 
\par JACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab A bit more ... a bit more.
\par 
\par JACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him
\par secure. GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets
\par comfortable. JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He
\par pulls the blankets up to his neck. He is overcome with
\par feelings of sadness and longing.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I love you, Sarah.
\par 
\par She smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds
\par he is back asleep.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN
\par 
\par WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image
\par of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky,
\par just before sunrise, can be seen through the branches. It is
\par an idyllic setting.
\par 
\par Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a
\par metallic humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of
\par feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall
\par grass. Voices can be heard. Men's voices.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab VOICE
\par \tab They're here.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab VOICE
\par \tab Thank God. Move 'em out!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab VOICES
\par \tab Bust your balls!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab VOICE
\par \tab Move it! Move it!
\par 
\par There is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches
\par blur and speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments
\par before reveals itself as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out
\par of a JUNGLE covering and into a huge CLEARING.
\par 
\par High overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a
\par deafening whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle
\par in mid-air. SOLDIERS leap up into the air reaching for them.
\par The air is filled with turbulence. Tarps fly off dead
\par bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices yell but the words
\par are not clear. They are filled with urgency.
\par 
\par The CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear
\par as the helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows
\par larger and darker as the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and
\par insignias dotting the underbelly come into view. Suddenly
\par the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. Hands emerge
\par from inside, reaching out to grab it.
\par 
\par Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling
\par of water, a heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard
\par mumbling; distant sounds, warm and familiar.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub.
\par Surprisingly JEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there
\par too. JACOB stares at them in total confusion.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOCTOR
\par \tab You are a lucky man, my friend. A
\par \tab lucky man. You must have friends in
\par \tab high places, that's all I can say.
\par 
\par SAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending
\par their hands to the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue,
\par reach out to them.
\par 
\par Slowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one
\par step onto the tile and collapses to the floor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab CUT TO BLACK:
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY
\par 
\par FADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass
\par rattles on a tray. A television is on low in the background.
\par Slowly the CAMERA LENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see
\par JEZZIE puttering around the BEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware
\par that JACOB is watching her. She smiles.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Jake.
\par \tab \tab (she places her hand on
\par \tab \tab his head and strokes his
\par \tab \tab hair)
\par \tab You're gonna be all right, Jake.
\par \tab You're gonna be fine.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Am I home?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You're here. Home. The doctor said
\par \tab you're lucky your brains didn't boil.
\par \tab \tab (she smiles)
\par \tab What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You
\par \tab kept sayin' "Sarah, close the
\par \tab window," over and over. And talkin'
\par \tab to your kids. Even the dead one.
\par \tab Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds
\par \tab of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Are we in Brooklyn?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You're right here, Jake. You just
\par \tab rest.
\par \tab \tab (she puffs up his
\par \tab \tab pillow)
\par \tab The doctor said you had a virus.
\par \tab That's what they say when they don't
\par \tab know what it is. You can't do
\par \tab anything for a week. He says you
\par \tab gotta recuperate.
\par \tab \tab (she strokes his
\par \tab \tab forehead, and gets up)
\par \tab Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman
\par \tab made you some chicken soup. It'll
\par \tab warm you up.
\par 
\par JEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He
\par seems lost and confused.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the
\par KITCHEN TABLE. PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out
\par before him. He studies them to distraction. JEZZIE is
\par standing by the counter making sandwiches. She wraps them in
\par plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another in the
\par refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You know, you really ought to get out
\par \tab today. You can't just sit around like
\par \tab this all the time. It's not healthy.
\par \tab It's not good for your mind. Go take
\par \tab a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie.
\par \tab Christ, who's gonna know? You think I
\par \tab care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy
\par \tab yourself. One of us should be having
\par \tab a good time.
\par \tab \tab (JEZZIE knocks on
\par \tab \tab JACOB's head)
\par \tab Hello! Anybody home?
\par \tab \tab (she looks in his ear)
\par \tab Anybody in there?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What?
\par 
\par JEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB
\par returns to his books.
\par 
\par CUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with
\par spindly horns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger,
\par magnified, scans page after page of ancient images and
\par archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of attention,
\par returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Goddamn it! I can't stand it anymore.
\par \tab I've had it up to here. Go ahead and
\par \tab rot if you want ... You son-of-a-
\par \tab bitch, I'm talking to you.
\par 
\par CUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches
\par JACOB's attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He
\par looks up to see JEZZIE knocking pots and pans off the
\par kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room. The
\par noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is shocking.
\par The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books
\par onto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops.
\par 
\par JEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich,
\par stuffs it back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in
\par her lunch box. She is about to leave when she stops and
\par looks at JACOB.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing, her anger
\par \tab \tab in check)
\par \tab I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's
\par \tab in the fridge. Eat a carrot with it.
\par \tab The aspirin's on the bottom shelf.
\par \tab We're out of soap so, if for some
\par \tab reason you decide to wash yourself
\par \tab again, use the dishwashing stuff.
\par \tab \tab (she walks out of the
\par \tab \tab room and returns with
\par \tab \tab her coat)
\par \tab I'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my
\par \tab nerves.
\par \tab \tab (she bends down and
\par \tab \tab makes eye contact with
\par \tab \tab JACOB)
\par \tab Hello? Listen, I gotta go.
\par 
\par JEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then,
\par unexpectedly, raises two fingers, like horns, over her head.
\par The gesture catches JACOB's full attention.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.
\par \tab \tab (she kisses his cheek)
\par \tab Love me a little?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (speaking with
\par \tab \tab affection)
\par \tab You are the most unbelievable woman I
\par \tab have ever met. One second you're a
\par \tab screaming banshee and the next you're
\par \tab Florence Nightingale. Who are you?
\par \tab That's what I want to know. Will the
\par \tab real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
\par 
\par Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles them.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Oh shit. Tell 'em I've left.
\par 
\par JEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside
\par down. A pocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB
\par smiles. JEZZIE curses as she struggles to pick it up and get
\par the jacket on right. JACOB gets the phone.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Hello.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL (V.O.)

\par \tab Paul Gruneger!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be
\par \tab goddamned!
\par 
\par JACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss
\par goodbye and hurries out the door.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the
\par \tab hell are you? I haven't seen you in
\par \tab what, five, six, years?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL (V.O.)
\par \tab A long time.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's
\par \tab happening in your life?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL (V.O.)
\par \tab Nothin' much.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So
\par \tab tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL (V.O.)
\par \tab I need to see you, Jake.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But
\par \tab I'm kind of laid up here. I've been
\par \tab sick.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL (V.O.)
\par \tab I need to see you.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  PAUL'S CAR - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading
\par toward WILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them.
\par JACOB pats PAUL on the back.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Jesus, man, you look terrific. You
\par \tab must have put on twenty pounds.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab I work in a bakery.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab You're lucky. How many vets you know
\par \tab are even employed?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Count 'em on one hand.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn
\par \tab war. I'm still fightin' it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It's not worth it. You'll never win.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab You tellin' me? How many times can
\par \tab you die, huh?
\par 
\par PAUL looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes. He
\par sees a black car tagging close behind him. He pulls out. So
\par does the car.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Still married, Jake?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Nope.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab You and everybody else. God I hate

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Why the hell we drivin' here?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab I just need to talk.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab You can't talk in Brownsville?
\par

\par \tab I'm not sure where I can talk
\par \tab anymore.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What's wrong?

\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Let's get a couple drinks, okay?
\par \tab \tab (he looks at his rear
\par \tab \tab view mirror)
\par \tab Hey, take a look behind us. Do you
\par \tab think that car is followin' us?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (turning to look)
\par \tab That black car?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Pull the mirror down on the sun
\par \tab visor.
\par \tab \tab (JACOB does)
\par \tab Just watch 'em.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What's goin' on Paul?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab I don't know.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab You in trouble?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Yeah.
\par 
\par JACOB notices PAUL's left arm. It is shaking. The black car
\par passes on the left. Both PAUL and JACOB stare at it as it
\par speeds by.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  BAR - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and PAUL are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure
\par WILLIAMSBURG BAR. It is nearly empty. PAUL is leaning across
\par the table in a very intimate fashion.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Somethin's wrong, Jake. I don't know
\par \tab what it is but I can't talk to
\par \tab anybody about it. I figured I could
\par \tab with you. You always used to listen,
\par \tab you know?
\par 
\par JACOB nods. PAUL takes a sip of his drink and stares
\par deliberately into JACOB's eyes.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab I'm going to Hell!
\par 
\par JACOB's face grows suddenly tense.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab That's as straight as I can put it.
\par \tab And don't tell me that I'm crazy
\par \tab 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to
\par \tab Hell. They're comin' after me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (frightened, but holding
\par \tab \tab back)
\par \tab Who is?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab They've been followin' me. They're
\par \tab comin' outta the walls. I don't trust
\par \tab anyone. I'm not even sure I trust
\par \tab you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm
\par \tab gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
\par 
\par PAUL cannot contain his fear. He jumps up suddenly and walks
\par away from the booth. JACOB follows him with his eyes but
\par does not go after him. A YOUNG MAN in the next booth
\par observes the scene with interest. He looks vaguely familiar,
\par like we have seen him before.
\par 
\par PAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over
\par to the juke box. He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and
\par drops it in the slot. His finger pushes a selection at
\par random. Some '60's rock hit blares out. JACOB's mind is
\par reeling by the time PAUL sits back down.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just
\par \tab gonna jump outta my skin. They're
\par \tab just drivin' me wild.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab I don't know who they are, or what
\par \tab they are. But they're gonna get me
\par \tab and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I
\par \tab can't do anything. I can't go to my
\par \tab sisters. I can't even go home.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Why not?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab They're waitin' for me, that's why.
\par 
\par PAUL's hand starts to shake. The tremor spreads rapidly to
\par his whole body. The booth begins to rattle.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab I can't stop it. I try. Oh God! Help
\par \tab me Jake.
\par 
\par JACOB slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves
\par in toward PAUL. He puts his arm around him and holds him
\par tightly, offering comfort as best he can.
\par 
\par PAUL is obviously terrified and grateful for JACOB's
\par gesture. A few PEOPLE at the bar look over in their
\par direction.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (crying)
\par \tab I don't know what to do.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Don't do anything.
\par \tab \tab (PAUL begins to relax a
\par \tab \tab bit and the shaking
\par \tab \tab subsides)
\par \tab Paul, I know what you're talking
\par \tab about.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab What do you mean?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I've seen them too ... the demons!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab \tab (staring at JACOB)
\par \tab You've seen them?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Everywhere, like a plague.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab God almighty. I thought I was the
\par \tab only one.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I
\par \tab was coming apart at the seams.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Oh God. I know. I know.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What is it Paul? What's happening to
\par \tab me?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab They keep telling me I'm already
\par \tab dead, that they're gonna tear me
\par \tab apart, piece by piece, and throw me
\par \tab into the fire.
\par \tab \tab (he fumbles in his coat
\par \tab \tab pocket and pulls out a
\par \tab \tab small Bible and silver
\par \tab \tab cross)
\par \tab I carry these everywhere but they
\par \tab don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone
\par \tab thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a
\par \tab report with the army.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (stunned)
\par \tab The army?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab She said I haven't been the same
\par \tab since then. Since that night. There's
\par \tab still this big hole in my brain. It's
\par \tab so dark in there, Jake. And these
\par \tab creatures. It's like they're crawling
\par \tab out of my brain. What happened that
\par \tab night? Why won't they tell us?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I don't know. I don't know.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab They're monsters, Jake. We're both
\par \tab seein' 'em. There's gotta be a
\par \tab connection. Something.
\par 
\par JACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG
\par MAN in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY
\par 
\par PAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the
\par urinal.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I
\par \tab keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come
\par \tab up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a
\par \tab guy can't even take a leak by
\par \tab himself. I've seen 'em take people
\par \tab right off the street. I used to go
\par \tab home a different way every night. Now
\par \tab I can't even go home.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab You come home with me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab What about your girlfriend? You don't
\par \tab think she'll mind?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Are you kidding? We've put up more of
\par \tab her cousins. You wouldn't believe how
\par \tab they breed down there.
\par 
\par PAUL smiles.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  BAR - DAY
\par 
\par The TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold
\par outside. Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the
\par bar's front window. PAUL looks at them and smiles.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Merry Christmas.
\par 
\par PAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of
\par his car. He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB
\par looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Goddamn, this is my lucky day.
\par 
\par He bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the
\par ignition and steps on the gas. He turns the key.
\par 
\par THE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the
\par air. JACOB sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris
\par hurls above him. He covers his head.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  VIETNAM
\par 
\par CUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is
\par exploding all around it and the shock waves are rocking the
\par craft violently. JACOB's eyes peer to the left.
\par 
\par INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A
\par pair of MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of
\par arterial bleeding sends a stream of blood splattering over
\par the inside of the windshield. The PILOT, unable to see,
\par clears it away with his hands.
\par 
\par JACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the
\par MEDICS presses his ear close to JACOB to hear.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Help me!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MEDIC
\par \tab We're doing the best we can.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Get me out of here!
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  BAR - DAY
\par 
\par THE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and
\par drags him down the sidewalk.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab YOUNG MAN
\par \tab Just hold on.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Where am I? Who are you?
\par 
\par The YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another
\par explosion consumes the car. The air is filled with flames
\par and flying debris. The YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab YOUNG MAN
\par \tab Just lie still. You're okay. You're
\par \tab not hurt.
\par 
\par The CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has
\par blown apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross
\par from around PAUL's neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are
\par heard in the distance. A BLACK CAR speeds off down the
\par street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had helped him. He
\par is gone.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY
\par 
\par A FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are
\par dressed up. JACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad
\par over his ear. They drive in silence. JACOB appears very sad.
\par Slowly his right hand reaches across the seat, seeking
\par JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
\par 
\par The FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along
\par the length of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from
\par their cars along with WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.
\par 
\par They are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the
\par film, only they are older now. A small group of FAMILY
\par MEMBERS are helped to the graveside.
\par 
\par JACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry
\par the casket in semi-military formation to the grave.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  PAUL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB'S OLD ARMY BUDDIES are sitting together in Paul's
\par living room, talking. PAUL'S WIFE can be seen in the
\par BEDROOM. Several WOMEN are comforting her.
\par 
\par JEZZIE is talking to a small group of LADIES in the DINING
\par ROOM and nibbling off a tray of cold cuts. PAUL'S SISTER is
\par with her and they seem to be having a lively, almost
\par intimate, conversation.
\par 
\par JACOB and his BUDDIES are drinking beer. They all have a
\par tired, defeated look about them.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab FRANK
\par \tab Did anyone see the police report? It
\par \tab sounds like a detonation job to me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab The paper said it was electrical; a
\par \tab freak accident.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Bullshit. Someone's covering
\par \tab somethin'. That was no accident.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab Why do you say that?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Cars don't explode that way. Any
\par \tab simpleton knows that.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab But the paper ...
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab That was set. I'm tellin' you.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab By who? Why? Paul didn't have an
\par \tab enemy in the world.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab How do you know?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd
\par \tab want to hurt him?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab FRANK
\par \tab What did he talk about when you guys
\par \tab went out? Did he say anything?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab He was upset. He thought people were
\par \tab following him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab You're kidding. Who?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab He didn't know ... Demons.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab \tab (obviously struck by the
\par \tab \tab word)
\par \tab What do you mean, demons?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab He told me he was going to Hell.
\par 
\par The statement has a surprising impact on the group. There is
\par immediate silence and eyes averted from one another.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab What'd he say that for? What made him
\par \tab say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab What else did he say, Jake?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab He was scared. He saw these creatures
\par \tab coming out of the woodwork. They were
\par \tab tryin' to get him, he said.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab \tab (his arm shaking)
\par \tab How long had that been going on?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab A couple of weeks, I think.
\par 
\par He notices GEORGE's beer can rattling.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab He say what they looked like?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No. Not really ...
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab Excuse me a minute. I'll be right
\par \tab back.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab In one end, out the other, huh
\par \tab George?
\par 
\par GEORGE tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom. His arm
\par is nearly out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet
\par as he walks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Still a spastic, huh? I hope you can
\par \tab hold your dick better than you hold
\par \tab that can.
\par 
\par No one laughs. There is an uncomfortable silence.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  A BACK ALLEY - DAY
\par 
\par The SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It
\par is already gray and getting darker.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab I know what Paul was talking about. I
\par \tab don't know how to say this ... but in
\par \tab a way it's a relief knowing that
\par \tab someone else saw them, too.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab You're seeing ... ?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab They're not human, I'll tell you
\par \tab that. A car tried to run over me the
\par \tab other day. It was aiming straight for
\par \tab me. I saw their faces. They weren't
\par \tab from Brooklyn.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab What are you tellin' me? They're from
\par \tab the Bronx?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab It was no joke, Rod.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab Something weird is going on here.
\par \tab What is it about us? Even in Nam it
\par \tab was always weird. Are we all crazy or
\par \tab something?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab Yeah, ever since that ...
\par 
\par He hesitates. They all understand.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab What's that have to do with anything?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab FRANK
\par \tab It was bad grass. That's all it was.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab Grass never did that to me.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab You know, I've been to three shrinks
\par \tab and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates
\par \tab that night. Nothing.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab It's not worth goin' over again and
\par \tab again. Whatever happened, happened.
\par \tab It's over.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab ... I've seen them, too.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Shit!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab So have I.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Look, there's something fucking
\par \tab strange going on here. You know
\par \tab Paul's not the only one who's died.
\par \tab You remember Dr. Carlson over at
\par \tab Bellevue? His car blew up, too.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Dr. Carlson's dead?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab An explosion, just like Paul's.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab No!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab FRANK
\par \tab Jesus!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEORGE
\par \tab You think they're connected?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (he nods)
\par \tab I think something's fucking connect-
\par \tab ed. I mean, a car tried to run me
\par \tab over the other day. Doug too, right?
\par \tab We've got six guys here going fucking
\par \tab crazy.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Not me, buddy.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us
\par \tab are flipping out for some goddamn
\par \tab reason. They're tryin' to kill us.
\par \tab Fuck it man, we need to find out
\par \tab what's going on.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab Do you think it has something to do
\par \tab with ... the offensive?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It's got something to do with some-
\par \tab thing. I think we've got to confront
\par \tab the army. If they're hiding shit from
\par \tab us, we better find out what it is.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Come on, Professor. The army's not
\par \tab gonna give you any answers. You'll be
\par \tab buttin' your head against a stone
\par \tab wall.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Maybe that's the only way to get
\par \tab through. Besides, six heads'll be
\par \tab better than one.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm
\par \tab gettin' a headache just listenin' to
\par \tab you.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab We should get ourselves a lawyer.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab I say you should get a shrink.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab Too late. I've tried. I think you're
\par \tab right, Jake. I'm game.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JERRY
\par \tab Me, too.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab You guys are fucking paranoid. It was
\par \tab bad grass. That's all it was. There's
\par \tab no such thing as demons.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  LAW OFFICE - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on
\par plush chairs in the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a
\par red-faced man with three chins, is sucking on an ice cube.
\par He looks at each of the men, and then spits the ice cube
\par into an empty glass. It clinks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you
\par \tab have any idea how many people come to
\par \tab me with the injustices of the world?
\par \tab It'd break your heart.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The
\par \tab army did something to us and we've
\par \tab got to find out what.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab The army. The army. What is it with
\par \tab you guys? We're not talking about a
\par \tab trip to the library here. This is the
\par \tab United States Government for God's
\par \tab sake. This is red tape coming out of
\par \tab your ass. You know what I mean?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Exactly. And we need someone to cut
\par \tab through it. We hear you're the man.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason
\par \tab here?
\par 
\par GEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file
\par drawer. He chomps down a few and offers the bag to the
\par others. There are no takers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube
\par and cracks it between his teeth.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Okay. I'll look into it.
\par 
\par The MEN are surprised and excited.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab PAUL
\par \tab Wow! Do you think we have a chance?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab What do you want, a fortune teller or
\par \tab a lawyer? ... I'll need sworn
\par \tab depositions from each of you and a
\par \tab list of the other members of the
\par \tab platoon, or their survivors.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOUG
\par \tab Hey, this is great.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab I'll tell you, if we find the
\par \tab military is implicated in any way,
\par \tab you could stand to recover quite a
\par \tab lot of money. Not that I can predict
\par \tab anything, but some class action suits
\par \tab of this kind have been awarded fairly
\par \tab generous judgements. That wouldn't be
\par \tab so bad, would it Mr. Singer?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Doctor.
\par \tab \tab (GEARY looks at him
\par \tab \tab oddly)
\par \tab Ph.D.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I am.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab \tab (confused)
\par \tab Then why aren't you teaching? Why
\par \tab aren't you in a university?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I'm too messed up to teach.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab \tab (smiling)
\par \tab Ah! Well then, they're going to have
\par \tab to pay for that, aren't they?
\par 
\par The MEN all nod in agreement.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are
\par jubilant, clasping hands and smacking each other on the
\par back. We watch as they break up. JACOB heads for the subway.
\par FRANK and another group hop a cab. As the cab pulls away we
\par notice that a black car pulls out behind it. It follows them
\par out of sight.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on
\par the kitchen floor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand
\par splashes into the dog's bowl. Nothing impedes their passion.
\par JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and swoons. Hands grab hold of table
\par legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly against the stove. It
\par is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends.
\par 
\par JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply
\par basks in JEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and
\par radiant. They lie exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum
\par floor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab So tell me ... am I still an angel?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (smiling broadly)
\par \tab With wings. You transport me, you
\par \tab know that? You carry me away.
\par 
\par JEZZIE kisses him softly around his face and gently probes
\par his ear with her pinky. JACOB loves it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab We're all angels, you know ...

\par \tab You know what? I feel ... exorcised

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab How come? The army?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab In a way. At least now I have some

\par JACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe.
\par JEZZIE is moving rapidly around the KITCHEN.

\par \tab What's he talking about?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab I don't know. That's all he said. He

\par \tab I don't believe this.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd

\par

\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab FRANK
\par \tab Don't bother to call again, okay?
\par 
\par FRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long
\par time, until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds
\par him it's off the hook. The sound frightens him and he slams
\par the receiver down. QUickly JACOB tears through his address
\par book looking for other phone numbers. They aren't there.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Shit!
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  JACOB'S APT.
\par 
\par JACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box
\par from the closet. The box is filled with yellowing army
\par papers, dog tags, and photos of old comrades. Beneath his
\par discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names
\par and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs it. Then his
\par eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks
\par it up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written
\par in a child's handwriting. "DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE
\par COME HOME. JED GOT A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO

\par 
\par GABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is
\par running alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic
\par streamers trail from the handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly,
\par but determined. After a couple of false starts, JACOB lets
\par go and GABE is riding by himself. For an instant, GABE looks
\par back at his father with a huge grin on his face. JACOB is

\par 
\par JACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter.
\par Suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full
\par length mirror mounted on the bedroom door. Something in the
\par mirror, like the image of a child, seems to move. He looks
\par over. There is nothing there. Curious, JACOB walks toward
\par the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops moving.
\par To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected
\par in the mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him.
\par He lifts his hand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened
\par but defiant, JACOB moves toward the mirror. The image in the
\par mirror spins around. It is the  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE
\par he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An unearthly scream comes
\par from both their mouths.

\par 
\par 
\par INT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
\par 
\par A huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it.
\par 
\par He is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded
\par court house corridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is
\par cradling a Coke in one hand, a sandwich and a briefcase in
\par the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he walks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it!

\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Take your hands off me!

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Listen, will you listen? They're

\par 
\par GEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab There's nothing I can do.
\par 
\par He turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and
\par then rushes after him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich.
\par 
\par Mayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his
\par tongue. JACOB catches up to him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab You mind? I'm eating, huh?
\par

\par \tab I don't know you from Adam, right?
\par \tab You come to my office with this

\par \tab it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Used you?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab I talked to the Army's Bureau of
\par \tab Records. You've never even been to
\par \tab Viet Nam.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What the hell is that supposed to
\par \tab mean?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab It means that you and your buddies

\par \tab on psychological grounds after some
\par \tab war games in Thailand.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (stunned)
\par \tab War games? Thailand? That's not true!
\par \tab How can you believe that? Can't you
\par \tab see what they're doing? It's all a

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GEARY
\par \tab I don't have to do any such thing.
\par \tab I'm eating my lunch, okay?
\par 
\par GEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away.
\par JACOB, enraged, charges after him. With a wild swipe he
\par sends the COKE CAN shooting out of GEARY's hand. It
\par reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece
\par \tab of shit!
\par 
\par With a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's
\par other hand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in
\par it. Tomato and mayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB
\par turns away.
\par 
\par 
\par CUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the
\par elevators. There is a look of satisfaction on his face.

\par The Muzak is playing "Sonny Boy" with Al Jolson singing.
\par JACOB is surprised to hear it. He presses the down button
\par for the main floor.
\par 
\par 
\par The elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly.
\par SEVERAL SOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB.

\par INT.  CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
\par 
\par JACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in
\par between two officious looking MEN. The doors lock from the

\par \tab \tab \tab ARMY OFFICIAL #1
\par \tab Mr. Singer. What an appropriate name

\par \tab You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ARMY OFFICIAL #2
\par \tab I hope we have made our point, Mr.
\par \tab Singer.
\par 
\par JACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally
\par berserk. Letting out a howl, he begins pounding and
\par thrashing like a madman. He is totally out of control.
\par 
\par With a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door
\par flies open. It flaps back and forth, slamming into parked
\par cars. JACOB tries to jump out, but the men yank him back in.
\par One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB sees it and goes crazy.
\par His feet kick in all directions, slamming the DRIVER's nose
\par into the steering wheel and shattering the side window.
\par 
\par The car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to
\par the floor. The men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat.
\par In the mayhem, JACOB throws himself out of the flapping door
\par and sprawls onto the pavement. People look down at him as
\par the car speeds away.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON
\par 
\par JACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries
\par to get up, but can't move. He reaches out to people passing
\par by, but they ignore him and hurry past.
\par 
\par A SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene.

\par 
\par 
\par INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless
\par series of corridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a
\par hypnotic regularity. The smooth tile floor gives way to
\par roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet plod through pools of blood
\par that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way. The
\par surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body parts
\par and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves
\par faster.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Where are you taking me? Where am I?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ORDERLY
\par \tab You know where you are.
\par 
\par JACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He
\par glances to the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led
\par into dark rooms. No one fights or struggles. We hear muffled
\par screams from behind closed doors. Occasionally he glances
\par inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange
\par contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from
\par metal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a
\par baseboard heater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned.
\par A door opens. A bicycle with plastic streamers on the
\par handlebars lies crushed and mangled. One of its wheels is
\par still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is not his voice we
\par hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His whole body
\par stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head
\par vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has
\par seen before. JACOB screams.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  ROOM - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of "DOCTORS" are
\par waiting. As they draw closer JACOB notices that something
\par about them is not right. They bear a subtle resemblance to
\par Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of another world. JACOB tries
\par to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot move. He tries to
\par scream but no sound comes out.
\par 
\par Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered
\par and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and
\par legs. He screams.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Oh God!
\par 
\par The "DOCTORS" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door
\par closing. JACOB is left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new
\par group of "DOCTORS" emerges from the shadows. They are
\par carrying sharp surgical instruments. They surround JACOB,
\par their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB is
\par panting and sweating in fear. One of the "DOCTORS" leans
\par over JACOB. He gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab JEZZIE!
\par 
\par She pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA
\par TILTING DOWN HER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a
\par decaying mass, swarming with maggots. The "DOCTORS" laugh.
\par They take great pleasure in his suffering. Their voices are
\par strange and not human. Each utterance contains a multitude
\par of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting
\par and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a
\par torment of its own.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)

\par \tab There is no out of here. You've been

\par 
\par A "DOCTOR" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with
\par horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a
\par long needle from his belt and positions it over JACOB's
\par head. Like a divining rod it locates a particular point near
\par the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the "DOCTOR"
\par shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly
\par into his brain. JACOB howls.

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Good God, Jake. What have they done?
\par \tab \tab (he examines JACOB and
\par \tab \tab screams at the NURSES)
\par \tab What is this, the Middle Ages? And

\par \tab is barbaric! Barbaric!
\par \tab \tab (turning to JACOB)
\par \tab It's okay, Jake. It's not serious.
\par \tab I'll get you out of here.
\par \tab \tab (yelling at the ORDERLY)
\par \tab What is this, the Inquisition? Why
\par \tab don't you just burn him at the stake
\par \tab and put him out of his misery?
\par 
\par LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins
\par working the pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The

\par 
\par LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that,
\par compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He
\par pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position.
\par JACOB leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal
\par position. Every moment is agony for him.

\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Half an hour from now and you'll be

\par \tab Well, you've done it to yourself this

\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab \tab (smiling)
\par \tab From a slipped disc? That'd be a

\par \tab Well, I'll see what I can do about

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I've seen it. It's all pain.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab \tab (working on JACOB's
\par \tab \tab spine like a master
\par \tab \tab mechanic)
\par \tab You ever read Meister Eckart?
\par \tab \tab (JACOB shakes his head
\par \tab \tab "no")
\par \tab How did you ever get your Doctorate
\par \tab without reading Eckart?
\par \tab \tab (LOUIS takes hold of
\par \tab \tab JACOB's legs and yanks
\par \tab \tab them swiftly)
\par \tab Good. Okay, let's turn over gently.
\par \tab Right side.
\par 
\par JACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab The other "right," okay?
\par \tab \tab (he helps JACOB turn
\par \tab \tab over)
\par \tab You're a regular basket case, you
\par \tab know that?
\par \tab \tab (he moves JACOB's arm
\par \tab \tab over his head)
\par \tab Eckart saw Hell, too.
\par 
\par LOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then
\par pushes down on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking
\par sound. JACOB groans.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab You know what he said? The only thing
\par \tab that burns in Hell is the part of you
\par \tab that won't let go of your life; your
\par \tab memories, your attachments. They burn
\par \tab 'em all away. But they're not punish-
\par \tab ing you, he said. They're freeing
\par \tab your soul. Okay, other side.
\par 
\par He helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the
\par spine cracks.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if
\par \tab you're frightened of dying and hold-
\par \tab ing on, you'll see devils tearing
\par \tab your life away. But if you've made
\par \tab your peace then the devils are really
\par \tab angels freeing you from the earth.
\par \tab It's just a matter of how you look at
\par \tab it, that's all. So don't worry, okay?
\par \tab Relax. Wiggle your toes.

\par JACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected
\par jab to the lower vertebrae in his back.

\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Perfect. We got it.
\par \tab \tab (LOUIS pushes a lever

\par \tab You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just
\par \tab give it a try.
\par 
\par JACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves
\par hesitantly, with deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him
\par like a faith healer coaxing the lame. His first steps have
\par an aura of the miraculous about them. JACOB walks slowly,
\par without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like a giant
\par cherub.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS
\par \tab Hallelujah.
\par 
\par LOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again,

\par Police cars and mobile units rush to the scene.
\par 
\par CUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit
\par torch. In the other he is holding a container of gasoline

\par and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon
\par container lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it
\par insistently and pours onto the street. Bystanders back away
\par as the gasoline snakes toward them.
\par 
\par Television cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's

\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Listen to me. There were four

\par \tab Are you getting all this? I want this

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What the fuck do you think you're

\par of them throws another match. Crazed, JACOB runs toward
\par them. PEOPLE jump back.
\par 
\par Suddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees
\par one of the ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is
\par reaching for a gun. JACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis
\par lungs.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab NO!
\par 
\par With a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the
\par air. We see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and
\par higher. All eyes stare upward watching it in a kind of
\par wonder. Then, reaching its apex, just below the camera, it
\par begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd turn to fear.
\par SOMEONE yells.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ONLOOKER
\par \tab He'll burn us all!
\par 
\par Screams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the
\par potential conflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless,
\par standing silently, almost heroically, in the middle of it
\par all.
\par 
\par Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline
\par ignites with a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in
\par all directions. PEOPLE panic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN
\par run for their lives. The ARMY OFFICIALS run, too. The flames
\par travel toward the Army Headquarters and rush along the curb.
\par Water hoses are trying to douse them as they spread. JACOB,
\par surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through the
\par frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the
\par flames the scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.

\par drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase from the BEDROOM closet,
\par and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries back to the
\par shower, tests it, and jumps in.
\par 
\par Lather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed
\par eyes. His entire body is covered in suds. He is washing as
\par quickly as he can. Suddenly he hears a noise as someone
\par enters the BATHROOM. He tenses.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB

\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Goddamn it! Who's there?
\par 
\par JACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower

\par seen on the screen. We hear the NEWSCASTER speaking.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab NEWSCASTER
\par \tab Leading the news tonight, a bizarre
\par \tab demonstration on the steps of the
\par \tab U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in
\par \tab downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an
\par \tab alleged Vietnam vet ...
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Alleged? Alleged?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab NEWSCASTER
\par \tab ... challenged the United States Army
\par \tab to admit conducting secret experi-
\par \tab ments involving hundreds of American
\par \tab soldiers during the Vietnam war.
\par 
\par JEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his
\par suitcase and hurries to the front door. He opens it a crack
\par and peers into the hallway. JEZZIE runs after him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (almost threatening)
\par \tab Don't leave me, Jake.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the
\par HALL. He stops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is
\par still standing there. She is very angry. JACOB just stares
\par at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN
\par in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at
\par JACOB with curiosity. One MAN in particular cruises by
\par several times and then approaches him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.
\par \tab Friends call me Mike.
\par 
\par JACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN
\par who has appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in
\par moments of crisis.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know
\par \tab me. I've been tracking you for a long
\par \tab time. I just wish I'd spoken to you
\par \tab before tonight.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I don't get it. Who are you? Why have
\par \tab you been following me?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Observation, mainly. Clinical study.
\par \tab You were one of the survivors.
\par 
\par A POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs
\par JACOB's shoulder and turns him away nervously.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Come on, we're not safe around here.
\par 
\par 
\par HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER
\par that juts into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he
\par listens to MICHAEL's story.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab So first I'm arrested, right? Best
\par \tab LSD I ever made, right down the
\par \tab drain. I figure this is it, twenty
\par \tab years in the joint, if I'm lucky.
\par \tab That was '68.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Long time ago.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (nodding his head)
\par \tab Next thing I know I'm on Rikers
\par \tab Island. Ever been there?
\par \tab \tab (JACOB shakes his head)
\par \tab Suddenly they take me from my cell to
\par \tab the visitors room with those bank
\par \tab teller windows, you know. Four army
\par \tab colonels, medals up their asses, are
\par \tab standing on the other side. They tell
\par \tab me if I'll come to Vietnam for two
\par \tab years, no action, mind you, just work
\par \tab in a lab, they'll drop all the
\par \tab charges and wipe the record clean.
\par \tab Well, I'd only been in jail for
\par \tab thirteen hours and I already knew
\par \tab that Nam couldn't be any worse.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Shows how much you knew.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab No shit. They had me by the balls.
\par \tab Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ...
\par \tab in a secret lab synthesizing mind-
\par \tab altering drugs. Not the street stuff
\par \tab mind you. They had us isolating
\par \tab special properties. The dark side,
\par \tab you know? They wanted a drug that
\par \tab increased aggressive tendencies.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Right. They were worried. They
\par \tab figured you guys were too soft. They
\par \tab wanted something to stir you up, tap
\par \tab into your anger, you know? And we did
\par \tab it. The most powerful thing I ever
\par \tab saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my
\par \tab share, never compared to the fury of
\par \tab the Ladder.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab The Ladder?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab That's what they called it. A fast
\par \tab trip right down the ladder.
\par \tab \tab (he makes a downward
\par \tab \tab dive with his hand)
\par \tab Right to the primal fear, the base
\par \tab anger. I'm tellin' you, it was
\par \tab powerful stuff. But I don't need to
\par \tab tell you. You know.
\par 
\par JACOB can barely catch his breath, the information he is
\par receiving is so powerful to his mind.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab We did experiments on jungle monkeys.
\par \tab They bashed each other's heads in,
\par \tab gouged out their eyes, chewed off
\par \tab their tails. The brass loved it. Then
\par \tab they made us try it on Charlie.
\par \tab \tab (he pauses)
\par \tab They took these POW's, just kids
\par \tab really, and put 'em in a courtyard.
\par \tab We fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.
\par \tab \tab (he stops for a moment;
\par \tab \tab a tear rolls down his
\par \tab \tab cheek)
\par \tab They were worse than the monkeys. I
\par \tab never knew men could do such things.
\par \tab The whole thing still blows me away.
\par 
\par MICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the
\par PIER. JACOB, astounded, gets up and walks beside him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Anyway, this big offensive was coming
\par \tab up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine,
\par \tab Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was
\par \tab scared 'cause they knew we couldn't
\par \tab win. Morale was down. It was gettin'
\par \tab ugly in the States. Hell, you
\par \tab remember.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Like it was yesterday.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab A couple days later they decided to
\par \tab use the Ladder, on one test
\par \tab battalion. Yours. Just in an
\par \tab infintessimal dose in the food
\par \tab supply, to prove its effectiveness in
\par \tab the field. They were sure your unit
\par \tab would have the highest kill ratio in
\par \tab the whole goddamn offensive. And you
\par \tab did, too. But not the way they
\par \tab tnought.
\par 
\par JACOB is beginning to shake. MICHAEL pulls a container of
\par pills out of his jacket pocket.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Hey, want something to calm you down?
\par \tab Made 'em myself.
\par 
\par JACOB shakes his head no.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab None of us can remember that night. I
\par \tab get flashes of it but they don't make
\par \tab sense. We saw shrinks for years. But
\par \tab nothing they did could ever touch it.
\par \tab What happened? Was there ever an
\par \tab offensive?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab A couple of days later. It was
\par \tab fierce. You guys never saw it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab But there was an attack. I can still
\par \tab see them coming. There was a fight,
\par \tab wasn't there?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Yeah. But not with the Cong.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Who then?
\par 
\par He hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy.
\par He looks at the river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab You killed each other.
\par 
\par JACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
\par 
\par Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam.
\par JACOB is at the bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK.
\par Chaos surrounds them. Men are screaming. The ENEMY is
\par storming at them from the rear. ROD raises his bayonet and
\par jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only after a
\par series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's
\par killed. ROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab ROD
\par \tab Oh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
\par 
\par JACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of
\par AMERICAN SOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up,
\par knocking JACOB to the ground and slamming his rifle into
\par JACOB's back. As he spins around JACOB sees another SOLDIER
\par charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at JACOB's stomach.
\par For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his attacker.
\par He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing
\par glasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible
\par confusion. It seems like a moment out of time. And then the
\par SOLDIER lurches forward and rams his bayonet deep into
\par JACOB's abdomen.
\par 
\par CUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab It was brother against brother. No
\par \tab discrimination. You tore each other
\par \tab to pieces. I knew it would happen. I
\par \tab warned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was
\par \tab just a hippie chemist, right? Jesus!
\par \tab And I helped 'em make the stuff ... I
\par \tab talked to the guys who bagged the
\par \tab bodies. They're in worse shape than
\par \tab you, believe me. They saw what was
\par \tab left. It's a blessing you don't
\par \tab remember. Of course the brass covered
\par \tab the whole thing up right away. Blamed
\par \tab it all on a surprise attack.
\par \tab \tab he pauses)
\par \tab I needed to find you. The Ladder was
\par \tab my baby.
\par 
\par Tears start flowing down MICHAEL's face. He wipes them with
\par his sleeve. It takes him a moment to regain his composure.
\par JACOB is shivering. MICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it
\par over JACOB, and leads him to the wooden planks overhanging
\par the water. They sit and gaze at the JERSEY SHORE.
\par 
\par 
\par CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab I always suspected the effects might
\par \tab come back. That's why I had to follow
\par \tab you. I had a hell of a time getting
\par \tab hold of your records.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab If you knew, why didn't you say
\par \tab anything?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab The truth can kill, my friend. Five
\par \tab hundred men died out there. This
\par \tab isn't a story they'd ever want out.
\par \tab When Paul's car blew up I realized
\par \tab the scope of the thing. I knew they
\par \tab meant business.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab So why tell me now?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Because I can get rid of the demons.
\par \tab I can block the Ladder. I have an
\par \tab antidote. We can kill them off,
\par \tab chemically speaking. They'll all
\par \tab disappear. It's chemistry, my friend.
\par \tab I know. I created it. Come with me. I
\par \tab can help.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  HOTEL - DAWM
\par 
\par JACOB and MICHAEL enter a sleazy HOTEL near the docks,
\par obviously frequented by a gay clientele. JACOB is
\par uncomfortable as they check in. MICHAEL, however, seems to
\par know the ropes. They go to a small room.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab You come here often?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Sometimes. When it's convenient.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab How do I know this isn't just some
\par \tab kind of, you know, seduction or
\par \tab something?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got
\par \tab bigger problems than me.
\par 
\par MICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a
\par vial.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab I came up with the formula back in
\par \tab Nam but I never got a chance to use
\par \tab it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Never?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just
\par \tab open your mouth and stick out your
\par \tab tongue.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What is it?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your
\par \tab head. Come on.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (fearful)
\par \tab I don't know.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab "Yea though I walk through the valley
\par \tab of the shadow of death I shall fear
\par \tab no evil," but no one ever said I
\par \tab wouldn't be shittin' in my pants
\par \tab every step of the way, huh?
\par \tab \tab (JACOB smiles, his mouth
\par \tab \tab open)
\par \tab Stick out your tongue.
\par \tab \tab (JACOB obeys as an
\par \tab \tab eyedropper deposits a
\par \tab \tab drop of liquid on the
\par \tab \tab back of his tongue)
\par \tab That'a boy. Now why don't you just
\par \tab lie down and relax.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab One drop?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab It's strong stuff.
\par 
\par JACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling
\par and examines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and
\par shallow craters erode the surface. It is an alien terrain.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I think I'm falling asleep.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Pleasant dreams.
\par 
\par The words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get
\par up but can't. He's frightened.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I can't move.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Just relax.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What's happening? Help me.
\par 
\par The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge
\par crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is
\par crumbling. He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to
\par surge through the rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp
\par teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws
\par clamor to break through.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab HELP ME!
\par 
\par Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding
\par the vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of
\par the fluid and holds it over JACOB's mouth.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Take it!
\par 
\par JACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of
\par the eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit
\par it out, but can't.
\par 
\par Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole
\par chunks break off and collide like continental plates. The
\par collisons wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and
\par dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a
\par Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Don't fight it. It's your own mind.
\par \tab It's your own fears.
\par 
\par Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head,
\par thundering like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw
\par power and growing catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage
\par until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's eyes stare into
\par the formlessness expanding around him. All space is becoming
\par a dark liquid void.
\par 
\par Gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an
\par undulating sense to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like
\par comfort. Strange lights appear and sparkle before us like
\par sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing upward, toward the
\par surface.
\par 
\par With the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB
\par breaks through. To his amazement, he finds himself floating
\par out-stretched on shimmering sunlit water. Above him are
\par clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be
\par of the earth. Pillars of golden light reach down from the
\par heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a vision of
\par heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed.
\par 
\par A sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and
\par sees MICHAEL standing before him. Only MICHAEL looks
\par different. His face seems to radiate an inner light, a
\par transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly blinded by his
\par presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab So, how you doin'?
\par 
\par The casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He
\par sits up. To his shock and amazement, he finds that he is
\par back in THE HOTEL ROOM. MICHAEL is standing at the foot of
\par the bed. JACOB is totally disoriented. His eyes move slowly
\par around the room, taking everything in. He doesn't speak.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab It was better than you expected, huh?
\par 
\par JACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly
\par begins to laugh. It is a huge laugh, full of energy and
\par life.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab And no more demons. I told you they'd
\par \tab be gone.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I don't believe this. It's a miracle,
\par \tab Michael. A miracle.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Better living through chemistry,
\par \tab that's my motto.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF
\par GREENWICH VILLAGE. It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are
\par bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB stares into their faces and
\par beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys JACOB's
\par happiness.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab It was paradise, Michael. You showed

\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Well that's good to know.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed
\par \tab you enough of that stuff to send a
\par \tab horse to heaven. I'm just glad you
\par \tab came back.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I would have stayed there if I could.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab I'm sure. You've got nothing but

\par He points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.

\par \tab \tab (taking JACOB's arm)
\par \tab Come on.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY
\par 
\par The TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of
\par the GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL
\par pulls out a huge stack of credit cards and hands one to
\par JACOB.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Here. I've got every credit card ever
\par \tab printed. Take this. Stay here till

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No. I couldn't.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab What? You want the Plaza? Don't be
\par \tab foolish. Here. Take this, too.
\par \tab \tab (he pulls out a business
\par \tab \tab card)
\par \tab This is my place on Prince Street.
\par \tab It's got my phone, everything. Call
\par \tab if you need me ... but you won't.
\par \tab Everything's gonna work out. You just
\par \tab get outta town as fast as you can.
\par \tab The New York police can be effective
\par \tab when they want to be.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I don't know what to say.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MICHAEL
\par \tab Save the words ... Just send back my
\par \tab credit card.
\par 
\par MICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE.
\par He is sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock
\par at the door. He jumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing
\par there. She looks at JACOB quizzically. He smiles and takes
\par her in his arms, swinging her into the room.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab What are you doing here? Are you all
\par \tab right? How do you expect to pay for
\par \tab this?
\par \tab \tab (JACOB smiles)
\par \tab Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I
\par \tab dodged people all over the place,

\par \tab you're gonna do.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I'm gonna make love to you. That's

\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE

\par \tab What's gotten into you?
\par 
\par JACOB grins.
\par 
\par CUT TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in bed gently caressing one
\par another. For all his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the
\par events of the preceding day. While stroking JEZZIE's hair he
\par begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on top of him and
\par shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles.
\par 
\par DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love.

\par

\par \tab It's amazing, you know, that a drug

\par 
\par JACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB

\par seem as happy as could be.

\par INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the
\par PEOPLE around him. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the
\par TICKET WINDOW he gets in line. The TICKET SELLER looks up.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Chicago. One way. For tomorrow.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SELLER
\par \tab How many?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab One.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab SELLER
\par \tab That'll be $119.75.
\par 
\par JACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it
\par up. While he is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at
\par him. The stare unsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his
\par ticket. He takes it and hurries into the CROWD. Looking back
\par he notices the POLICEMAN is following him.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the
\par stalsls, drops his pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on
\par the walls and then notices a wad of tissue stuffed into a
\par hole between him and the next stall. It is moving. Suddenly
\par the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the hole
\par curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to
\par see an eye staring back at him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Goddamn it!
\par \tab \tab (he covers it with his
\par \tab \tab hand. A pencil jabs his
\par \tab \tab palm. He yells)
\par \tab Fucking pervert.
\par 
\par Two lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab VOICE
\par \tab Dream on!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (shocked)
\par \tab What?!
\par 
\par The mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and
\par feet running from the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants.
\par He dashes out of the MEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and
\par chases after them.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
\par 
\par JACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing
\par toward the main doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE,
\par huddling along the corridors, watch as they run past.
\par Escaping to the street, the MAN disappears in the holiday
\par throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for breath. His fists
\par dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something and
\par seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands.
\par

\par 
\par 
\par INT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING
\par 
\par JACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a
\par dingy, industrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door
\par with MICHAEL's name painted on it in large black letters. He
\par knocks loudly. There is no answer. He pounds on it. Another
\par door opens on the floor above. A head sticks out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN

\par \tab \tab (panting hard)
\par \tab Where is he?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN
\par \tab Don't know. Hasn't picked his mail up
\par \tab in days. It's not like him.
\par 
\par JACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around
\par the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner.
\par He grabs a two-by-four and lunges at the door.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN
\par \tab What the hell are you doing?
\par 
\par JACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until
\par the lock flies open.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING
\par 
\par JACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He
\par finds it. The LOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing.
\par JACOB runs from room to room. In the back he discovers a
\par large private chemistry lab. Glass vials and bottles are
\par shattered on the floor.
\par 
\par JACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact
\par but their labels mean nothing to him.
\par 
\par He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid
\par oozing out from the bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed
\par head stares him in the face. It is smiling.
\par 
\par A scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB
\par has seen. JACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's
\par headless body. It is lying sprawled across the floor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab MAN
\par \tab Oh my God!
\par 
\par JACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of
\par unrelieved panic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the
\par doorr. He takes two and three stairs at a time, nearly
\par flying to the street.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the
\par sidewalk as fast as his legs will move. With unexpected
\par violence he charges into the side of a building. Over and
\par over he hurls himself against it. He grabs for the bricks.
\par His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is as
\par though he is trying to merge with the wall.
\par 
\par Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is
\par speeding toward him, its lights the only sign of life and
\par warmth in the dark night. JACOB steps into its path. It is
\par hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to
\par be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB stares at it a
\par moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to pull
\par off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  TAXI - NIGHT
\par 
\par Rain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (barely audible)
\par \tab I'm going to Brooklyn.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DRIVER
\par \tab Sorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I
\par \tab get lost in Brooklyn.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab I know the way.
\par 
\par JACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty
\par dollar bill, and hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Look, this is all the money I've got
\par \tab in the world. Take me home and it's
\par \tab yours.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DRIVER
\par \tab ... Where's your home?
\par 
\par CUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY, approaching the
\par BROOKLYN BRIDGE, crossing the EAST RIVER, and driving
\par through dark BROOKLYN STREETS.
\par 
\par JACOB's face passes in and out of dense shadows. Every time
\par he is bathed in light his image seems to alter. Something in
\par him is falling away.
\par 
\par 
\par EXT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of
\par SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab DOORMAN
\par \tab Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
\par

\par \tab \tab (greeting him warmly)

\par \tab Do you want some help? I can call

\par \tab No, don't. But thanks.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
\par 
\par JACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his
\par hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes
\par back with a key. He inserts it into the lock and gently
\par opens the door. He calls out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Hello. It's me.
\par 
\par 
\par INT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
\par 
\par Some lights are on. The APARTMENT looks comfortable and
\par cozy.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Hello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli?
\par \tab Daddy's here.
\par 
\par There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He peers into
\par the dark LIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN. No one
\par is around. A photo of JACOB, SARAH, AND THEIR BOYS is
\par sitting on the counter. He picks it up and carries it with
\par him through the apartment. He walks into his old BEDROOM and
\par then into the BOYS' ROOM. The beds are still unmade. There
\par is no one home. He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and
\par turns away in disgust. He walks back to the LIVING ROOM. He
\par is about to switch the lights on when he hears footsteps
\par coming down the hall. He calls out.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't
\par \tab mind. I needed to come home.
\par 
\par JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not
\par seem he usual self. She appears larger, more imposing.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here
\par \tab in the end.
\par 
\par JACOB is nervous.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What're you ... ? Where's Sarah?
\par \tab Where are the boys?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Sit down, Jake.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Where are they?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Sit down.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab No! What's going on? Where's my
\par \tab family?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab It's over, Jake. It's all over.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Where have they gone?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Wake up. Stop playing with yourself.
\par \tab It's finished.
\par 
\par JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare.
\par The edge of her coat rustles and flutters as she moves
\par toward him. It is an innocent sound at first, but after a
\par moment it transforms into something else, an obsessive
\par flapping noise, the sound of a wing.
\par 
\par JACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His
\par legs are shaking.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab What's going on?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab Your capacity for self-delusion is
\par \tab remarkable, Dr. Singer.
\par 
\par JEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she
\par talks to him. Something about her walk is very unnatural.
\par JACOB eyes her fearfully.
\par 
\par In the darkness JEZZIE's movements become increasingly
\par strange and elusive. We see her pass before a shadow and
\par disappear within it, only to reappear, seconds later, in a
\par doorway on the other side of the room. JACOB spins around,
\par confused. Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face, although
\par it seems like there has been no time for her to get there.
\par Her movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all
\par physical laws.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab What's wrong, Jake?
\par \tab \tab (she mocks him)
\par \tab Forget to take your antidote?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Who are you? What are you doing to me?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved

\par \tab Ladder. What an imagination you have!
\par 
\par JACOB freezes.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab And your vision of paradise ...
\par \tab fantastic! You're a real dreamer, you
\par \tab know that? Only it's time to wake up.
\par 
\par JEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room. Only the
\par sounds of flapping wings remain. They grow louder and more
\par menacing, whooshing past him with no visible source.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Your mind is crumbling, Jake. No more
\par \tab "army." No more conspiracies. You're
\par \tab dying, Dr. Singer. It's over.
\par 
\par JACOB, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out.
\par "JEZZIE" laughs.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Where's to run, Jacob? Where's to go?
\par 
\par JACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror
\par behind him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab WHO ARE YOU?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab How many times have you asked me
\par \tab that? How many times?
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JEZZIE
\par \tab \tab (with consummate power)
\par \tab YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
\par 
\par JEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures
\par her and it seems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to
\par JACOB's horror, she turns around. He is staring at the
\par vibrating creature he has seen so often before. Glimpsed
\par almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and
\par undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in
\par constant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry,
\par the essence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it,
\par overhwelmed by confusion. He is rooted in fear.
\par 
\par A sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing
\par JACOB's hair straight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him
\par into the wall. He can barely stand. He struggles to pull
\par himself away. The flapping sound returns, charging at him
\par from all directions. It is as if the darkness itself is
\par swooping down, trying to envelop him.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (whispering to himself)
\par \tab This isn't happening.
\par 
\par New terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the
\par air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with
\par unrelenting anger. Guns fire and explode past his head. It
\par is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on
\par him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the melee.
\par Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.
\par 
\par Suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as
\par if from a distance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear
\par him. He stands motionless.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab LOUIS (V.O.)
\par \tab If you're frightened of dying you'll
\par \tab see devils tearing you apart. If
\par \tab you've made your peace then they're
\par \tab angels freeing you from the world.
\par 
\par The voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to
\par do. And then the sounds return. Only now they are more
\par terrifying than ever. Hideously loud, they become a
\par cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the
\par sounds of battle, fighting, and dying.
\par 
\par JACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the
\par room. All the sounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB
\par stares at it the louder they become. After a moment, JACOB
\par takes a huge breath. We sense a great resolve forming inside
\par him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it.
\par 
\par NEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to
\par drive him back, but he will not be stopped. He continues
\par walking toward the creature.
\par 
\par In the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor.
\par It rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a
\par maddening hypnotic regularity. Doors slam open and closed,
\par unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force. The
\par room itself seems like an organic presence. It is alive,
\par angry, and threatening.
\par 
\par The CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the
\par source of madness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates
\par with unstoppable fury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting,
\par continues to approach it.
\par 
\par AS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the
\par density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen. It is
\par like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness.
\par 
\par With superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It
\par is like grabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins
\par shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted. He is
\par flying in all directions but does not let go. His fingers
\par claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles defiantly with
\par the monster.
\par 
\par Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab CREATURE
\par \tab WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING!
\par 
\par JACOB does not respond. It cries out again.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab CREATURE
\par \tab WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
\par \tab FIGHTING?
\par 
\par Deep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the
\par presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking
\par before us. It looks briefly like an animal until we realize
\par it is the image of a human face. It is covered by a dark
\par suffocating film, like a mask.
\par 
\par JACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \tab CUT TO:
\par 
\par DEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him
\par from beneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw
\par him on the battlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is
\par pale and lifeless. It takes JACOB a moment to realize that
\par he is dead. The recognition is one of terrible confusion and
\par pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry
\par wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating
\par sadness.
\par 
\par As that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a
\par flash of catacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's
\par life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his
\par adulthood. The demons, the room, JEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL,
\par SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding
\par intensity.
\par 
\par We are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a
\par constantly changing field of images. Some of the images
\par move, some of the people in them speak. They are not
\par particularly significant memories, in some ways they are
\par quite banal, but something about them is infused with life
\par and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force.
\par Some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent
\par with JACOB. Some we have not seen before. There is no order
\par to them, no logic to why they have been recalled.
\par 
\par A newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH
\par pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's
\par FATHER stands in the Florida surf as sea foam laps gently at
\par his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play cards on the edge of a
\par rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of an oncoming
\par car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal,
\par listening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway
\par lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH
\par slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks
\par at JACOB and asks "Love me a little?"
\par 
\par And then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a
\par wonderful soothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked
\par to find himself sitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment.
\par He is all alone. The first rays of early morning sunlight
\par are filtering through the window. Something about the
\par apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits
\par motionless, stunned to be back there.
\par 
\par The faint sound of music can be heard coming from the
\par hallway. It is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music
\par box. JACOB listens to it for a few moments and then
\par something registers inside him. Curious, he gets up and
\par approaches the corridor.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab Hello?
\par 
\par There is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB
\par freezes for a moment. He sees someone standing in the
\par shadows at the other end.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Who is it? Who's there?
\par 
\par Tentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he
\par begins to see the outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden,
\par he realizes who it is. His eyes well up as he stands there,
\par the full impact of the moment registering inside him. It's
\par his son, GABE. He is carrying the same musical lunch box we
\par have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at his father.
\par It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Gabe? Gabe!
\par 
\par JACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he
\par embraces him in a rush of love and emotion.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab JACOB
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab Gabe. Oh God. I don't believe ...
\par 
\par They hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits
\par down on the stiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around
\par his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity
\par and compassion. We sense for an instant that their roles
\par have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand and gently
\par encourages him to stand up.
\par 
\par With a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps.
\par 
\par Sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting
\par the first landing. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB
\par reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting
\par light.
\par 
\par GABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to
\par follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring
\par in from above. Squinting, he cannot see his son. Then
\par suddenly GABE steps back out of the light and takes his
\par father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with excitement.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab Come on Dad ... You know what we've
\par \tab got? A sandbox just like the
\par \tab Williston's, only it's bigger and the

\par \tab it.
\par 
\par JACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment
\par of total euphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the
\par stairs.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab GABE
\par \tab \tab (continuing)
\par \tab And my parakeet. Remember, the one
\par \tab grandma let out of the cage? He's
\par \tab okay. And he's talking now. He knows
\par \tab my name.
\par 
\par GABE's voice slowly trails off as he and his father
\par disappear in the intenstity of the light. THE CAMERA HOLDS
\par on the image. For a brief but stunning moment there appears
\par to be a huge ethereal staircase shimmering before us. It
\par rises up into infinite dimensions. Then the brilliance of
\par its blinding light overwhelms the screen.
\par 
\par Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light
\par source. It holds for a second and then flashes off. An
\par overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view.
\par

\par INT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY
\par 
\par A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his
