\par 
\par 
\par More than half of these pieces were syndicated in a number of American
\par newspapers by The Central Press Association of New York. Several others
\par of them originally appeared in _The Bookman_. "Literary Lives" has been
\par amplified since it was written for the New York _Times_ as a review of
\par the "Dictionary of National Biography," Second Supplement, Volumes II
\par and III. "Only She Was There" and "Former Tenant of His Room" are
\par reprinted from the New York _Evening Post_. "The Sexless Camera" was
\par contributed to a magazine called _The International_. "I Know an Editor"
\par was written at the invitation of a gentleman whose name I cannot recall,
\par and whether or not he ever used it in whatever publication it was with
\par which he was connected I do not know.
\par 
\par I thank all these friends of mine for permitting me to here reprint

\par TURNS ABOUT TOWN
\par 
\par CHAPTER I
\par 
\par THE HOTEL GUEST
\par 
\par 
\par Some people just go to a hotel (sometimes referred to as "an hotel") and
\par stay awhile and go away again. And think nothing about the matter.
\par 
\par Of course, some may complain more or less at the place about the
\par "service." Or swank round outside about the address, saying carelessly:
\par "Oh! yes: at the Blackstone, you know." Or again, if it's a rather
\par inexpensive place, remark to friends: "Isn't it a funny hole! But the
\par cuisine is excellent. You'd be surprised! That's why I stop there. And
\par then it's much more homey, too, than those garish places."
\par 
\par Now I myself am a fan for hotels.
\par 
\par If I was a rich man I'd do like an aristocratic and restless young man I
\par know, who used to go to one New York hotel about twelve at night (after
\par the evening's entertainment) and leave a call for ten in the morning,
\par when he would get up and drive to another hotel, check in, eat lunch and
\par dinner there, and move on to a third New York hotel that night. A
\par cheerful way he had of adding variety to his life.
\par 
\par He was a highly agreeable youth, this chap. Always "wore" a
\par silver-headed cane. I'm sorry to have to say that he is now in jail.
\par Yep! You see, he had many attractive qualities, but dependability was
\par not a feature of his equipment. However, his is a resilient nature, and,
\par fortunately, he is an epicure by temperament. I was rather distressed,
\par myself, when I heard that he was in jail; and other of his friends that
\par I met also were decidedly disturbed about him. One day one of them got a
\par letter from him (it was in France, you know, that he was then in jail),
\par a bubbling, delightful letter (just like the youth), in which he
\par declared with much gusto that the jail he was in had the best menu of
\par any jail in France.
\par 
\par But about hotels. Oh, yes!
\par 
\par I always like those huge, brown-paper laundry bags they have hanging up,
\par pressed beautifully flat, in the rooms, closets or bathrooms of hotels.
\par You can't roll up your laundry all in one wad and thrust it into one of
\par these bags, because this would tear the bag. The way to do is to put in,
\par for instance, first your collars, then, say, your sox, follow perhaps
\par with your shirts, and so on. In hotels of the very first water, you have
\par observed, a neat little pocket is attached to the outside of the bag,
\par into which you have the fun of pinning your laundry slip, all
\par elaborately made out.
\par 
\par Next thing, of course, is to get your laundry started on its way. And
\par here come up a view of the nice nuances of hotels. You gotta watch your
\par Ps and Qs in these matters or you're likely to get a black-eye at your
\par hotel. All right in a modest sort of place just to holler down the
\par telephone for a boy. Then you say to boy, waving hand toward objects:
\par "Laundry to go down, suit to be pressed, hat to be ironed, shoes to be
\par polished, letters to be mailed," and so forth. Boy gathers up
\par miscellaneous collection of articles and proceeds upon these divers
\par assignments. Presto! Nothing further to detain you.
\par 
\par But suppose you have gone in for a little more class in the matter of
\par your hotel--Statler, or something like that. Then you find much more of
\par a ritual to life. To accomplish your existence requires thought, a clear
\par head--and time. You pay the penalty of the dignity of pomp and
\par circumstance. No large, off-hand, free and easy manner about sending up
\par a boy. The "operator" knows nothing of boys. In the matter of your
\par laundry you may request her to connect you with the "bell captain,"
\par through whose agency (but not otherwise) a boy may be procured. One
\par message. In the matter of your suit you may request to be connected with
\par the "valet service." Message two. And so on.
\par 
\par Then you sit you down and await the procession. Or, if you prefer,
\par contemplate the spectacle of life by looking out at the window.
\par 
\par You fee Buttons. Lapse of time.
\par 
\par Boots (as Dickens calls him) arrives--what probably here is a
\par porter--for shoes. Then you have an excellent opportunity (which may not
\par occur again during the day) for a slight period of philosophical
\par meditation, or to whistle a tune, before the valet appears.
\par 
\par In such places as I am describing it is not etiquette at all (though it
\par may seem to you the simplest way of doing the thing) to call a bellboy
\par to get down your bag. The porter does that--and through the correct
\par channel, that is by way of the freight elevator. And, say, something
\par goes wrong with your ice-water pipe. You are not to outrage hotel
\par decency here. What is necessary for you to procure is a waiter. Waiters
\par attend to your inner wants.
\par 
\par I like best the character of valet when he is English (either so by
\par birth, or this by self-cultivation); wears a skirt coat, immaculately
\par pressed, and a "buttonhole"; advances into the room in the attitude of a
\par bow, and comes to a pause in the pose of one listening with deep and
\par profoundly respectful attention to the haughty utterance of a stage
\par earl. Though, indeed, there is an element of disquiet in your being thus
\par elevated to the Peerage if, as with me, the suit you turn over to this
\par unexceptionable servitor is of Hirt, Snuffler and Muss manufacture, and
\par growing a trifle frail in the seat.
\par 
\par The same thing is true of bath-rooms. I don't, of course, mean that
\par bath-rooms perform the valet act. But that the more aristocratic in
\par hotels you get the more likely you are, so to say, to get into hot water
\par in bath-rooms. Like this:
\par 
\par If you get into a bathtub which is not quite the last word in bathtubs,
\par that is a bathtub which has legs and spigots to turn on the water, you
\par know where you are at all the while. You turn on the hot water in the
\par amount desired. It comes out of the hot water spout. As desired you turn
\par on the cold water. Out of the cold water spout comes it.
\par 
\par But, as you know, the last word in bathtubs is not simple and democratic
\par like that. It is built onto the floor and has a clock-like dial on the
\par wall. Dial marked at different points: "Cold," "Medium," "Hot," "Off."
\par Turn little handle to regulate temperature and flow of water. All out of
\par same pipe. Yes--but--dial untruthful--very. "Off" scalds you; "Medium"
\par freezes you. Bad time trying to take last word in baths.
\par 
\par "Tub or shower?" Maybe you say "shower." And draw one of those
\par police-court cells. Except the door, no opening in the little, square,
\par completely cement room but the small hole in the center of the floor
\par through which the water runs away. But that's not the way to look at it.
\par These little catacomb-like chambers are \'e6sthetic in their ascetic
\par character. You may entertain yourself by fancying that you are St.
\par Jerome, or somebody like that. In here nothing that it will hurt can
\par get wet, and you can have a fine time making the whole room a
\par merry-go-round of splashes. One disturbing thought may occur to you. If
\par the door should stick you might not be found until the hotel got worried
\par about your bill, when perhaps it would be too late.
\par 
\par Still, I think the chummiest bath-rooms are those with a bay-window;
\par very reprehensible those which have no hooks on which to hang your
\par pajamas and razor strop.
\par 
\par Then there are those hotels so far-seeing into the possibilities of evil
\par chance and so solicitous of your equanimity that they provide your pin
\par cushion with one suspender button. I suppose the thought is to impress
\par you with the idea that nothing for your comfort, even down to the
\par smallest detail, is forgotten. Still, though I do not know that such an
\par untoward incident ever happened, it is within the range of human
\par possibility that a man might be shorn of two suspender buttons at once.
\par If, further, the hotel management were co-ordinated with the gentlemen's
\par underwear business a safety pin would be served along with the suspender
\par button--in view of the singular fact that, until your wife has taken a
\par reef in them, all nether garments are much too great in girth for any
\par figure at all approximating normal.
\par 
\par Working, however, as it does, with human material no hotel can get away
\par with perfection. For, as Dr. Johnson observed, "a fallible being will
\par fail somewhere." It was in San Francisco recently that three days were
\par required for me to recover a suit sent in the morning to be pressed by
\par that afternoon. This mischance was occasioned by three circumstances. To
\par wit: goblins (presumably) made away with the ticket attached to it; the
\par hotel tailor fell indisposed with (I hope) leprosy; and his assistant
\par had a slight mental infirmity, in other words he was seven times an
\par idiot.
\par 
\par Reverse English in Los Angeles a few days later. When one night I found
\par neatly hung on the coat frame in my closet a suit of excellent material,
\par of fashionable design, and seemingly of virgin character. I reported the
\par matter to the third assistant manager. One criticism only I have to make
\par of that suit. It was too confoundedly tight.
\par 
\par Then, of course, even at the best places (I almost think particularly in
\par the best places) you are likely any time to find under your door in the
\par morning a telephone message stamped "Rush," directing you to call
\par so-and-so "as soon as possible"--and dated 5:17-1/2 two days earlier.
\par Or, on coming in you are handed by the clerk a memorandum which states
\par that Mr. Cohan telephoned. Such matters, you reflect, are retrogressive.
\par If you are unacquainted with any gentleman of the name of Mr. Cohan, so
\par it may very well be that the guest here who is a friend of Mr. Cohan
\par received notice that _your_ friend Mr. Sloan telephoned. And there you
\par are!
\par 
\par My friend Harry Heartydrop (who, I declare! looks rosier even than
\par before the middle of January, 1920) has adopted a hotel life altogether
\par of late. He explains to me that the advantage of this is the new
\par side-line activity of numerous compassionate bell captains, who, it
\par seems--but that would be telling.
\par 
\par One of the pleasantest things, I think, about hotels is the "night maid
\par service" furnished at fashionable places. When you come in you find your
\par light burning and so do not break your shins, and your bed is "turned
\par down" for you. Very softening to the spirit, this. In a kind of a sort
\par of a hazy way one's thoughts turn back to the maternal solicitude which
\par used to "tuck" one "in."
\par 
\par Good night!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER II
\par 
\par A HUMORIST MISFITS AT A MURDER TRIAL
\par 
\par 
\par Are you in on the great Crime Wave, brother? Almost everybody is, I
\par guess, in one way or another. What's your particular line? Murderer,
\par bandit, burglar, mortally wounded innocent bystander, juror, witness, or
\par victim? The police are in on it, too; every once in awhile one of them
\par gets blackjacked, or something like that.
\par 
\par I had the flu bad enough, when that was the big thing going; but somehow
\par so far I myself have escaped being caught in the Crime Wave. This gives
\par me the great advantage over most people of being a detached spectator of
\par the rollicking game.
\par 
\par I have a friend, though, who was caught up just a few days ago. He has
\par been telling me all about it. Murder case.
\par 
\par This fellow is a sort of author. He had served a time or two as a juror
\par in the Supreme Court of New York County. In that building down by the
\par City Hall. But he says those cases bored him terribly. They were
\par chicken-feed sort of rows, generally concerned with the question of how
\par many dollars and fractions thereof X had occasioned the loss of to Z by
\par reason of his failure to deliver such and such a quantity of (say)
\par beeswax before the drop in the market of 39.7-1/4 cents, as called for
\par by telephone agreement, possibly. The "Court" (a nice, pink and grey old
\par fellow) would go to sleep, with his mouth open, during the drone of the
\par legal argument, and be awakened automatically (apparently by some change
\par in atmospheric conditions) at the moment required for him to begin his
\par charge to the jury. Occasionally, he would come semi-to for an instant
\par before this, and indistinctly utter the words, "Objection sustained."
\par 
\par My friend's chief impression of these proceedings is his recollection of
\par one phenomenon which he observed. Not long after the opening of the
\par presentation of X's side of the case he saw very clearly that Z hadn't a
\par leg to stand on. It was ridiculous that he had the face to come into
\par court with an attempt to question the truth of facts which were as
\par apparent to the naked eye as the Woolworth Building. My friend felt it
\par needless to pay any further attention to the foolish formalities of the
\par argument. If he had not had an uneasy feeling that he might get pinched
\par for this, he would have gone to sleep, like the Judge.
\par 
\par But those were dull days in the jury business.
\par 
\par A little later my friend gets some sort of a ticket instructing him to
\par call and talk things over with a gentleman having the university degree
\par of Commissioner of Jurors. This gentleman asks my friend if he has ever
\par been arrested on a criminal charge, if he is opposed to capital
\par punishment, and if he has any prejudice against Episcopalians. My friend
\par is a man of liberal mind, and replies that he would just as soon hang an
\par Episcopalian as anybody else. "You're on," said the gentleman, reaching
\par for a blotter; and signed him up. My friend didn't know exactly for
\par what. But the gentleman said everything was all right, they might not
\par call on my friend for a long time, and then perhaps it would be a short
\par case.
\par 
\par Sometime back was all this. My friend had almost forgotten about his
\par acquaintance with the Commissioner. Then all of a sudden the gong sounds
\par and the great Crime Wave is on. Detectives dash madly about with
\par shotguns. A jeweller is shot every day after lunch and a subway
\par ticket-seller is robbed directly after every train starts. My friend
\par hurries home early because everybody is fined who is caught on any paved
\par street after dark, and there in his letter-box is the summons from his
\par old friend the Commissioner, who apparently has borne him in mind all
\par this while.
\par 
\par On the document is printed by a printing-press, "Jack Hammond _vs._ The
\par People of the State of New York." And on it is written with a pen my
\par friend's name, before the printed words "Special Juror." It very
\par urgently invites my friend to appear at ten o'clock four days distant at
\par the Criminal Courts Building and there "await further order of the
\par Court."
\par 
\par You get off the subway at Brooklyn Bridge, you know, and go, past the
\par Municipal Building, up Centre Street. A district around behind the
\par "lanes" (as they say of steamship travel) of general traffic, and one
\par infrequently traversed by my friend. He was much interested in the
\par spectacle hereabout. Buildings labelled Public Health on this hand,
\par buildings labelled Public Records on that. Then you come to that prison
\par as gruesome in its name as the Tower of London is romantic in its
\par connotation--the Tombs. The structure itself, a cluster of rather
\par slender wings, rises from behind its dark walls with an element of
\par grace, in contrast to that chill, squat, mouldering pile which begot and
\par bequeathed the historic name. Ugh! though, those barred windows, row
\par upon row, give a fellow such qualms as do the ugly symbols of our
\par mortality. Even though you ain't done nothin', make you feel sorta faint
\par like inside!
\par 
\par There in the south wall is a little door, like a rabbit burrow, with a
\par little group about it, and quite a small bustle going on. Standing in
\par this bit of a doorway, as though she had something to do in the way of
\par belonging there, is a queer, oval body who looks much as though she
\par might be what is called an "apple woman." Marked "Visitors' Entrance,"
\par this door. What is it all the people on this side of the street are
\par pausing to look at over there?
\par 
\par A cab is drawn up. From this lightly steps (or flashes) a dizzy dream.
\par "Floppy" hat, scant skirt awhirl, pink-hued stockings gleaming to the
\par height of the full curve behind the knee, tall satin pump-heels dancing
\par the wearer on her toes--she swirls through the dark doorway. "They all
\par have their wimmin," remarks a blousy-looking loiterer to my friend.
\par 
\par At the north, three stories up, the prison connects with the courts
\par building by that fabled structure the "bridge of sighs."
\par 
\par Lively scene before the main entrance to this edifice on Centre Street.
\par Streams of figures hurrying up the broad front steps--on their way to a
\par busy day at the height of the crime season. Taxis flying up and
\par discharging chattering groups as at a theatre. Open pops a taxi door,
\par out leap three. A couple of very hard-looking young men, of that
\par sawed-off, stocky stature frequently observed in this type of very
\par hard-looking young man. Elegantly dressed, these; between them one of
\par "Oh!-you-beautiful-doll" type. Rapidly they make their way up the steps,
\par as though very well acquainted with the place.
\par 
\par Regular jam inside. My friend learned from an attendant that his
\par particular destination was two flights up. Great crush wedging into the
\par elevator. Elevator man calls out merrily to an acquaintance he observes
\par outside his door: "It's a great life if you don't weaken!"
\par 
\par Threads his way, my friend, around the balcony, so to say, upstairs.
\par Centre of building open from ground floor to roof. Effect: spacious,
\par beautiful, ornamented in the richness of a house of grand opera. Finds
\par the right door. Card on the wall nearby. Several persons (tough-looking
\par youths in caps and soft collars) reading it. It lists previous day's
\par proceedings in this court room. Says: So-and-so; Murder; Indicted (or
\par something like that). Then the names of attorneys for the defense given.
\par Second line: So-and-so; Murder; etc. Third line: So-and-so; Murder.
\par Fourth line: So-and-so; Grand Larceny. Next line: So-an-so; Rape. Next:
\par Murder. And so on. Sure, my friend thinks, I've got to the real shop
\par this time. He has a few moments yet, and so he strolls over to a door at
\par the opposite side of the building. 'Nother card there. Same sort of
\par thing: murder, murder, grand larceny, homicide, murder, murder. (If you
\par don't believe it, go down there and look at those cards.) "Holy cat!"
\par says my friend to himself, "comparatively little of this crime stuff
\par gets into the papers, after all, don't it? I never heard of any of these
\par cases."
\par 
\par Enters court room. Takes a seat. Room soon filled. Now in my friend's
\par experience as a petit juror he had found himself among a rather
\par grotesque company of very small characters, frequently somewhat seedy in
\par outward effect. Here he was much struck by the decidedly first-rate
\par quality in appearance of practically every man in the room. Also,
\par before, he had observed with a good deal of annoyance that a court of
\par law could consume about twenty-nine times the time in accomplishing a
\par very simple matter that would be devoted to a thing of similar
\par consequence in any practical business office. Here in this flourishing
\par mill for dealing with capital crime the clerk of the court (or whatever
\par you call him) began to call the roll of jurors present fifteen minutes
\par before the hour set for opening of court. And so did affairs proceed
\par with well-oiled despatch.
\par 
\par "Oyez-mumble-jumble-jabber-jabber-yah-meow-wow-jumble-jabber-jumble" (or
\par whatever the devil it is), sang out the attendant who cries out that.
\par Everybody at once gets to his feet. In comes his corpulent Honor,
\par swinging along briskly, his gown flowing out behind, and mounts to his
\par wooden-canopied throne. A large, glossy, rather handsome face, neatly
\par cropped dark moustache, eye-glasses swinging from a broad black ribbon.
\par General effect what might be called that of a heavy-weight "club man,"
\par looks as if he might be quite a hearty fellow when out with "the boys."
\par 
\par Door opens at back of room. Sound of marching steps. Then are seen
\par coming along through a zoo-like cage round two sides of the room three
\par figures, burly civilian-clothed one in the middle, uniformed officer
\par fore and aft. They line up this side of a rail fencing the jurors off
\par from an area before the Judge. Burly figure is very well dressed. Stands
\par solidly on his feet, eyes trained directly on the Judge. Holds a dark
\par soft hat in his hands which he clasps behind his back. What from a
\par position somewhat to the rear can be seen of the side of his face
\par reveals a heavy scar, the result evidently of a knife slash across one
\par cheek. The Judge puts his palms together and addresses this person. "You
\par are charged with murder," he begins. He says it rather gently, in a
\par somewhat chiding manner, as though he had said, "Bad fellow, bad
\par fellow." Just then, "For the defendant!" calls out an attendant, and
\par another figure hurries forward.
\par 
\par The defendant's attorneys have not appeared, it seems. Their case is not
\par quite prepared. A postponement is asked. "Why is it not prepared?" asks
\par the Judge. The defendant speaks out. Declares his attorney has not been
\par paid. Judge's reply is that the attorney provided for him is an able
\par man, who will see that all his rights are observed. Grants postponement
\par until the next morning, positively no further. Officer by his side
\par plucks defendant's coat tail, and starts him off back through the cage.
\par As he goes he is heard to say that his attorney will not be there in the
\par morning either.
\par 
\par And as he turns, my friend gets, with a shock, a full-face view of him.
\par He had never expected anybody off the melodramatic stage to _look_ so
\par much like a murderer. Scarey, that face, a countenance almost majestic
\par in its ruthlessness and force: gangster, gunman, typically personified.
\par 
\par Jurors excused until ten-thirty next day. As they move toward the door,
\par two attractively dressed young women arise from the rear. "Who are the
\par ladies?" asks one. "Friends of the defendant," says another.
\par 
\par Next day, game called sharp on the stroke of the clock. Following
\par preliminaries of the day before, attendant spins that little roulette
\par wheel sort of an affair. Looks at slip thus drawn. "John Cole," he
\par cries. Mr. Cole passes round behind jury box, reappears in far corner at
\par left of Judge. "Rigmarole-rigmarole-solemnly swear, rigmarole," chaunts
\par attendant there, thrusting very dilapidated Bible before him. Mr. Cole
\par takes what later will be the witness chair.
\par 
\par Assistant district attorney arises and explains the case to him. The
\par charge is murder in the first degree. The prosecution must rely largely
\par on the testimony of an accomplice.
\par 
\par Defendant sits in whispered consultation with his attorney, his arm
\par almost around him. As prosecutor seats himself, attorney for the defense
\par gets up to put Mr. Cole through his paces. A fat, oily-looking man, with
\par (it is evident) a browbeating manner in reserve.
\par 
\par Has Mr. Cole, or anyone "near and dear" to him, recently met with any
\par "accident" at the hands of robbers? No. He will not, then, have a
\par revengeful feeling toward any person charged with crime? Not at all.
\par Would he give the same weight to the "story" of a "self-confessed thief
\par and murderer" that he would to the testimony of a "man of probity"?
\par Probably not. Now, doubtless, Mr. Cole is a reader of newspapers. He
\par has, of course, seen this "literature" (with a sneer), this "newspaper
\par hysteria" about a "c-r-i-m-e wave" (tongue in cheek). Well, can Mr. Cole
\par go into the jury box and look at this case detached from the
\par "atmosphere" now "being created by the newspapers"? Finally, is Mr. Cole
\par acquainted with anyone connected with the police department?
\par 
\par Mr. Cole, for some reason, strikes out.
\par 
\par Third man accepted. He comes around from behind it to enter the jury
\par box. At the gateway, while defendant stands and faces him, some more
\par rigmarole-mumble-jumble business.
\par 
\par Suddenly my friend is called. His business? asks district attorney. A
\par writer, he replies. Defendant and his attorney exchange strange glances.
\par Undoubtedly there is something low and suspicious about a fellow with
\par such a business. Attorney for the defense comes forward hurriedly. Soon
\par takes my friend in hand. He at once adopts the sarcastic. My friend's
\par work must require unusual "observation." He must be "gifted" with "great
\par powers of de-duct-shun" (said out of one corner of his mouth). Of
\par course, he has too a "fine imagination." By the way, what is the nature
\par of his writing? Has he written any novels?
\par 
\par No, my friend says, he is a humorous writer. "A what?" exclaims the
\par lawyer, his mouth remaining open. Then, "Like Don Mark_ee_?" "Somewhat,"
\par says my friend. Lawyer visibly pales. Withdrawing toward counsel table,
\par looks back at the accused, who vigorously shakes his head.
\par 
\par "Excused by per-emptory challenge," utters lawyer, dropping into his
\par chair.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER III
\par 
\par QUEER THING, 'BOUT UNDERTAKERS' SHOPS
\par 
\par 
\par Queer thing, that, about undertakers' shops! I don't remember to have
\par been struck by undertakers' shops in San Francisco. Maybe they have none
\par there--because, as you'll see, it's a queer thing about them.
\par 
\par Now in Indianapolis undertaking is a very fashionable affair. People
\par there, apparently, want "class" in the matter of being finally disposed
\par of. They believe, evidently, with the author of the popular little idyl,
\par "Urn Burial," that "Man is a noble animal, splendid in ashes and pompous
\par in the tomb."
\par 
\par The most aristocratic street in that city is named North Meridian
\par Street. A street, until a short time ago, entirely of stately lawns and
\par patrician homes--mansions. Of late, a little business, shops of the most
\par distinguished character, has been creeping up this street from
\par down-town. Notably, de luxe motor car salesrooms, studios of highly
\par \'e6sthetic photographers, and particularly palatial undertaking
\par establishments. They are, these last, wondrous halls, which surely none
\par could enter but those who (in life) had been rich in treasure. Features
\par of the city are they--"sights."
\par 
\par But here's the riddle:
\par 
\par Strolling about New York, from river to river, uptown and down, one
\par might readily fancy that here only the poor pass out of the world. Or
\par that if the rich and fashionable ever die their bodies are mysteriously
\par spirited away to destinations unknown; or are secretly preserved
\par (presumably by some taxidermal process) in their homes.
\par 
\par Why? Well, where on Fifth Avenue is an undertaker's? True, a man I know
\par declares there is a single one there. I am unable to find it. Where on
\par any fine street of the metropolis? Why, yes; as a rare phenomenon. You
\par do know, of course, that enormous place on upper Broadway. Sign says
\par branches in Paris, London, Berlin, Petrograd.
\par 
\par Viewed through the great windows interior presents somewhat the effect
\par of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In foreground large harp, equally
\par huge Chinese vase--probably of the Tang Wang period, on great marble
\par pedestal enormous bronze of a mounted Diana repelling with spear attack
\par of ferocious animal resembling tiger. Appropriateness of this sculpture
\par somewhat puzzling. On wall, somewhat further within, immense tapestry.
\par One door labelled "Delivery Entrance." All of this, of course, is
\par magnificence as much as even the most covetous would crave.
\par 
\par But in New York this august undertaking hall is an anachronism. Here,
\par for some reason mysterious, it is in shabby neighborhoods that the
\par "parlors" of undertakers abound. You may find them sprinkled all about
\par the lower East Side. Frequent on Hudson Street, and, say, on Varick.
\par Quaint and curious places, these. Very human in their appeal. Tiny
\par places, most of them.
\par 
\par One such cozy crib I know on Greenwich Avenue. Has a stained glass
\par screen in the window, suggesting a good deal the style of window
\par ornamentation popular with that American institution lately
\par deceased--the saloon. The social spirit rife in small undertaking shops,
\par at least in some of them, is pleasant to observe. Business there not
\par being pressing, and life moving in these inns of death in a leisurely
\par and quiet current, neighborly amenities appear to be much cultivated.
\par 
\par This place of which I speak has, particularly in the evenings, much the
\par air of a club, where choice spirits of the locality foregather to
\par discuss politics, it may be, and the more engrossing forms of sport,
\par such as boxing. And perhaps relish a little game at cards. I often pass
\par this place at night and feel a warmth of spirit at the hum of jovial
\par social contact within.
\par 
\par I like, too, the way the undertakers' shops of the humble and obscure
\par carry on cheek by jowl with the familiar, homely, friendly things of
\par life. This gives Death a neighborly sort of air. On my walks in that
\par quarter I always give a friendly glance to the windows of a "Cremation
\par Ass'n" on Eighth Avenue, on one side of it a delicatessen shop, on the
\par other a "loan office," in the basement below a plumber.
\par 
\par Attractive, too, is it to consider how founders of tidy undertaking
\par houses have become personages and are held in revered esteem. For they
\par are not, it would seem, like unto those who have established just
\par ordinary businesses. This I will show you:
\par 
\par At a corner of Twenty-third Street, over a telegraph office, is an
\par establishment of some caste. Window legend reads:
\par "Undertakers--Cremations--Night and Day--Interments in all Cemeteries."
\par The last phrase reminds me of the way my old friend James Huneker used
\par to date his letters to me from Brooklyn. They began, "Flatbush by the
\par C--emeteries." But that's not the point. It's a pity the alert English
\par writer who recently visited us and discovered a statue of General Grant
\par in Grant Park, overlooking the Blackstone (where nobody had ever seen
\par one before), and that the huge bust of Washington Irving in Bryant Park,
\par behind the New York Public Library, was an effigy of Father George
\par Washington--it's a rotten shame E. V. Lucas missed this corner while
\par here.
\par 
\par Because when you go round this corner you are to look up just above the
\par level of your head. (Though I'm afraid you neglect to do this.) There on
\par a ledge is a grand sight. It's a bust of God. Fact! Anyhow, looks just
\par like pictures of God William Blake used to make. Old gentleman. Noble
\par brow. Patriarchal beard, flowing out in a pattern of rhythmical
\par waves--most realistically mildewed by time and weather.... But, no;
\par inquiry reveals that it's a likeness of the founder of this "old
\par established" undertaking concern.
\par 
\par Then there's that place a short step down Eighth Avenue. It declares on
\par its sign that it is the "original" house bearing the name of the
\par Reverend gentleman who conducts it. When you look through the glass in
\par the door you view just within, displayed on an ornamental easel, a
\par life-size crayon portrait, enlarged from a photograph, of a
\par distinguished-looking person wearing brown Dundreary whiskers and a top
\par hat. One corner of the portrait is gracefully draped in an American
\par flag.
\par 
\par Yes; you'd be surprised how strong undertakers are on patriotism. Hard
\par by here, next door to a dentist advertising "painless extraction," you
\par find a firm of "Funeral Directors" where conspicuous among such
\par ornaments as tall, bronze lamps with big shades, a spittoon, a little
\par model of a casket and an urn, is a large bronze bust of Abraham Lincoln.
\par A plate says: "No Charge for Rooms or Chapels for Funerals." And above
\par stairs is seen a row of somewhat ecclesiastical stained-glass windows.
\par Though we are given to understand by an advertisement that the
\par atmosphere of these chapels is "non-sectarian."
\par 
\par Then over on Third Avenue (where there are lots and lots of undertakers)
\par is a place. Always sitting just within the doorway, very silent, a
\par stout, very solemn individual wearing a large, black derby hat and big,
\par round, green-lens spectacles. Above him on the wall a framed lithograph
\par in colors of George Washington--beside it a thermometer. In the window a
\par rubber-plant. Rubber-plants varying in size from infant to elephant are
\par in the windows of all undertakers. The symbolism of this decoration I
\par know not. Beside the plant an infant's white casket, proclaimed by a
\par poster which leans against it to be composed of "purity metal." In some
\par places the casket, perhaps not of purity metal, is protected by being
\par enclosed in a glass case. The name of the proprietor of this shop, as
\par given on his sign, ends in "skey." Set in the door-frame is the usual
\par "Night Bell." And, as always in undertakers' shops, the card of a
\par "notary public" is displayed. Next door "Family Shoes" are featured.
\par 
\par Only yesterday afternoon I was looking in at the window of an undertaker
\par on Second Avenue, one I had just found. Along the curb before the door
\par a string of rather frayed and wobbly-looking "hacks," with a rusty-black
\par hearse at the head. Horses to these vehicles drowsy in disposition,
\par moth-eaten in effect as to pelt, and in the visibility of their
\par anatomical structure suggesting that they might have been drawn by
\par Albert D\'fcrer in some particularly melancholy mood.
\par 
\par In groups along the edge of the sidewalk, conversing in subdued tones,
\par the Dickensesque drivers of this caravan. Tall and gaunt, some; short
\par and stout, others. Skirt coat on one, "sack" coat on another. Alike in
\par this: frayed and rusty and weather-beaten, all. And hard, very hard of
\par countenance. Each topped by a very tall, and quite cylindrical hat of
\par mussed, shoddy-black, plush texture. Hangovers, so to say, these
\par figures, from New York's hansom-cab days, or the time in London of the
\par "four-wheeler."
\par 
\par No, not altogether. There was something piquant--Villonesque, or
\par jovial--Rabelaisian, about the pickpockets of that tribe. These solemn
\par mummers strike a ghoulish note. But at the same time, out here in the
\par sane and cheerful sunlight, they don't look real. Create an odd
\par impression. Strikes you as about as queer, this bunch, as if a lot of
\par actors from a melodrama should turn up in the street with their makeup
\par on and gravely pretend to belong to real life.
\par 
\par "Perhaps," I thought, "there is a funeral, or something, going on
\par inside, and I should not be gaping in at this window."
\par 
\par Out of doorway pops little, rotund man, oily countenance. "Are you
\par looking for anybody?" he asks.
\par 
\par "Here," I said inwardly, "is where I get moved on." No, I told him, I
\par was just observing his window.
\par 
\par "Ah!" he cried, immensely flattered. He waved his hand back toward a
\par couple of little, marble crosses with hearts carved in relief on the
\par base. "You don't often see that, do you? Do you, now? They're sixty
\par years old. Made out of a single piece!"
\par 
\par But the saddest thing about undertakers' shops is to go by where was one
\par long familiar to you and find it gone. There was a splendid little place
\par which it was a great consolation to me to admire. That building is now
\par given over to an enterprise called "The Goody Shop." Its lofty dignity
\par and deep eloquence are gone! It looks like a department store. It is
\par labelled, with the blare of a brass band, "The Home of Pussy Willow
\par Chocolates."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER IV
\par 
\par THE HAIR CUT THAT WENT TO MY HEAD
\par 
\par 
\par I did not expect anything in particular when I went in. Though, indeed,
\par it is a very famous place. That is, the hotel is--the Brevoort.
\par 
\par The name itself, Brevoort, is very rich in romantic Knickerbocker
\par associations. Probably you know all about that. Or, possibly, you don't
\par know--or have forgotten. Well, you do know how Broadway curves around
\par there at Tenth Street. That ought to recall Hendrick Brevoort to you.
\par His farm was all about this neighborhood. Caused this kink, he did, so
\par it is said.
\par 
\par This valorous descendant of the old burgher defied the commissioners to
\par destroy his homestead, which lay in the proposed path of Broadway. Or to
\par cut down a favorite tree which blocked the intended course of Eleventh
\par Street. Stood at his threshold with a blunderbuss in his trembling old
\par hands (so the story has it), when the workmen arrived to carry out their
\par instructions to demolish the house--and carried his point so
\par effectively that Broadway was deflected from its course, while Eleventh
\par Street between Broadway and Fourth Avenue was never completed. Grace
\par Church, which now stands at about where valiant Henry stood that day,
\par was built by a descendant of his, the architect also of St. Patrick's
\par Cathedral.
\par 
\par I like to think of these matters sometimes when I enter the cool cream
\par beauty of this ancient frame hostelry.
\par 
\par Also of another Henry Brevoort, a descendant of the original proprietor
\par of the farm in New Netherland, who built the substantial old double
\par house at the corner of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. Fine iron
\par balconies, pillared door, within a small green enclosure, and a walled
\par garden to one side: all preserved.
\par 
\par Here was held (in 1840) the first masked ball given in New York. An
\par affair of picturesque celebrity, on account of the occasion it furnished
\par a famous beauty of the day, Miss Mathilda Barclay, daughter of Anthony
\par Barclay, the British consul, to elope in fancy dress, domino and mask
\par with a certain young Burgwyne of South Carolina, of whom her parents had
\par unamiable views. She went as Lalla Rookh and he as Feramorz, and in
\par this disguise they slipped away from the ball, at four in the morning,
\par and were married. That, it seems to me, is the way for a man who does
\par not enjoy solemn ceremonies to be happy while getting married.
\par 
\par Across the way, at the corner of Eighth Street, the mellow white hotel
\par maintains the distinguished name, and touches "the Avenue" with a very
\par aromatic French flavor. Famous for its cuisine, largely patronized by
\par the transient French population of the city, a habitual port of call of
\par many painters and writers, the scene of the annual Illustrators' Ball,
\par and so on.
\par 
\par I like within the frequent spectacle of gentlemen of magnificent bulk
\par and huge black beards, in general effect impressively suggesting the
\par probability of their all being Academicians. I like the fact (or the
\par hypothesis) that all the waiters are Looeys and Sharses and Gastongs. I
\par like the little marble-top tables with wire spindle legs. I like the
\par lady patrons (Oh! immensely) who are frequently very chic (and with
\par exquisite ankles). I like the young gentlemen customers, who (many of
\par them) look exactly as though their faces were modelled in wax, and who
\par wear the sort of delicate moustaches that are advertised in _Vanity
\par Fair_.
\par 
\par But even more I like the quaintness of the scene without doors. There
\par along the curb, you recall, stand (in summer beneath the pleasant
\par greenery of drooping trees), awaiting hire, a succession of those
\par delightful, open, low-swung, horse-drawn vehicles, victorias, which were
\par the fashionable thing at the period named by Mrs. Wharton "The Age of
\par Innocence." The romantically leisurely drivers of these unbelievably
\par leisurely craft are perfectly turned out to be, so to say, in the
\par picture. They affect coachmen's coats (piquantly tempered by age) with
\par large silver buttons and, in mild weather, top hats constructed of
\par straw, painted black. In some instances these coachmen are
\par "colored"--which is a very pleasant thing, too, I think.
\par 
\par This hotel, naturally, has figured in a number of pieces of fiction. In
\par Samuel Merwin's novel "The Trufflers" it is the Parisian, where
\par Greenwich Village, when in funds, dines, lunches, breakfasts in the
\par little rooms which you enter from the Avenue, directly under the wide
\par front steps, or from the side street through the bar, and where Upper
\par West Side, when seeking the quaintly foreign dissociated from squalor,
\par goes up the steps into the airy eating rooms with full length hinged
\par windows to dine. And where (in this book) the young lady whose blooming
\par presence in the barber shop in the basement invites you to manicure
\par attentions gives rise to some very dramatic occurrences. The place, this
\par shop, of Marius (as called in the story), "the one barber in New York
\par who does not ask 'Wet or dry.'"
\par 
\par Now I had plumb forgotten about this barber's celebrity in fiction when
\par the other day I entered this shop. And I was struck with embarrassment
\par by the immediate attentions of so very distinguished a figure as that
\par which sprang forward to assist me out of my coat. I thought surely this
\par gentleman must be some kind of an Ambassador, who had perhaps mistaken
\par me for the President. A slimmish man, obviously very French. Amazingly,
\par overwhelmingly polite. Fine, a very fine beard. Long. Swept his chest.
\par Pointed. Auburn. Wavy. Silken. Shot delicately with grey. Beautifully
\par kept. Responded gently to the breeze--waving softly to and fro. A most
\par beautiful beard--oh, my! And a glorious crown of hair! It rose from the
\par line of its parting in a billowing wave, then fell with a luxuriant and
\par graceful sweep to his ear. Only when he had tucked me in the chair could
\par I realize that this must be the head barber. I had never before had the
\par honor of being served by, or even of having seen himself, the proprietor
\par here.
\par 
\par Then I mentioned Mr. Merwin's book. He took from a drawer several copies
\par of _The Saturday Evening Post_, in which periodical the story had
\par appeared serially, proudly to exhibit them to me. So it was we fell to
\par chatting of his place. He had been here some sixteen or eighteen years.
\par Before he had opened his shop this room had been several tiny rooms;
\par Cleveland Moffett had for a time occupied them as a residence, and had
\par here written his first book. My friend gayly produced a copy of an old
\par magazine article by Mr. Moffett in which mention was given the shop.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par Shaved, I was straightened up to have my hair trimmed. And, being for a
\par moment free to look about. I spied a card on the wall. It said:
\par 
\par       SILK HATS IRONED
\par             25_\'a2_
\par     COUP-DE-FER-AU CHAPEAU
\par 
\par But, my goodness! That was not all. No, indeed!
\par 
\par _This very man who was cutting my hair_ had cut the hair of General
\par Joffre--when he had his hair here in the United States. At "Mr. Frick's
\par house," where they were guests, he had attended the distinguished party
\par on its mission here. He would go in the morning, stay until they had
\par gone forth for the day; return in the afternoon, and spruce them up for
\par their evening out.
\par 
\par And what did they say, these great men of might?
\par 
\par Well, Joffre didn't say much. They were always out late--hurry out
\par again. He shaved some of them "almost in the bath." That fellow, the
\par Blue Devil,--one leg--cane--but back and forth from his bath quick like
\par anybody. He was the most talkative:
\par 
\par "I could not but laugh at what he told me. I asked, 'Do you speak
\par English?' 'No,' he said, 'but I ought to.' 'How is that?' I asked.
\par 'Because,' he said, 'I'm half American.' 'Oh!' I said, 'your father then
\par was American and your mother French?' 'No,' he said. 'Ah!' I say, 'then
\par your mother was American and your father was French.' Do you
\par understand? I say that to him. 'No,' he say; 'no.' 'What then?' I ask.
\par 'Why,' he say, 'I have one leg in France and one leg in America.' I
\par could not but laugh. Do you understand?"
\par 
\par When the visitors had departed Mr. Frick asked my friend for his bill.
\par "Oh, no!" he said; "he would take nothing but the great honor for his
\par little services."
\par 
\par My hair cut was finished. As I paid him (there being in this case, I
\par felt, no such great honor for his little services), he showed me a
\par drawing on the wall of a poodle he had one time owned. It had died. Very
\par sad. He was very fond of dogs. Of bred dogs, that is. He bred them
\par himself. He handed me his card as a professional dog fancier. It read:
\par 
\par                    CHINK A TU KENNELS
\par     CHOW CHOWS, PEKINGESES, POMERANIANS, ALL COLORS
\par               FROM PRICE WINNING STOCK
\par                MINIATURE SPECIMENS
\par         AT STUD. PEKINGESE, WONDERFUL SON OF WENTY
\par              OF HYDEGREE. FEE REASONABLE.
\par     AT STUD. LORD CHOLMONDELEY III SON OF CHAMPION
\par                  LORD CHOLMONDELEY II.
\par                TOY DOGS BOARDED
\par                   MME. HENRI GRECHEN
\par 
\par Yes, that morning he had done "some manicure work" for his dogs. She
\par looked up, the manicurist (milk-white blonde, black velvet gown), and
\par said, "Do you use the clippers?"
\par 
\par He: "Yes, of course. But not powder and polish. Quick, they want. Not
\par hold hands for hour--conversation about best show in town."
\par 
\par He bowed, very low, as I crossed his threshold. I turned and bowed, very
\par low, to him. A man of many parts and a barber illustrious in his
\par profession. It was some time before my head cooled off.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER V
\par 
\par SEEING MR. CHESTERTON
\par 
\par 
\par Somewhat later in this article I am going to present an "interview" (or
\par something like that) with Gilbert E. Chesterton. At least I hope I am
\par going to present it. Yesterday it looked as though I might have to get
\par up my interview without having seen Mr. Chesterton. Though today the
\par situation appears somewhat brighter. "Seeing" Mr. Chesterton (on his
\par visit over here, at any rate) seems to be a complicated matter.
\par 
\par As anything which gives some view of the workings of the Chestertonian
\par machinery ought to be of interest to all who can lay claim to the happy
\par state of mind of being Chestertonites, I'll begin by telling the
\par proceedings so far in this affair. Then as matters progress to supply me
\par with more material (if they do progress) I'll continue.
\par 
\par I one time wrote an article in which I told with what surprising ease I
\par saw Mr. Chesterton several years ago in England. Without acquaintances
\par in England, some sort of a fit of impudence seized me. I wrote Mr.
\par Chesterton a letter, communicating to him the intelligence that I had
\par arrived in London, that it was my belief that he was one of the noblest
\par and most interesting monuments in England; and I asked him if he
\par supposed that he could be "viewed" by me, at some street corner, say, at
\par a time appointed, as he rumbled past in his triumphal car. Mrs.
\par Chesterton replied directly in a note that her husband wished to thank
\par me for my letter and to say that he would be pleased if I cared to come
\par down to spend an afternoon with him at Beaconsfield. Mr. Chesterton, I
\par later recollected, had no means readily at hand of ascertaining whether
\par or not I was an American pickpocket; but from the deference of his
\par manner I was led to suspect that he vaguely supposed I was perhaps the
\par owner of the New York _Times_, or somebody like that.
\par 
\par This escapade of my visit to Overroads I suppose it was that put into
\par the head of the editor of _The Bookman_ the notion that I was a person
\par with ready access to Mr. Chesterton. So I was served with a hurry-up
\par assignment to see him and to deliver an article about my seeing him for
\par the March number of the magazine before that issue, then largely in the
\par hands of the printers, got off the press. Thus my adventures, the
\par termination of which are at present considerably up in the air, began.
\par 
\par I at once wrote to Mr. Chesterton at the hotel where at the moment he
\par was in Boston. At the same time I wrote to Lee Keedick ("Manager of the
\par World's Most Celebrated Lecturers") at his office in New York. I had
\par picked up the impression that a lecture manager of this caliber owned
\par outright the time of a visiting celebrity whom he promoted, and that you
\par couldn't even telephone the celebrity without the manager's permission.
\par I didn't know that you couldn't telephone him anyway. Or that you
\par couldn't telephone the manager either.
\par 
\par Mr. Keedick very promptly replied that he would be very glad to do
\par everything that he could to bring about the interview. Or at least I
\par received a very courteous letter to this effect which bore a signature
\par which I took to be that of Mr. Keedick.
\par 
\par Mr. Chesterton was not to be back in New York until after a couple of
\par days. On the day set for his return to town I attempted to communicate
\par with Mr. Keedick by telephone. I am (I fear) a bit slow at the etiquette
\par of telephones, and I so far provoked a young woman at the other end of
\par the wire as to cause her to demand rather sharply, "Who are you?" This
\par matter adjusted amicably, Mr. Keedick it developed was so utterly remote
\par from attainment that I am not altogether sure such a person exists.
\par However, another gentleman responded cordially enough. Still, it seemed
\par to me (upon reflection) that in a matter of this urgent nature I had
\par been at fault in having failed to obtain more definiteness in the matter
\par of an appointment. So I went round to the manager's office. Very affably
\par received. Presented to a gentleman fetched for that purpose from another
\par room, where he had been closeted with someone else. Mr. Widdecombe, this
\par gentleman's name. Introduced as Mr. Chesterton's secretary. A pronounced
\par Englishman in effect. Said very politely indeed, several times, that he
\par was "delighted." Mr. Chesterton, however, was going away tomorrow. Would
\par return two days hence. Made, Mr. Widdecombe, very careful memorandum of
\par my address.
\par 
\par In due course of time thought I'd better look up Mr. Widdecombe
\par again--his memorandum might have got mislaid. Telephoned lecture bureau.
\par Satisfied young lady of honorable intentions. Explained matters all over
\par again to owner of agreeable masculine voice. Received assurance that Mr.
\par Widdecombe would be reminded at once of pressing state of affairs.
\par Disturbed by uneventful flight of time, called in at lecture bureau once
\par more. Learned that Mr. Widdecombe had not yet turned up. They, however,
\par would try to get him on the wire at the Biltmore for me. Yes, he was
\par there, but the fourth floor desk of the hotel said he had just gone into
\par Mr. Chesterton's room, and so (as, apparently, everyone ought to know)
\par could not be communicated with just now. He would call up shortly.
\par Lecture people suggested that I go round to the hotel. If Mr. Widdecombe
\par called in the meantime they'd tell him I was on my way over.
\par 
\par Thought I recognized the gentleman stepping out of the elevator at the
\par fourth floor. I did not know whether or not it was at all what you did
\par to lay hold of an Englishman in so abrupt a fashion, but concluded this
\par would have to be done. Mr. Widdecombe was all courtesy. The point,
\par however, was that "Mr. Chesterton had had an hour of it this morning.
\par Had had an hour of it." This afternoon he was getting off some work for
\par London. Then tomorrow, of course, would be his lecture. My matter _did_
\par seem to be urgent. But what could "we" do? Mr. Chesterton was a
\par "beautiful man." He had been so hospitable to the gentlemen of the
\par press. But if we should go in to him now he would say, "Dear me! Dear
\par me!" I readily saw, of course, that this would be an awful thing,
\par still....
\par 
\par Mr. Widdecombe was somewhat inclined to think that we "could do" this:
\par Suppose I should come to the Times Square Theatre the next afternoon, at
\par about a quarter to five, call for him at the stage entrance. Yes, he
\par thought we could arrange it that way. I could talk to Mr. Chesterton in
\par the taxi on the way back to the hotel. Perhaps detain him for a few
\par moments afterward. Mr. Widdecombe smiled very pleasantly indeed at the
\par idea of so happy a solution of our difficulties. And I myself was rather
\par taken by the notion of interviewing Mr. Chesterton in a cab. The fancy
\par occurred to me that this was perhaps after all the most fitting place
\par in the whole world in which to interview Mr. Chesterton.
\par 
\par So everything seems to be all right.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par New complications! (This is the following day.) In the morning mail a
\par letter from Mrs. Chesterton, saying so sorry not to have answered my
\par letter before, but it had been almost impossible to deal with the
\par correspondence that had reached them since they arrived in America. Her
\par husband asked her to say he would very much like to see me. And could I
\par call at the hotel round about twelve o'clock on Sunday morning? No
\par difficulty about meeting Mr. Chesterton in the kindness of that. But
\par Sunday might be quite too late for the purpose of my article. So I'll go
\par to the theatre anyway, and I'll certainly accept all Chesterton
\par invitations.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par A colored dignitary in a uniform sumptuously befrogged with gold lace
\par who commanded the portal directed me to the stage entrance. I passed
\par into a dark and apparently deserted passage and paused to consider my
\par next step. Before me was a tall, brightly lighted aperture, and coming
\par through this I caught the sound, gently rising and falling, of a rather
\par dulcet voice. A slight pause in the flow of individual utterance, and
\par directly following upon this a soft wave as of the intimate mirth of an
\par audience wafted about what was evidently the auditorium beyond. Just
\par then a figure duskily defined itself before me and addressed me in a
\par gruff whisper. I was directed to proceed around the passage extending
\par ahead, to Room Three. I should have passed behind a tall screen (I
\par recognized later), but inadvertently I passed before it, and suddenly
\par found myself the target of thousands upon thousands of eyes--and the
\par unmistakable back of Mr. Chesterton looming in the brilliance directly
\par before me.
\par 
\par Regaining the passage, I found a door labelled A 3. Receiving no
\par response to my knock, I opened it; and peered into a lighted cubby-hole
\par about one-third the size of a very small hall bed-room. The only object
\par of any conspicuousness presented to me was a huge, dark garment hanging
\par from a hook in the wall. It seemed to be--ah! yes; it was a voluminous
\par overcoat with a queer cape attached. So; I was in the right shop all
\par right.
\par 
\par I thought I ought to look around and try to find somebody. I wandered
\par into what I suppose are the "wings" of the theatre. Anyway, I had an
\par excellent view, from one side, of the stage and of a portion of one
\par gallery. The only person quite near me was a fireman, who paid no
\par attention whatever to me, but continued to gaze out steadily at Mr.
\par Chesterton, with an expression of countenance which (as well as I could
\par decipher it) registered fascinated incomprehension. I attempted to lean
\par against what I supposed was a wall, but to my great fright the whole
\par structure nearly tumbled over as I barely touched it. Perceiving a chair
\par the other side of the fireman, I passed before him, sat down, and gave
\par myself over to contemplation of the spectacle.
\par 
\par My first impression, I think, was that Mr. Chesterton was speaking in so
\par conversational a key that I should have expected to hear cries of
\par "Louder!" coming from all over the house. But from the lighted
\par expressions of the faces far away in the corner of the gallery visible
\par to me he was apparently being followed perfectly. I did not then know
\par that at his first public appearance in New York he had referred to his
\par lecturing voice as the original mouse that came from the mountain. Nor
\par had I then seen Francis Hackett's comment upon it that: "It wasn't, of
\par course, a bellow. Neither was it a squeak." Mr. Hackett adds that it is
\par "the ordinary good lecture-hall voice." I do not feel that this quite
\par describes my own impression of it the other afternoon. Rather, perhaps,
\par I should put the matter in this way. My recollection of the conversation
\par I had with him in 1914 at Beaconsfield is that there was a much more
\par ruddy quality to his voice then than the other day, and more, much more,
\par in the turn of his talk a racy note of the burly world.
\par 
\par Perhaps he feels that before a "representative" American audience one
\par should be altogether what used to be called "genteel." At any rate, I
\par certainly heard the other day the voice of a modest, very friendly,
\par cultivated, nimble-minded gentleman, speaking with the nicety of
\par precision more frequently observed among English people than among
\par Americans. There was in it even a trace of a tone as though it were most
\par at home within university walls. Though, indeed, I am glad to say, Mr.
\par Chesterton did not abstain from erudite, amused, and amusing allusions
\par to the society most at home in "pubs." And I cannot but suspect that
\par perhaps he would have been found a shade more amusing even than he was
\par if ... but, no matter.
\par 
\par One gentleman who has written a piece about his impressions of Mr.
\par Chesterton's lectures here felt that his audience didn't have quite as
\par much of a good time as the members of it expected to have. I heard only
\par a brief, concluding portion of one lecture. The portion of the audience
\par which came most closely before my observation were those seated at the
\par well filled press table, which stood directly between the speaker and
\par me. These na\'efve beings gave every evidence of getting, to speak
\par temperately, their money's worth.
\par 
\par Though Mr. Chesterton turned the pages of notes as he spoke, he could
\par not be said to have read his lecture. On the other hand, it was clear
\par that he did not appreciably depart from a carefully prepared
\par disquisition.
\par 
\par The tumbled mane which tops him off seemed more massive even than
\par before. It did not, though, appear quite so tumbled. I think there had
\par been an effort (since 1914) to brush it quite nicely. Certainly it is
\par ever so much greyer. I think in my earlier article I said something like
\par this: "Mr. Chesterton has so remarkably red a face that his smallish
\par moustache seems lightish in color against it." While Mr. Chesterton's
\par face today could not be described as pale, it looks more like a face and
\par less like a glowing full moon. The moustache is darker against it; less
\par bristling than before, more straggly.
\par 
\par A couple of our recent commentators upon Mr. Chesterton have taken a
\par fling at the matter of his not being as huge as, it seems to them, he
\par has been made out to be. I remember that when I saw him before I was
\par even startled to find him more monstrous than even he had appeared in
\par his pictures. He appears to take part a good deal in pageants in
\par England; and recent photographs of him as Falstaff, or Tony Weller, or
\par Mr. Pickwick, or somebody like that, have not altogether squared up with
\par my recollection of him. True, he has not quite the bulk he had before;
\par but it is a captious critic, I should say, who would not consider him
\par sufficiently elephantine for all ordinary purposes.
\par 
\par He was saying (much to the delight of the house) when I became one of
\par the audience, that he would "not regard this as the time or the occasion
\par for him to comment upon the lid on liquor." A bit later in the course of
\par his answer to the question he had propounded, "Shall We Abolish the
\par Inevitable," he got an especially good hand when he remarked: "People
\par nowadays do not like statements having authority--but they will accept
\par any statement without authority." He concluded his denunciation of the
\par idea of fatalism with the declaration: "Whatever man is, he is not in
\par one sense a part of nature." "He has committed crimes, Crimes," he
\par repeated--with gusto in the use of the word,--"and performed heroisms
\par which no animal ever tried to do. Let us hold ourselves free from the
\par boundary of the material order of things, for so shall we have a chance
\par in the future to do things far too historic for prophecy."
\par 
\par I darted back toward Room Three, ran into Mr. Widdecombe, we wheeled,
\par and saw the mountain approaching. Whereas before, this off-stage place
\par had been deserted, now the scene was populous--with the figures of
\par agitated young women. Mr. Widdecombe, however, with much valiance
\par secured Mr. Chesterton. "Yes, yes," he said, and (remarkable remark!),
\par "I had the pleasure of meeting you in England." He glanced about rather
\par nervously at the dancing figures seeking to obtain him, and led the way
\par for me into the dressing room. Mr. Widdecombe pulled the door to from
\par without.
\par 
\par I am far from being as large as Mr. Chesterton, but the two of us
\par closeted in that compartment was an absurdity. Mr. Chesterton eclipsed a
\par chair, and beamed upon me with an expression of Cheeryble-like
\par brightness. Upon his arrival in New York he had declared to the press
\par that he would not write a book of his impressions of the United States.
\par I asked him if, after being here a week or so, he had changed his mind
\par as to this determination. "Not definitely," he said, "not definitely.
\par But, of course, one could never tell what one might do." He might write
\par a book about us, then? Yes, he might. Did he think it at all likely that
\par he would take up residence over here? A very joyous smile: "One's own
\par country is best," he said. Rumors had several times been afloat that he
\par had entered the Roman Catholic Church. Would he say whether there was
\par any likelihood of his doing this? He was an Anglican Catholic, he
\par replied. Not a Roman Catholic--yet. That was not to say that he might
\par not be--if the English Church should become more Protestant. What was
\par his next book to be? Had he any project in mind of going to Turkey, or
\par Mexico, or some such place? No; the only books he was working on at
\par present were a new volume of short stories and a book (smiling again
\par widely) on eugenics. He knew Mr. Lucas, of course? "Yes, fine fellow."
\par Did he know Frank Swinnerton? No. What was.... But the door was popped
\par open. Several persons were waiting for him, among them Mrs. Chesterton.
\par I helped him into the cape-coat. Stood behind the door so that when it
\par was opened he could get out. "You know Mr. Holliday," he said to Mrs.
\par Chesterton. "Thank you, so much," he said to me. And was whisked away.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par Sunday at the hotel. He was late in arriving. I thought it would be
\par pleasanter to wait a bit out in front. Expected he would drive up soon
\par in a taxi. Then I saw him coming around the corner, walking, rolling
\par slowly from side to side like a great ship, Mrs. Chesterton with him--a
\par little lady whose stature suggested the idea of a yacht gracefully
\par cruising alongside the huge craft. I wonder if, nowadays when most
\par writers seem to try to look like something else, Mr. Chesterton knows
\par how overwhelmingly like a great literary figure he looks.
\par 
\par When we were seated, I asked if he had any dope on his "New Jerusalem"
\par book. He began to tell me how surprised he had been to find Jerusalem as
\par it is. But the substance of this you may find in the book. He expressed
\par sympathy with the idea of Zionism. Remarked that he "might become a
\par Zionist if it could be accomplished in Zion." All that he could find to
\par tell me about his "New Jerusalem" was that it had been "written on the
\par spot." Seemed very disinclined to talk about his own books. Said his
\par feeling in general about each one of them was that he "hoped something
\par would happen to it before anybody saw it."
\par 
\par His surprise at Jerusalem suggested to me the question, Had he been
\par surprised at the United States--what he had seen of it? But he dodged
\par giving any "view" of us. His only comment was on the "multitudinous
\par wooden houses."
\par 
\par Had he met many American authors? The one most recently met, a day or so
\par ago in Northampton, though he had met him before in England, was a
\par gentleman he liked very much. He was so thin Mr. Chesterton thought the
\par two of them "should go around together." His name? Gerald Stanley Lee.
\par 
\par But there is not a particle more of time that I can spend on this
\par article.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VI
\par 
\par WHEN IS A GREAT CITY A SMALL VILLAGE?
\par 
\par 
\par How many times you have noticed it! Regular phenomenon. Suddenly, within
\par a few hours, the whole nature of the great city is changed--your city
\par and mine, New York or Chicago, or Boston or Buffalo or Philadelphia.
\par 
\par Though nobody seems to say much about it afterward. Just sort of take
\par the thing for granted.
\par 
\par It is just like Armistice Night, every once in awhile. Total strangers
\par suddenly begin to call each other "Neighbor." Voices everywhere become
\par jollier. Numerous passersby begin to whistle and sing. People go with a
\par skip and a jump. Catcalls are heard. Groups may be seen all around going
\par arm in arm, and here and there with arms about necks. Anybody speaks to
\par you merrily. Merrily you speak to anybody. All eyes shine. Roses are in
\par every cheek. Hurry is abandoned. Small boys run wild. Nobody now objects
\par to their stealing a ride. It is fun to see their swinging legs dangling
\par over the tail of every wagon. Sour human nature is purged. Good humor
\par reigns. Hurrah!
\par 
\par I mean on the night of a big snow.
\par 
\par This year it looked for long as though we were going to be done out of
\par this truly Dickensean festival. Seemed like we were going to be like
\par those unfortunate people in Southern California, who never have any
\par winter to cheer them up. How tired they must get of their wives and
\par neighbors, with it bland summer all the time. Perhaps that is the reason
\par there is such a promiscuous domestic life out there.
\par 
\par Young Will Shakespeare had the dope. He piped the weather for jollity
\par and pep. "When blood is nipp'd"--"a merry note!"
\par 
\par You remember how it was this time: Spring all winter--and spring fever,
\par too, a good many of us had all the while. (My doctor said it was
\par "malaria" with me.) We were congratulating ourselves that we were going
\par to "get by" without any "blizzards" at all this year. We became "softy."
\par We guarded ourselves with our umbrellas against the shower. We became
\par prudent. And what is it Stevenson says of that? "So soon as prudence has
\par begun to grow up in the brain, like a dismal fungus, it finds its first
\par expression in a paralysis of generous acts. The victim begins to shrink
\par spiritually; he develops a fancy for parlors with a regulated
\par temperature, and takes his morality on the principle of thin shoes and
\par tepid milk."
\par 
\par Then one night there came a tinkle in the temperature as of sleigh
\par bells. And the town, the world sank into a soft blanket of white. Were
\par you out then? Ah! you should have been. You were not, I hope, in a
\par parlor with a regulated temperature.
\par 
\par Well, anyhow, everybody else was out. The cross streets of the big city
\par had "all to oncet" taken on the air of a small town "sociable." Shadowy
\par multitudes seemed to sprout up out of the ground. The sidewalks,
\par especially those usually so deserted at this hour, now ahum with dark
\par busy bowing figures, rang and clanged gayly with the sound of scoop and
\par shovel. In the democratic, jovial, village-like spirit of the occasion,
\par many of the workers (those more staid and portly ones) removed their
\par coats. Every here and there an areaway held, in a holiday effect, a
\par cluster of bare-headed maid-servants--the "gallery" of the shovellers,
\par whose presence tended to make of the task of clearing the sidewalk a
\par night-hour lark.
\par 
\par Voices in the street, as you know, and laughter there, is never so
\par musical as above snow-stilled pavements. Then, too, cheery echoes are
\par abroad among the recesses between the houses, in the courts and down the
\par ways where packages are delivered. The shovellers good-naturedly banter
\par one another and pass a cordial jest with those who travel by. And every
\par here and there the rich contralto of negro mirth is heard.
\par 
\par I do not know that the city's parks are not a finer spectacle under snow
\par than in the summer--their dark glistening branches laden \'e0 la Christmas
\par card, and, after dark, their festoons of lamps more twinkling and more
\par yellow than at any other time.
\par 
\par Along Broadway what a whirl! The street like an arena, hordes of
\par gladiators in doughty combat with the onslaught of the storm, snow-carts
\par banging and backing about (horses seem to stomp and snort and rear more
\par in a snowstorm than at any other time), new ridiculously miniature
\par "caterpillar tractors" performing like toy tanks at war, traffic in a
\par hilarious tangle, street cars crawling along looking more than ever
\par before like prodigious cat-eyed bugs. Here with a terrific buzz comes
\par one all dark furiously thrashing the snow from side to side by means of
\par revolving brooms beneath. The crowds an animated silhouette against the
\par whitened air. One wants to hop and shout one feels so much alive.
\par 
\par Lots of funny things happen. A taxicab there has got stuck in a drift.
\par It whirs in a passion. Wallows forward. Runs its nose up a little
\par hillock of hard crusted snow. Stops. Makes a fine hubbub. Slides back,
\par stilled, exhausted. Tries again. Same thing repeated. A pounding is
\par heard on the inside of the door. Chauffeur reaches back his hand to turn
\par handle of door. Something is wrong. He climbs down. Pulls at door.
\par Nothing doing. Door has apparently been sprung somehow. Taxi is now
\par observed to be a bit listed to one side. Pounding, louder than before,
\par again heard from inside. Conductor from nearby car comes to side of
\par chauffeur. Also policeman. All lay hold of each other and pull with
\par united effort at taxi door. Door flies open. Closely knit group of
\par chauffeur, conductor and policeman nearly tumbles backward into snow.
\par From cab door descends tall, elegant figure in evening clothes and top
\par hat. Followed by even more elegant figure of slender lady in opera
\par cloak. For some reason she appears to be very angry, and shakes her fist
\par at her three humble liberators. The couple seek some path, from the
\par trampled oasis where they stand, through the drifts to the sidewalk.
\par There is none. Her dazzling skirt she has caught high from the mess
\par about her feet. Perhaps a yard of pale yellow silken hose is revealed
\par above her satin pumps. Finally in desperation the two plunge forward,
\par taking gigantic steps, sinking knee-deep at every onward move,
\par tottering, swaying and at length fairly scrambling toward the haven of
\par the curb. The dozens along the sidewalk who have been held spellbound by
\par what they have found to be so delicious a comedy turn to one another
\par with delighted smiles--and move along again on their way.
\par 
\par It is things like this always happening all about which make snow-storm
\par nights in the city such a hippodrome affair, and all the world akin.
\par 
\par Over on the Avenue busses are busily pushing plows hitched on before.
\par There one has got stalled in a drift. It whirs and buzzes and backs and
\par starts and whirs and buzzes over and over again. No use, it seems.
\par Still, draped along the curb, the spectators stand, unmindful of the
\par gale, as absorbed as if at a Yale-Princeton game.
\par Buzzzzzzzzz--Whirrrrrrrrrrr--and away. She's off! A feeble cheer goes
\par up. And everybody starts onward again in better humor with himself for
\par having seen so entertaining a show.
\par 
\par It snowed the night through.
\par 
\par In the morning banks of snow breast-high through the side streets.
\par Through a narrow aisle down the middle of the roadway trucks cars and
\par wagons slowly go in single file. Moving thus all in a single line they
\par have something the effect of a circus parade--elephants and lion cages
\par and so on.
\par 
\par And lions remind me. It is always well to look at public statues and
\par outdoor pieces of sculpture the morning after a heavy snow. You are
\par likely to find them very comical apparitions. The celebrated literary
\par lions before the New York Public Library, for instance, wore throughout
\par the day after the first big snow of this winter ridiculous tall caps
\par pulled down very rakishly over their eyes.
\par 
\par Streaming from the direction of the railroad station were coming the
\par swarms of our commuter friends, the legs of many of them hoisting along
\par those prodigious "arctics" which are all the vogue nowadays. Isn't it
\par curious? There was a time when if you were obliged to wear glasses you
\par got them as nearly invisible as possible. If you were a man you felt
\par there was something shameful about having "weak" eyes. If a woman, you
\par "just knew" that glasses made you look "horrid." And when you wore
\par overshoes you got them as inconspicuous as possible. Now you affect
\par shell spectacles that can be seen a block away, and having huge lenses.
\par Now there is nothing smarter, apparently, than for a young woman with a
\par trim foot to come into town swaddled in floppers which fit her slim
\par ankles like a bucket.
\par 
\par Men are still shovelling and scraping away at the streets, a motley
\par army. What is it so many persons are pausing to smile at, others
\par hurrying on but with grinning faces turned back? It is at a gentleman
\par shoveller. Here recruited somehow among this gang of husky laborers is a
\par slim eccentric figure in a--yes, a frock coat, a derby hat, kid gloves,
\par and very tight trousers ... a quaint picture of the shabby genteel.
\par Walking very briskly back and forth, very upright in carriage, the small
\par of his back curved inward, he pushes his scraper before him holding it
\par by the very tip of the long handle--and as well as can be observed
\par doesn't scrape anything at all. His fellow workers regard him with surly
\par disgust and roughly bump into him at every opportunity. What story is
\par there, in that absurd, pathetic scene, what O. Henry tale of mischance
\par in a great city?
\par 
\par A wagon on a side street has got its wheels ground into the snow bank at
\par the side of the narrow cleared way. Such accidents are all about, and
\par everywhere men may be seen leaving their own affairs to give a helping
\par hand to a fellow being in sore straits. The visitation of a great snow
\par storm strikingly unites the bonds of the brotherhood of man.
\par 
\par Stalled for interminable periods in suburban trains and in traffic jams
\par hurried men give themselves up cheerfully to the philosophic virtue of
\par patience.
\par 
\par Vagabonds sent on errands two miles away return after three hours with
\par tales of the awful slowness of trolley cars. And on days of great snow
\par storms meet with Christian forgiveness.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VII
\par 
\par THE UNUSUALNESS OF PARISIAN PHILADELPHIA
\par 
\par 
\par I discovered the other day that Philadelphia is a very great deal nearer
\par to Paris than New York is.
\par 
\par How do I figure out that?
\par 
\par Plain enough. It's because New York women, buds and matrons, thinking
\par they are got up (or as the English say, "turned out") smart as anything,
\par are parading around in fashions today altogether pass\'e9e.
\par 
\par You know the New York scene. And how for some considerable time now its
\par most--well, most apparent feature has been a--er, a hosiery display ...
\par unparalleled off the gay stage of musical comedy. Very, so to speak,
\par exhilarating that once was--the glistening spectacle of, moving all
\par about, those symmetrically tapering lines of pink and rose and orange
\par and pearl and taupe and heather tan and heather green and purple wool
\par and sheen of black and gloss of mottled snake and--and all that.
\par 
\par But, I am afraid, the eye over-long accustomed to the great Metropolitan
\par movie thriller of the fashionable streets had become somewhat dulled.
\par 
\par The Parisienne knew about the peculiar character of the eye, and that it
\par ceases to see with any emotional response at all that which remains
\par within its range of vision for any extended length of time. So she
\par (roguish witch!) alertly changed the picture.
\par 
\par I picked up by chance, during my two-hour run on the train, a copy of
\par one of our most dashing fashion journals. It was the "Forecast of Spring
\par Fashions" number. I opened it, at random, at the headline: "The Short
\par Skirt Has Had Its Day in Paris." Below was a jolly photograph (of a
\par stunning lady at the latest races at Auteuil) illustrating "the new
\par skirt length." Visible beneath the hem--a trim foot, and a bit of tidy
\par ankle.
\par 
\par Who was the fellow (with a gifted eye for the lasses) who spoke with
\par such delight of the tiny feet that "like little mice run in and out"?
\par And there was that other poet (what was his name? I declare! my
\par literature is getting awful rusty), who sang with such relish the charm
\par of feminine drapery "concealing yet revealing." Anyhow, you know what
\par I'm getting at.
\par 
\par I closed the magazine and forgot about the matter--until shortly after I
\par had come out of the Broad Street Station.
\par 
\par The modish scene I apprehended was, to an eye accustomed steadily for
\par some time to the natty abbreviations of Fifth Avenue, a refreshing, a
\par charming spectacle. I seemed suddenly to have left my "orchestra seat."
\par And to have returned again to a view of, so to put it, ladies in private
\par life.
\par 
\par Though, indeed, occasionally in the distance I caught a flashing glimpse
\par of, according to Paris decree, the obsolete skirt length.
\par 
\par Come to think of it, isn't this so, too: that there are in Philadelphia
\par more rose-cheeked damsels of hearty figure and athletic-heel swing than
\par you usually come across in other cities?
\par 
\par At any rate, there are quite a number of very unusual things about
\par "Phila," as I believe intimate friends of the city affectionately call
\par the place. Things which it may be you have not noticed lately--perhaps
\par because you haven't been there recently, or maybe because you live
\par there, and so see them every day.
\par 
\par One of the unusual things about Philadelphia is that so many ladies and
\par "gem'men" who do light housekeeping on and around Manhattan Island (in
\par other words "New Yorkers") apparently find it easier frequently to get
\par to Chicago, or Palm Beach, or London, or Santa Barbara than to journey
\par to Philadelphia. I suppose the reason for this state of mind is the same
\par as the cause of my sometimes feeling that it would be about as simple
\par for me to undertake a trip from the Grand Central to Buffalo as to get
\par from Times Square down to Fulton Street for a luncheon appointment. A
\par place which is only half an hour, or two hours away, is a place, you
\par think, that you can run down to any time. And--well, just at the moment
\par with everything so pressing and all that. To become keyed up about
\par taking a "real" trip is another matter.
\par 
\par And when I myself do get there I always feel that it is an unusual thing
\par that I have allowed so long a time to lapse since I came before. Because
\par it is so unusually pleasant and restful a ride that it makes me sore to
\par think what an unusually deuce of a thing I am put to every night going
\par home in the rush hour to Dyckman Street on the subway.
\par 
\par It is an unusual thing (or, at least, so it seems to me) that in
\par Philadelphia cards in windows advertising rooms to let should be (as
\par they are) labelled "Vacancies."
\par 
\par It is an unusual thing that here so many undertakers' shops should be
\par conducted in what appear to be private residences. It is an unusual
\par thing that there should be so many ways of paying your fare on the
\par street cars--in some you pay when you get on, in others when you get
\par off. It is an unusual thing that in Philadelphia there are more
\par different kinds of street lamps than (I suspect) there are in any other
\par city in the world. There are powerful arc lamps, high on tall poles,
\par cold white in their light. There are lower down, particularly pleasant
\par in the twinkle of their numbers in Washington Square, gas lamps glowing
\par a mellow yellow through their mantles. Various other kinds of lamps,
\par too. But the ones I like best are those squat fellows throughout
\par Independence Square. Octagonal iron-bound boxes of glass, small at the
\par base, wide at the top, with a kind of ecclesiastical derby hat of iron
\par as a lid. They somehow suggest to me the lamps which I fancy before Will
\par Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.
\par 
\par Here golden Diana with her bow does not poise high on her slender
\par Spanish tower. But from far above the "Public Buildings" Brother Penn
\par looks down on more banks, United States Mints, trust companies, firms
\par dealing in securities, places handling investments, and such-like
\par business concerns than (one has a feeling) can be found in any other
\par city in Christendom. There are too, I should guess, in Philadelphia
\par about as many different styles and periods of architecture as in any
\par other municipality between the two great seas: Georgian, Colonial,
\par bay-window, London brick row, ramshackle frame, modern mansion,
\par skyscraper, etc., etc., etc. And certainly I don't know where one could
\par go to count more different kinds of porches. Nor where one could find so
\par many such pleasant oddities of today as hitching-blocks, doorway
\par foot-scrapers, and those old friends of our childhood the front yard
\par stone storks.
\par 
\par And where, Oh, where! (not even in London) can one find so many alleys
\par to the square inch? Many of them, lanes of but a few blocks in length,
\par highly respectable, even aristocratic, quarters of the town. Such as
\par Camac Street, tucked away between Thirteenth and Twelfth Streets, one
\par block of it either side of Locust, and the home or haunt of those of
\par artistic persuasion. Here the famous Franklin Inn Club, the charming
\par Poor Richard Club, and divers other clubs of kindred spirit. Unusual
\par this quaint street of art in this: in fixing it up for its present
\par purpose its quaintness and its "artiness" have not been overdone. Far,
\par far finer in effect than New York's over eccentric alley of painters,
\par Washington Mews, its original loveliness has simply been restored. It is
\par as jolly to look upon as London's artist nook, Cheyne Row. Perhaps even
\par jollier.
\par 
\par Now another unusual thing about Philadelphia is that Philadelphians
\par standing within three blocks of the place can't tell you where South
\par Carlisle Street is. Professional Philadelphians, such as policemen,
\par firemen, postmen, street car men, can't do it. In the attempt they
\par contradict each other, and quarrel among themselves. For the benefit of
\par both Philadelphians and visitors to the city I will set down here
\par exactly the location of South Carlisle Street. West of Broad, south of
\par Pine, it runs one block from Pine to Lombard Street. After a jump, where
\par there isn't any of it, north of Market Street there is more of it.
\par 
\par But what the dickens is South Carlisle Street, and why should anybody
\par care where it is? Well, though it isn't in the books on Historic Shrines
\par of America it is a street you "hadn't ought to" miss. It's about twelve
\par feet (or something like that) from wall to wall. The doorways seem to be
\par about three feet wide. There, in South Carlisle Street, Philadelphia's
\par mahogany doors, fan-lights above, white pillars before, marble steps
\par below, her immaculate red brick, her freshly painted wooden shutters,
\par her gleaming brass knockers are in their most exquisite perfection.
\par 
\par A wealthy and cultivated gentleman or two "took up" the street a year or
\par so ago, decided to make their homes there, and it has become quite
\par "class." Same idea, more or less, that Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt has
\par concerning the "exodus" of her set from Fifth Avenue to unheard-of
\par Sutton Place over among the tall yellow chimneys by New York's East
\par River.
\par 
\par Considering the great wealth in Philadelphia and its environs,
\par particularly those patrician environs lying toward Harrisburg, it is, I
\par think, unusual that you never see on the streets there a Pekingese or a
\par Pomeranian attended by a personage in livery.
\par 
\par Unusual, too, that in a city of the first class along the eastern
\par seaboard so few canes are "worn."
\par 
\par And, by the way, that's an unusual railroad service from Philadelphia to
\par New York. Conductor calls out: "Train for Newark and New York. Newark
\par first stop." Train slides a few feet--halts at West Philadelphia. Spins
\par along a bit again, and pulls up at North Philadelphia. Stops later along
\par the way at Trenton, Newark, and Manhattan Junction. I really do not see,
\par putting a wreck out of the calculation, where else it could stop.
\par 
\par I took from a boy in the Pennsylvania station a copy of one of New
\par York's most popular evening papers. It came apart in the middle.
\par Straightening it out, I caught a headline on the "Talks to Women" page.
\par It read "Short Skirts Remain." Below a cut of a beaming lass attired,
\par the caption said, in "frock of navy blue ruffled taffeta with short
\par sleeves and 'shorter' skirt."
\par 
\par When I came out onto the street the temperature (in skirts) seemed to
\par have risen since my departure a couple of days before.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VIII
\par 
\par OUR LAST SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AS A FINE ART
\par 
\par 
\par I have just witnessed a revelation. At least, it was a revelation to me.
\par I'm keen on telling you all about it.
\par 
\par One of my earlier articles in this series had to do with the
\par establishment here and there in a great city of those gentlemen engaged
\par in the estimable business of packing you up for keeps--that is the
\par "parlors" of various sorts of "undertakers." I had been much struck by
\par the vast number of cozy little places catering, so to say, to the poor
\par and humble who have forever (as Stevenson puts it) "parted company with
\par their aches and ecstasies." And I had wondered at how very few places
\par there were in evidence on the streets to take care of the "remains" of,
\par in a manner of speaking, the first-cabin passengers in life, those who
\par have travelled through their days in a fashion de luxe. The
\par establishments of this type which now and then I did see were very
\par palatial indeed--and didn't look at all as though they would
\par countenance the corpse of just an ordinary person such as you and me.
\par 
\par Also, all the undertaking establishments visible to me in my goings and
\par comings about town were quite obviously undertaking establishments. They
\par displayed within and without the air, the accoutrements, the
\par paraphernalia traditionally associated with one's last social engagement
\par on earth, his funeral. They varied only in this: some were rich and
\par haughty in general effect, others simple and perhaps dingy in
\par appearance. But each and all of them looked as much like an undertaking
\par shop as a barber shop looks like a barber shop. You could not possibly
\par have mistaken any one of them for a Turkish bath establishment, or a
\par Carnegie library, or an office for steamship tickets.
\par 
\par As I say, I wrote that article telling all this and that about what
\par anybody may see any day as he goes about on his rounds through the thick
\par of the city. But when the article appeared--originally--it soon
\par developed that I was not abreast of undertaking matters at all. I had
\par not in the least kept track of the remarkable advances which have to
\par date been made in the art of being buried--and a very fine art, in the
\par advanced phases of the affair, it certainly has become. I did not even
\par know the present-day, the correct, name for what I, in so old-fashioned
\par a condition of mind, called an "undertaker's." No.
\par 
\par That word, "undertaker," has long, long ago been discarded by the \'e9lite
\par of the profession. What a queer word as a business title it was, anyway!
\par How did it originally ever come to be used in its mortuary relation? No
\par one in the business that I have asked has been able to tell me. And why
\par in the dim past when names were being given to trades did not this word,
\par undertaker, seem to be equally descriptive of the career of physician or
\par attorney? Indeed, does not he that sets himself the highly hazardous
\par task of saving a living fellow being from disease or the gallows
\par undertake to do more than he who merely performs the quiet office of
\par laying us away?
\par 
\par And then, oddly enough for its tragic associations, the word acquired in
\par our minds something of a ludicrous turn. It was reminiscent of Dickens,
\par of hired professional "mourners," and that sort of thing. At mention of
\par the word, a picture popped into our mind of a grotesquely angular being,
\par of sallow, elongated features and lugubrious manner, garbed in a rusty
\par frock coat and "stove pipe" hat, who put together before him the tips of
\par black-gloved fingers and spoke with a hollow sound. We would say to our
\par friends when they were feeling blue: "What's the matter with you? You
\par act like an undertaker."
\par 
\par Well, as doubtless you have noticed, the term "funeral director" more or
\par less recently pretty well superseded the word undertaker among
\par progressive concerns. It is a phrase much more in the modern spirit,
\par like "domestic science" for (what used to be) "household work,"
\par "modiste" for "dressmaker," "maid" for "hired-girl," "psychic" for
\par "fortune teller," "publicity engineer" for "press agent," and so on. And
\par it has a good, business-like, efficient sound.
\par 
\par Still (I discovered) to be buried by a funeral director is not the very
\par latest, the most fashionable thing. The really smart way nowadays of
\par bidding good-bye to the world is to go to the establishment of a
\par "mortician."
\par 
\par Yes; that's what the gentleman said in his very cordial letter: would I
\par care to look over a "real mortician's establishment in New York City?" I
\par replied that nothing could give me greater pleasure. So at the time
\par appointed a couple of days later his car came round for me.
\par 
\par When I told people of the visit I was about to make, they all laughed,
\par very heartily. Now that brings to one's attention a curious thing: why
\par should they laugh? Honestly, between you and me, think hard and tell me
\par what really there is funny about going to see a burial establishment?
\par 
\par Paradoxical indeed is the attitude of mind of practically everyone
\par toward this subject of being ushered out of life. Sundry totally
\par contradictory emotions are aroused in the very same person by slightly
\par different aspects of the same subject. If you remark that you are going
\par to spend the afternoon at the undertaker's that is awfully amusing. At
\par the same time, is not nearly everyone down in his heart a bit scared of
\par undertakers' shops? Uncomfortable, gruesome places, would not most of us
\par feel, to have next door?
\par 
\par At any rate, as we glided along I was told by the gentleman who had come
\par to fetch me that the feeling was very general that the presence of a
\par funeral director's establishment depreciated the value of property in
\par the immediate neighborhood. Though, he asserted, this popular idea
\par frequently had not at all been borne out in fact.
\par 
\par It developed (from his lively conversation) that nothing so much annoys
\par a funeral director, or a mortician, as for a visitor to pull old gags
\par which he thinks are smart--such, for instance, as the remark: "I see
\par your business is pretty dead." I gathered that this jocular pleasantry
\par was the stock joke of all near-wits who visited undertakers--I mean
\par morticians.
\par 
\par No; there is another thing which annoys these gentlemen (morticians)
\par even more than such punk puns as that. They deeply resent, I discovered,
\par any disrespectful allusion to their silent clients, such as calling them
\par "stiffs," or something like that. How would you, they ask, like to have
\par someone of yours--someone who but yesterday returned your heart's clasp,
\par now dumb and cold--made game of by such ribaldry? Certainly, I cannot
\par say that I should like it.
\par 
\par Another paradoxical contradiction! Tell me (if you can) what strange
\par spring of his being prompts a man to think it big and bold and hearty of
\par him to speak with such cynical contemptuousness of a fellow man returned
\par to rigid clay.
\par 
\par We had arrived at our destination, I was told. But I saw nothing, but
\par what was (seemingly) a rather handsome private residence, set in a
\par pleasant lawn. Though I did discern by the door a modest plate which
\par read (as I recall the name) "Wentworth Brothers," nothing more.
\par Wentworth Brothers might have been, for all the exterior evidence to the
\par contrary, architects, or teachers of dancing and the piano, or breeders
\par of pedigreed dogs, or dealers in antiques, or physical instructors, or
\par almost anything you please.
\par 
\par This I soon learned was the fundamental principle of the sensitive art
\par of the mortician--to scrap all the old stage properties of the bugaboo
\par type of undertaker.
\par 
\par We passed into a charming hall, light and cheerful, furnished in
\par excellent taste, altogether domestic in effect. A number of bright
\par looking people, apparently attached to the premises, were lightly moving
\par about. I had somewhat the sensation of having come to a most agreeable
\par afternoon tea.
\par 
\par I was presented to my host, as cheerful, wholesome and cordial a young
\par chap as anyone would care anywhere to see. The senior, he, of the
\par brothers. I had been a little depressed that morning, having a bad cold
\par and being fretted by a number of gloomy things, but as we proceeded
\par through the house my spirits picked up decidedly. I experienced a
\par feeling of mental and physical well-being, so attractive was everything
\par about.
\par 
\par A dainty reception room opened off the hall at the front. My impression
\par was of a nice amount of charming Colonial furniture. Altogether such a
\par room as you might see in an illustration in the magazine _House and
\par Garden_. Secluded back of this rooms having a brisk atmosphere and
\par serving as offices. Peopled by very trim and efficient looking young
\par people.
\par 
\par We descended to the "stock room," a most sanitary looking place of
\par cement floor, ceiling and walls, where was a large store of caskets of
\par many varieties. Behind this a spick and span embalming room which
\par (except for the two tables) somewhat suggested an admirable creamery.
\par Here I discovered that to the mind of the mortician towels belong to the
\par Dark Ages. The up-to-date way of drying hands is by holding them before
\par a blast of air turned on from a pipe.
\par 
\par We ascended to the third floor. Here were the chapels, rooms which might
\par have been designed to accommodate fashionable audiences attending
\par literary lectures. In connection with them a tiny "minister's study,"
\par not unlike the sanctum of a university professor. Also here small hotel
\par suites, each with bath attached, available for the bereaved from out of
\par town. Here, too, snug quarters for wakes. And a spacious chamber wherein
\par friends may sit for a little last visit with the departed. The dominant
\par article of furniture in this room an Empire lounge such as we see
\par supporting the figure of Madame R\'e9camier in the famous portrait by
\par David. A consummate refinement was shown me on this floor: telephones,
\par concealed behind panels in the wall, with no bells to jangle over-tried
\par nerves, but with a tiny red electric globe on the wall to light as the
\par signal.
\par 
\par The top floor a dormitory for male employees, having much the effect of
\par rooms for boys at college, gay soft cushions, pipes and mandolins
\par scattered about.
\par 
\par I lingered for a smoke and a chat with my host on the ground floor in an
\par oak panelled room like the library of a gentleman's club before leaving.
\par 
\par I came away with (I very much fear) an idea that I should like to go
\par back tomorrow and see some one of my friends so agreeably buried from
\par that place.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER IX
\par 
\par WRITING IN ROOMS
\par 
\par 
\par I remember that I was somewhat surprised when E. V. Lucas expressed
\par surprise that I was writing in my room at the hotel where we both
\par happened to be at the same time for several days last summer. He
\par declared with an expression of sharp distaste that he could not write in
\par hotel rooms. But said he had no difficulty in writing on trains. That
\par rather got me, because I can't write at all on trains. And possibly
\par because I was a bit peeved at the easy way in which he spoke of doing
\par that exceedingly difficult thing, writing on trains, I asserted in reply
\par that anybody ought to be able to write in _any kind_ of a room. But I do
\par know, what every writer knows, that the particular room one may be in
\par can make a good deal of difference in the way one is able to write.
\par 
\par Of course, it does appear to be true that there are writers of a kind
\par that can write anywhere in any circumstances, apparently with equal
\par facility and their customary standard of merit, whatever that may be. I
\par suppose war correspondents must be like that, and reporters for daily
\par newspapers. We know that a good many war books were announced as having
\par been written in dugouts, trenches, pill-boxes, tanks, submarines,
\par hospitals, airplanes and so on. In the matter of some of them I should
\par not undertake to dispute that they had even been written in asylums.
\par 
\par I have known, and known well, men of that type of mind which seemed to
\par be so completely under control that at will it could be turned on or
\par off, so to say, like the stream from a water faucet. My friend Joyce
\par Kilmer had such a head. It has been told how some of his most moving
\par poems--for one instance "The White Ships and the Red"--were the result
\par of hurried newspaper assignments: how he could leave a poem in the
\par middle of its composition, go out and lunch heartily for two hours,
\par return and finish the writing of it; how early in his career he would
\par walk up and down a room of his home in suburban New Jersey at two in the
\par morning and dictate (without a pause) to his wife while carrying a
\par shrilly crying child in his arms; how one of the best of his "Sunday
\par stories" was dictated directly after having been taken to a hospital
\par with three ribs fractured by being hit by his commutation train--and how
\par much more. A young man with a brain in perfect practical working
\par condition. But even he was not free from the mysterious tricks of
\par creative writing. For we know that after a daily round sustained for a
\par number of years of high productivity, when he went into the war, which
\par inspired countless others to _begin_ writing, he suddenly ceased to
\par write, practically altogether.
\par 
\par Poets and trains being up, brings to my mind my friend the Reverend
\par Edward F. Garesch\'e9, S. J., a source of amusement to many of his friends
\par because of his method of composition. He travels continually. Frequently
\par he will excuse himself from a group with whom he is talking, go to his
\par own seat, request the porter to bring him a card table, get out his
\par travelling typewriter, rattle off several poems, return to his party and
\par resume conversation at about where he had left off. Some of his poems
\par are very good; some (I'm sorry to have to say) are--not so good.
\par 
\par And so round we come again to the matter of writing in rooms. We know
\par how Booth Tarkington writes: in what he calls a "work spree," in a room
\par upstairs at home, a pile of freshly sharpened pencils ready to his
\par hand--and that, doubtless, he wouldn't be able to write anything in an
\par office if he were to be hanged for not doing it. (Probably never goes to
\par an office.) Meredith Nicholson, on the other hand, declares that the
\par only way it is possible for him to write is to go regularly at nine
\par o'clock every morning to an office he has downtown; where he tells
\par anyone who may ask over the telephone that he'll be there until five in
\par the afternoon.
\par 
\par There are persons who like to have others around them, moving about,
\par while they write. And people there are who find it necessary to lock
\par themselves up, and can have no one else in the room. Though in some
\par cases such persons would not mind the bang of a bass-drum just the other
\par side of the door. I know a man who had an office in lower Manhattan
\par where for a considerable period just outside his open window a steam
\par riveter was at work. Terrific it was, the way the noise of this machine
\par smashed the air into tiny particles like a shower of broken glass.
\par Callers who found this man contentedly writing would hold their ears and
\par look at him with their hair on end from amazement. A man of highly
\par nervous organism, too; one who would be very upset if his typewriter had
\par a pale ribbon, or be spoiled for the day if he couldn't find the right
\par pen--worn over just to his liking at the point. But, after the first day
\par or so, Mr. Soaping (name of the gentleman I'm telling you about) I know
\par didn't hear the riveter at all.
\par 
\par Then those exist, Royal Cortissoz is one, who, dictating all they do,
\par can have in the room while they work only their secretary. Frequently is
\par it the case, too, that none but the amanuensis to whom they have been
\par long accustomed will do. A stranger throws 'em completely off. A
\par novelist I know, the writer of a very good style, who becomes very much
\par fussed up, and is practically destroyed, when he suspects a secretary of
\par giving critical attention to the manner of his prose. An embarrassing
\par thing about most stenographers, I have found, is that they are greatly
\par grieved if you say "'em" for "them," or anything like that. Or else they
\par won't let you do such things at all, and edit everything pleasant back
\par into perfectly good copy-book English. Some of them won't even let you
\par split an infinitive.
\par 
\par Who was it, Voltaire, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, somebody, who could
\par write only when elaborately got up in his satins and ruffles? It is what
\par not long ago was called a bromidium to say that humorists are sad
\par people. I'd probably be thought humorous if I should call myself any
\par particular flier as a humorist, but this I know: wherever in my writing
\par I may have approached being amusing that generally was written when I
\par was considerably depressed. Forenoon is the best time for some to write;
\par late at night for others. "Ben Hur," I seem to recall, was penned
\par beneath a noble tree. At any rate, we frequently see pictures of
\par novelists, particularly in England, at work in their gardens. The most
\par familiar photographs, etchings, medallions and so on of Mark Twain and
\par of Robert Louis Stevenson at work are those of them writing in bed. Now
\par I can't (as some so take their breakfast) eat in bed; and I'm quite sure
\par I should never be able comfortably to write anything there. I do not
\par tell you how it is with me because I regard it as of deep interest to
\par you to hear how it is with me, but merely to aid me in assembling a
\par collection of facts concerning the freakishness of writing, and to
\par suggest to you how very different it may be with _you_.
\par 
\par And I couldn't write under a tree. One writer, perhaps, writes more
\par easily in the winter than in the summer, or it is the other way round.
\par The mind of one, it may be, is stimulated by the companionship of an
\par open fire, and that of another (for aught I know) by the companionship
\par of an ice-box. Personally, I think that it is well in writing for the
\par weather to be cool enough to have the windows down; and that night is
\par the best time, for the reason that your mind (or, at least, my mind) is
\par more gathered together within the circle of light at your desk.
\par 
\par Frequently, however (as you know), after sitting for hours with your
\par mind plumb stalled, it is not until shortly before your bed time that
\par that eccentric engine, your brain, gets buzzed up. Then, probably, you
\par can't call the thing off if you want to. I will tell you a story:
\par 
\par A man there is, of some renown as a writer, who started a new book early
\par last spring. For some considerable time he had been much discouraged
\par about his writing. Hadn't been able to make it go. Could only lift
\par heavily and painfully one stilted sentence after another. Used to take
\par up now and then one or another of his early books and look into it.
\par Marvelled how it was that he ever could have written such clever stuff.
\par Like Swift when late in life he re-read "Gulliver," so did this man
\par exclaim: "What a genius I had at that time!" He felt that the fire had
\par gone out; his inner life seemed to have completely died; he was a hollow
\par shell; could now neither receive nor impart anything worth half a
\par jews-harp. When, one day, he heard rosy, young Hugh Walpole say of
\par himself that of course what he had written was merely a beginning to
\par what he felt he might do, this man looked at rosy, young Hugh Walpole
\par with a deeply gloomy and very jealous eye.
\par 
\par But, lo! as I say, this man started this new book. It began as a series
\par of articles for which he was to be paid--that was _why_ it was begun at
\par all. Now see! With him it was as Professor George Edward Woodberry says
\par of Poe in his admirable "Life"--for a time his genius had "slept." With
\par the start of the new book he awoke. It began to run right out of the
\par ends of his fingers. Took (that book) hold of him completely. He
\par couldn't leave it. Go to bed, have to get up and go at it again. Try to
\par go out for a round of exercise. After a block or so from his quarters,
\par walk slower and slower. Miserable. Tortured. Turn back. Immediately
\par happy again. Soon be back at work. Anybody who entangled him with an
\par invitation anywhere enraged him beyond measure.
\par 
\par New book finished. Everything fine. Got another commission. Easy enough
\par job. Set to at it. Empty vessel again! In despair. He'd make all sorts
\par of excuses to himself to leave his place early in the morning to
\par postpone beginning work. He'd go anywhere, with anybody, to keep as long
\par as possible from facing that task again. Couldn't give any sensible
\par explanation of his prolonged delay to the publishers. Kept putting them
\par off again and again, with one cripple-legged excuse after another, in
\par the hope that he'd come round. Matter became a disgrace.
\par 
\par Still queerer cases than that I know. Fellow who shared an apartment
\par with me one time. When according to the accepted law of nature his mind
\par should have been in a very bad way, then always was he at his best.
\par After leading a regular, wholesome life for a period his mind would
\par become dull, stale and unprofitable. When, following a very different
\par sort of period, he should in all reason have awakened with a splitting
\par head, a swollen eye and a shaking hand, he would get up at about dawn
\par one morning in rattling fine spirits, his mind as clear as a bell, and
\par with an impassioned desire to work. Could, then, write like a streak.
\par But doesn't William James touch upon such a matter as this somewhere?
\par 
\par And Stevenson, how wrong he got the thing! What is it he tells us as to
\par the years of apprenticeship to writing:
\par 
\par      It is only after years of such gymnastic that one can sit down at
\par      last, legions of words swarming to his call, dozens of turns of
\par      phrase simultaneously bidding for his choice, and he himself
\par      knowing what he wants to do and (within the narrow limit of a man's
\par      ability) able to do it.
\par 
\par Only last night it was I was talking to Jesse Lynch Williams. He said
\par nothing of "legions of words swarming to his call," nary a mention of
\par "dozens of turns of phrase simultaneously bidding for his choice."
\par Instead, he asked if I found that writing came easier as time went on.
\par No, he said, it seemed to him that writing became harder and harder the
\par longer one wrote. That he had torn up everything he had done for a long
\par while.
\par 
\par Always the paradox! Again, there are men who write with astonishing
\par ease, or at least with astonishing rapidity, and write well. Not so long
\par ago I began a novel in collaboration with a writer known and admired
\par from coast to coast, a frequent contributor to _The Bookman_, and one of
\par the best. We were to do this thing turn and turn about, a chapter by me,
\par then a chapter by him, and so on. For something like ten days I toiled
\par over chapter one. I labored and I groaned. When it was finished I was
\par spent. I handed him the manuscript; he stuffed it into his overcoat
\par pocket and went whistling away. Returned within a few days and handed me
\par a wad of copy covering, I think, three chapters. Again I toiled in the
\par sweat of my brow. Gave him another chapter. When, after a couple of
\par weeks or something like that, he returned and I had read what he had
\par done I discovered that he had got people married that I hadn't known
\par were yet born. The collaboration busted up.
\par 
\par My excellent friend does not like me to tell this story, because he
\par thinks it represents me as the conscientious artist and him as the
\par shallow scribbler. Well, that was not so; his chapters were far better
\par than mine. Nevertheless, his name I shall not give; I'll merely say
\par that it has very much the sound of a name borne by one of the
\par Elizabethan dramatists.
\par 
\par Then there is that sort of human head-piece which can only write when it
\par absolutely has to. I allude to the magical instrument of coercion known
\par as a "copy date." I know people, dozens of them, who having a month and
\par a half ahead of them in which to do an article can't possibly get
\par started on it until it is almost too late for them to get it in on time
\par to go to press--when a mad frenzy seizes them, their indolence vanishes
\par like mist before the rising sun, their minds open like a flower, and all
\par is well.
\par 
\par And the "galley slaves," those poor devils who for years have lived
\par under the whip of copy day every day. How they dream of the "real"
\par things they might do, given time. If (they think) the Lord would only
\par subsidize them! Now and then the Devil takes one of them and does this
\par very thing. The happy man gets some sort of a sinecure. All he has to do
\par is to go write. And (in all probability) that's all there is to that
\par story. He is like those things Riley tells about who "swaller
\par theirselves." He gets nothing written.
\par 
\par What do you write with? And why do you write with whatever it is you
\par write with instead of with something else? Why did Mr. Howells (in all
\par the writing of his which I have seen) use a script-letter typewriter
\par instead of a Roman-letter machine? Why does Mr. Le Gallienne do so much
\par of his copy (if not all of it) by hand? Why is it that Mr. Huneker could
\par never either dictate or learn to run a typewriter? How is it possible
\par for those Englishmen--Swinnerton and Bennett, for instance--to put forth
\par in a few months whole novels in the monkish hand of an illuminated
\par missal? (I have seen the original manuscript of "The Old Wives' Tale,"
\par every page like a copper-plate engraving, and hardly a correction
\par throughout.) And why is that it seems to me most natural to write some
\par things with a pen, others with a pencil, most things on a typewriter,
\par and yet again mix the use of all three implements in one composition? I
\par cannot tell you.
\par 
\par Some authors, if they are going to write about a slum, have to go and
\par live in a slum while they are writing about a slum. Other authors, if
\par they are going to write about life in an Ohio town, go to Italy to write
\par about life in an Ohio town. In his excellent book "On the Trail of
\par Stevenson" Clayton Hamilton says:
\par 
\par      Throughout his lifelong wanderings, Stevenson rarely or never
\par      attempted to describe a place so long as he was in it. For his
\par      selection of descriptive detail he relied always on the
\par      subconscious artistry of memory. He trusted his own mind to forget
\par      the non-essential; and he seized upon whatever he remembered as, by
\par      that token, the most essential features of a scene--the features,
\par      therefore, that cried out to be selected as the focal points of the
\par      picture to be suggested to the mind's eye of his readers.
\par 
\par The author of the thirteen volumes known as "The Chronicles of
\par Barsetshire," a detailed picture of the English clergy of his time, had
\par never associated with bishops, deans, and arch-deacons; he built them up
\par (to use his own expression) out of his "moral consciousness."
\par 
\par But round to rooms again. Often has it been told how Anthony Trollope
\par worked. How he accomplished so much--thirty-odd novels besides as many
\par tales--by a method he recommended to all who wish to pursue successfully
\par the literary career. In the drawing room of the Athen\'e6um Club, in a
\par railway carriage, or on the ocean, wherever he might be he seated
\par himself for three hours as a limit, with his watch before him; and
\par regularly as it marked the quarter hour he turned off two hundred and
\par fifty words, undisturbed by any distraction about him. We know that the
\par unlettered man of genius, John Bunyan, wrote his immortal allegory "The
\par Pilgrim's Progress" in Bedford jail. And there is being advertised now a
\par book recently written in an American prison. And much writing has been
\par done in garrets. Then here's our old friend George Moore. Again and
\par again he has told of exactly the places it was necessary for him to live
\par in while he wrote certain books. I open at random "Ave"; and I find
\par this:
\par 
\par      I descended the hillside towards the loveliest prospect that ever
\par      greeted mortal eyes.... And I walked thinking if there were one
\par      among my friends who would restore Mount Venus sufficiently for the
\par      summer months, long enough for me to write my book.
\par 
\par Now, to be quite frank with you, I didn't intend to write this paper at
\par all. You may remember that when I set out I was merely in disagreement
\par with Mr. Lucas concerning the matter of writing in a hotel room. One
\par thing (as it will) led to another; and the upshot has been all this
\par pother. However, there are, I hope, no bones broken--and that's saying a
\par good deal for any kind of a discussion in these unsettled times.
\par 
\par What I am coming to is (the fashionable thing to come to nowadays) the
\par psychic. A fellow I know was much puzzled. He recently got back to 16
\par Gramercy Park from a trip around the world. I saw him there having some
\par toast and a pot of tea. He told me these interesting circumstances. He
\par would be at a superbly appointed hotel in some city. Beautiful suite of
\par rooms. Commodious bath-room with lovely bay-window. Everything to make
\par for perfect mental and physical well-being. Impotent to write there.
\par Later runs into some terrible dump of a lodging house. Horrible din of
\par low noises all about. One dirty window looks out on scene of squalor. So
\par cold at night has to put chair on bed and sit there to be nearer gas
\par jet. Gets on wonderfully with writing. Strikes another place, handsomest
\par of all; writes pretty well. Comes to most fearful place yet; can't write
\par at all.
\par 
\par Couldn't make head nor tail of the matter, this fellow. Discussed the
\par thing with many people. Finally found young woman who gave convincing
\par explanation. It's like this: Undoubtedly you are, in any room, affected
\par by something of the spirit which lingers there of former occupants.
\par Maybe they were persons, whatever their station in life, sympathetic to
\par your spirit--maybe not.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER X
\par 
\par TAKING THE AIR IN SAN FRANCISCO
\par 
\par 
\par A few days ago, in the warm and brilliant winter sunlight there, I was
\par strolling along the Embarcadero. Now all my life I have been very fond
\par of roving the streets....
\par 
\par And that confession reminds me:
\par 
\par I one time heard a minister (a clergyman of considerable force of
\par eloquence) preach a sermon against streets. His idea seemed to be that
\par streets were not good for one--that they were very bad places. He
\par admonished mothers to keep their children "off the streets." He regarded
\par it as very reprehensible in a wife for her to "gad the streets." The
\par footpad (he said) plied the street at night, while the righteous were at
\par home in bed. What so sad as "a child of the streets"? If we wished to
\par describe a worthless canine we called it a "street dog." The outcast has
\par his home in the streets. The drunkard makes his bed in the street. It
\par was painful (I gathered) for a civilized being to hear the "language of
\par the street." And so on.
\par 
\par But I very much fear that the eloquence of this gentleman was greater
\par than his Christianity. If we are to love our neighbors as we do
\par ourselves, we will find him in greatest variety in the streets. If we
\par are to give away our cloak, the beneficiary, I should think, would be a
\par citizen much accustomed to the streets. And, as far as I can make out,
\par there is more rejoicing in heaven over the arrival of a sister who has
\par "walked the streets" than attends the reception of a nun.
\par 
\par Certainly I admit that roaming the streets (like everything else) can
\par doubtless be overdone. Nevertheless, to most people, people of ordinary
\par ways of life (like myself), I highly recommend the practice, as a most
\par healthful exercise, as a pleasant course of profitable education, as a
\par source of endless amusement, and as a Christian virtue. The trouble, I
\par think, with most of us is not that we see too much of the streets but
\par that we do not see as well as we might the streets we happen to be on.
\par We do not read as we run.
\par 
\par So I would write an article In Praise of Streets.
\par 
\par As I was saying (when that minister switched me off), I was strolling
\par along the Embarcadero. Among all the different sorts of streets there
\par are none I think more beguiling than those which lie along the water
\par front of a town or a city. The water-front streets of all seaport
\par cities, of course, partake very much of the same character. Particularly
\par in the picturesque aspect of the shop windows.
\par 
\par Here along the rim of San Francisco Bay you pass the sparkling pier
\par buildings (now and then of Spanish mission architecture) of the Toyo
\par Kisen Kaisha Oriental S. S. Co., of the American Hawaiian S. S. Co., the
\par Kosmos Line, and the Pacific-Alaska Navigation Co., among others. While
\par on New York's West Street you see the structures of the White Star Line,
\par the Cunard Line, the Red Star Line, erected in masonry of a sort of
\par mammoth and glorified garage architecture, funnels and masts peeping
\par over the top; and further down the frame sheds of the Morgan Line, the
\par Clyde Steam Ship Company, Savannah Line, Lackawanna Rail Road, Hoboken
\par Ferry, and so on. But the tastes of the sailor man as a shopper appear
\par to be very much the same whether he is along the London docks, on West
\par Street, by Boston piers or here on the Embarcadero. In this the West
\par and the East do meet.
\par 
\par The \'e6sthetic taste of the water front inclines, very decidedly, to the
\par ornate. As (presumably) a present to a lady and a decoration for the
\par home the favorite object seems to be a heavy china plate. A romantic
\par landscape, or a moonlight scene, or perhaps a still life study of portly
\par roses is "hand painted" in very thick pigment on its face. Its rim is
\par plaited in effect, like the edge of a fancy pie, and through numerous
\par openings in this rim is run a heavy ribbon by which to hang it on the
\par wall.
\par 
\par Next in prominence in the window displays of water-front bazaars is the
\par set of bleary-colored glass ware (upper edges bound in gold) which I
\par take to be designed for the purpose of serving punch, or perhaps
\par lemonade--a large bowl of warty surface, with a number of cups to match
\par hanging from hooks at its brim.
\par 
\par The water front obviously is strong for the amenities, the arts and the
\par refinements of life. Bottles of perfume (with huge bows of ribbon at
\par their necks) are in great abundance in its shop windows; as also are
\par packets of boudoir soap (Dawn Lilac seems to be the favorite), toilet
\par powders, silk initial handkerchiefs, opera glasses, ladies' garters of
\par very fluffy design, feminine combs ornamented with birds in gilt,
\par exceedingly high stand-up collars for gentlemen, banjos, guitars,
\par mandolins, accordions (of a great variety of sizes), harmonicas, playing
\par cards, dice and poker chips.
\par 
\par As for the rest of the display, it is a multifarious collection: rubber
\par hip-boots, hair clippers, money belts, brogans, bandana handkerchiefs,
\par binoculars, tobacco pouches, spools of thread, pitch-black plug tobacco,
\par hand searchlights, heavy underwear, woolen sox, razor strops, tin
\par watches, shaving brushes, elaborately carved pipes, trays of heavy
\par rings, and here and there some quaint curiosity, such as a little model
\par of a sailing ship in a bottle which it could not have entered through
\par the mouth, or some such oddity as that.
\par 
\par One old friend of mine on West Street I missed on the Embarcadero. And
\par that is (very battered and worn are the specimens of him which remain as
\par the last of his noble race) the cigar-store wooden Indian.
\par 
\par And (I much regret) neither on the Embarcadero nor on any other water
\par front in America do we have the rich costume ball effects that you find
\par about the docks of London. There (as you remember) about the East India
\par and the West India docks may be observed tall, dark visaged figures in
\par loosely flowing robes and brilliant turbans solemnly pushing along high
\par laden trucks and, high above on the decks of ships, hauling away at
\par ropes.
\par 
\par But on the shore side of the San Francisco water front, my fancy was
\par much taken by the salt sea savor of the signs of the houses of
\par entertainment--signs reminiscent of the jovial days of briny romance,
\par echoed in the chantey in "Treasure Island," which has as its refrain:
\par 
\par     Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.
\par 
\par I passed, among others, the Marine Caf\'e9, the Navy Caf\'e9, the Admiral
\par Caf\'e9, the Harbor Bar, and the Ferry Caf\'e9.
\par 
\par I did not turn up Market Street, but went on around the nose of the
\par peninsula, which is the foundation of San Francisco. I passed a
\par three-masted ship, the _Lizzie Vance_, lying by her wharf, with men
\par aloft in her rigging. Then I clambered up endless relays of rickety
\par wooden stairs mounting Telegraph Hill. On either side of the ladder-like
\par steps, ramshackle cabins bedecked with lines of fluttering "wash." Like
\par the celebrated editor of _Puck_, H. C. Bunner, I might say that in my
\par travels I've missed many a cathedral but I never missed a slum.
\par 
\par I went along through the Latin Quarter, slid down the steep slope of
\par Kearny Street, and found myself wandering into that quaint little park,
\par Portsmouth Square, where R. L. S. in his most stressful days lounged in
\par the sun and listened to the tales of the vagabonds of the Seven Seas.
\par Somewhat bigger than tiny Gramercy Park, hardly as large as little
\par Madison Square, this park. In the center of the bit of rolling lawn,
\par before a towering screen of rustling trees, the graceful little stone
\par ship, buoyant on its curling stone wave, rides atop its tall stone
\par pedestal graved "To Remember Robert Louis Stevenson," and on the face of
\par which is cut that most fragrant of creeds, which (as everyone knows)
\par begins: "To be honest, to be kind, to earn a little and to spend a
\par little less, to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence"
\par ...
\par 
\par Behind the bench on which I rested was the establishment, so proclaimed
\par the legend printed on its front, of Wing Sun, Funeral Director. For, as
\par you know, Portsmouth Square is embraced on one side by prosperous
\par Chinatown, and on the other by the Italian quarter of San Francisco. And
\par the races, Latin and Oriental, mingle in the little park to take the
\par air.
\par 
\par What here is still more colorful and picturesque, frequently there is a
\par striking and amusing mixture of races in the costume of an individual
\par figure. A Manchu lady, it may be, of waxen, enigmatic features, draped
\par in flowing black silken trousers, hobbles along on high-heeled,
\par pearl-colored American shoes. And there a slim reed of an Oriental
\par maiden, with a complexion like a California orange, whisks by in the
\par smartest of tailored suits--without a hat, her gleaming black hair done
\par in Chinese fashion, long ornamented rods thrust through it, a vivid
\par pendant of bright blossoms at one side of the head.
\par 
\par Sitting there, I thought of the nature of public parks and what pleasant
\par places they are.
\par 
\par Splendid thing, elaborate park "systems," whereby you may go for miles
\par through a grimy city, and move among groves and meadows and bosky dells,
\par with inspiriting glimpses of mirror-like ponds and flashing streams all
\par the way. And of course I enjoy the great parks of a great city.
\par 
\par But more appealing to me than the gorgeous spectacle of Hyde Park, or
\par Van Cortlandt, or Fairmont, or Jackson, or Forest Park are the little
\par places tucked here and there in the seething caldron of the town. These
\par are a lovely department of the streets--they are the little parlors of
\par the streets. Here calls are made, and infants sun themselves--they have,
\par these parklets, their social and their domestic life, under the
\par democratic heavens.
\par 
\par Now soon is a time to watch with joy these plots of open space in the
\par city's rushing life. Spring is more winsome on Boston Common and at
\par Union Square than in the country. A tuft of green shoots seen against
\par canyon walls of steel and stone--one must be in the city to savor the
\par tenderness of spring.
\par 
\par And when summer comes and (in our eastern climate) all the town swelters
\par under a blanket of gritty dust and heavy heat, then one comes upon one
\par of these small areas of greenery with the refreshment of spirit with
\par which at the meal hour one greets the appearance of a nice, cool, green
\par salad.
\par 
\par I arose from my seat in Portsmouth Square and wandered off for the rest
\par of the day through the Streets.
\par 
\par

\par CHAPTER XI
\par 
\par BIDDING MR. CHESTERTON GOOD-BYE
\par 
\par 
\par The note, which came altogether as a surprise, read: "My husband
\par suggests that if you have nothing better to do perhaps you would look in
\par upon us on Wednesday evening at about eight-thirty." Mrs. Chesterton
\par further said, in giving the address, that they had a little apartment
\par lent to them for the last week of their stay here. She had asked Mr.
\par Woollcott to come, too, and Gerald Stanley Lee.... "We can only promise
\par you smokes and talk."
\par 
\par I wondered, as I hurried for the 'bus, whether I'd have time to get my
\par shoes polished. It was precisely the hour appointed when I reached what
\par I took to be the door. The hall-man declared that he had "gone out." I
\par insisted that the hall-man telephone up. "No answer," he said, after a
\par bit, and hung up. Now what do you think of that! Well, I'd take a walk
\par and return a little later.
\par 
\par As I was rounding the corner coming back I saw an agile, rotund figure,
\par with a gleam of white shirt-front in the half darkness, mounting the
\par dusky steps instead of descending into the lighted areaway. Looked kinda
\par like Mr. Woollcott. If so, the gentleman was going wrong, so I called to
\par him.
\par 
\par "He has not come back," the hall-man asserted, but assented to our
\par demands to ring up again. No response. "It was about an hour ago he went
\par out," he replied to our question. Standing there, Mr. Woollcott and I
\par contrived several theories. One was that Mr. Chesterton had intended to
\par return by now but had lost track of the time. Another was that possibly
\par Mrs. Chesterton had invited us on her own hook and had overlooked
\par notifying Mr. Chesterton of the matter. "Has a third gentleman been
\par here?" we asked, meaning Mr. Lee. No. We went for a stroll.
\par 
\par It was nine o'clock. And Mr. Woollcott's manner indicated that he was
\par inclined to take some sort of revenge on the hall-man. Was he, the
\par hall-man, certain that he had everything straight? "Sure," he nodded;
\par "it's Mr. Cushman's apartment." Mr. Cushman's apartment! Had we, then,
\par been blundering in the wrong place all this time! "Mr. Chesterton!"
\par roared Mr. Woollcott. Yes, yes; he understood that ... the gentleman had
\par come in yesterday. That was right according to the note I had had from
\par Mrs. Chesterton; so we demanded that the man make another effort at the
\par telephone. Ah!... he heard something. "It's all right," he mumbled;
\par "they are there."
\par 
\par As we got out of the car Mr. Chesterton was cramming the tiny hall. He
\par was in an attitude which I took to be that of a bow, but I later
\par discovered, as he shuffled back and forth about the apartment, that he
\par walks that way all the time now when in the privacy of his own quarters.
\par Mrs. Chesterton greeted us as we entered the room, Mr. Chesterton
\par trailing in behind us and continuing a welcoming murmur which had
\par somewhat the sound of a playful brook. Mrs. Chesterton ensconced herself
\par behind a tea table. Mr. Chesterton lumbered about with cigars. He
\par disclaimed the great easy chair by the electric table lamp in which it
\par was unmistakable that he had been sitting, but was prevailed upon to
\par return to it.
\par 
\par In apology for the lateness of our arrival we mentioned our difficulties
\par in discovering that he was in. Mr. Chesterton seemed bewildered by the
\par circumstance. He shook his head and (evidently referring to the
\par hall-man) said he was not able to understand "that foreigner" at all.
\par "That foreigner?" we smiled at the Englishman. I think it most likely
\par that the explanation of his not having heard our earlier rings was that
\par he was not familiar with the system of bells in the apartment. They had
\par not been out, he declared; oh, yes! they had been out, too, a good while
\par ago, to get something to eat. "We are camping here," he said, "in a
\par rather Bohemian fashion." Didn't they enjoy that as a change from life
\par in fashionable hotels? Oh, yes! Very much.
\par 
\par They wondered if Mr. Lee were not coming. Yes; he had assured me that he
\par was, when I had seen him that afternoon at the club. In fact, we had
\par discussed what we would wear, and had agreed on dinner jackets. Mr.
\par Chesterton was wearing a braid-bound cutaway coat of felt-like material
\par (very much wrinkled in the skirt) and dark striped trousers of stiffish
\par quality, but not recently pressed. His bat-wing collar had a sharp
\par crease extending outward at one side as though it were broken. Though it
\par was a very warm night for early spring--a hot night, indeed--he wore
\par uncommonly heavy woolen sox, which were very much "coming down" about
\par his ankles. His comically small English eye-glasses, with a straight rod
\par joining them across the top, were perpetually coming off his nose. On
\par one finger he wore a rather large ring. I noticed that for so large a
\par man his hands were somewhat small, and were delicately made. At one side
\par of him were three ashtrays (one of them a huge brass bowl well filled
\par with tobacco ash) and at the other side of him one tray.
\par 
\par Well, what sort of a time had he been having? How far west had he got?
\par He had been as far as (I think) Omaha. "Halfway across," he said. He had
\par been much mystified by a curious character he had run into there: a
\par strange being whose waistcoat and coat front were covered by symbolic
\par emblems, crescents, full moons and stars. This person had accosted him
\par in the street saying, "And so you are a lecturer." The man had then
\par informed him that he also was a lecturer. He lectured, he said, on
\par astronomy. "Indeed, in my country," Mr. Chesterton had said, "it is not
\par the custom for astronomers to display on their person devices symbolic
\par of the science in which they are engaged." Next, the man had opened his
\par coat and exhibited the badge of a sheriff, or some sort of officer of
\par the peace. Mr. Chesterton had been astounded to discover the functions
\par of a man of science, a lecturer and a policeman united in one and the
\par same person. It was quite evident that this (as I assume he was)
\par harmless lunatic had made a most decided impression upon Mr.
\par Chesterton's mind; he took the eccentric individual with much
\par seriousness, apparently as some kind of a type; indeed, I feared that we
\par would never get him switched off from talking about him; and I have no
\par doubt that, in the course of time, this ridiculous astronomer will
\par appear as a bizarre character in some fantastic tale, a personage
\par perhaps related to Father Brown, or something like that.
\par 
\par Mr. Chesterton observed that he had enjoyed the opportunity of seeing
\par various grades of American life, that he had been in the homes of very
\par humble people as well as in houses of persons of wealth and social and
\par intellectual position. In a former article I noted how Mr. Chesterton
\par had been greatly startled to find (what he then called) "wooden houses"
\par in this country, and such multitudes of them. He now returned to this
\par phenomenon. What was his one outstanding impression of the United
\par States? Well, he remarked that he had said it before, but he continued
\par to be chiefly struck by the vast number of "frame houses" here.
\par 
\par Mr. Lee arrived. A gentleman who looks very much as though you were
\par looking at his reflection in one of those trick mirrors (such as they
\par have at Coney Island) which humorously attenuate and elongate the
\par figures before them. Or, again, perhaps more justly still, a gentleman
\par who looks as though Daumier had drawn him as an illustration for "Don
\par Quixote." In his evening clothes (to put it still another way), a
\par gentleman who looks much like a very lengthened shadow dancing on a
\par wall. Mr. Whistler would have made something very striking indeed out of
\par Mr. Lee in a dinner coat, something beautifully strange. I do not know
\par that I have ever seen anything finer, in its own exceedingly peculiar
\par way, than Mr. Lee, thus attired, with a cup of tea in his hand.
\par 
\par "Do you like wine?" Mr. Woollcott asked Mr. Chesterton, and told him of
\par a restaurant nearby where this could be obtained. Our prohibition, Mr.
\par Chesterton said, did not bother him so much as might be thought, as for
\par reasons having to do with his health he was (as you or I would say)
\par "off the stuff" at present.
\par 
\par One of us, Mr. Woollcott I think, commented upon the sweep of Mr.
\par Chesterton's fame in the United States. The opinion was advanced that
\par the evening of the day he landed his arrival was known in every literate
\par home in New York. Mr. Chesterton was inclined to think that his
\par "notoriety" in large measure came from his "appearance," his
\par "avoirdupois." Knowledge of him had spread through the notion that he
\par was a "popular curiosity." It was contended that his writing had been
\par well-known over here ten years before his pictures became familiar to
\par us. (Though, of course, I myself do think that the pictorial quality of
\par his corporeal being has been very effective publicity for him.)
\par 
\par Then there was another thing which Mr. Chesterton thought might to a
\par considerable degree account for his American celebrity. That was this
\par "tag" of "paradox." People loved "easy handles" like that, and they went
\par a long way. Somehow or other we let this point pass, or it got lost in
\par the shuffle, and the discussion turned to the question of whether there
\par was an American writer living whose arrival in England would command
\par anything like the general attention occasioned by Mr. Chesterton's
\par entrance into the United States. We could not think of anyone.
\par 
\par Mark Twain, of course; yes. O. Henry, doubtless, too. And, indeed, in
\par the matter of years O. Henry might very well be living now. Mr.
\par Chesterton quite agreed as to the English welcome of Mark Twain or of O.
\par Henry. Tom Sawyer and Huck, he said musingly, certainly were
\par "universal." Then, ponderingly, he observed that English and American
\par literature seemed to be getting farther and farther apart, or more and
\par more distinct each from the other. That is, he remembered that when he
\par was a boy his father and his uncles simply spoke of a new book having
\par come out whether it had been written in England or in the United States.
\par As in the case of the "Autocrat of the Breakfast Table": when it
\par appeared it was enjoyed and talked about by everybody in England; but
\par not spoken of there as a new American book: it was a new book, that's
\par all. Now, however, with Englishmen impressed by the "Spoon River
\par Anthology," "and rightly so," or by "Main Street," "it would not be that
\par way."
\par 
\par He had much liking for O. Henry. But he had begun by not liking him. He
\par had been puzzled by the "queer commercial deals" on which so many of the
\par stories turned--"buying towns, selling rivers." He had, even now, to
\par re-read much of the slang to get the meaning. And so we talked awhile of
\par slang.
\par 
\par "You have an expression here," said Mr. Chesterton, shaking his head as
\par though that were something very remarkable indeed, "_a bad actor_" Much
\par mirth from Woollcott, Lee and Holliday. "Now in England," Mr. Chesterton
\par continued, "we mean by that one who has mistaken his vocation as to the
\par stage. But I discovered that here it has nothing to do with the
\par theatrical profession." Then, it developed, some reporter in the West
\par had referred to him as "a regular guy." At first Mr. Chesterton had been
\par for going after the fellow with a stick.... Certainly a topsy-turvy
\par land, the United States, where you can't tell opprobrium from flattering
\par compliment.
\par 
\par Then one of us told Mr. Chesterton a story of a prize line of American
\par slang. He (the teller of the story) had got a letter in which a friend
\par of his had been spoken of in a highly eulogistic fashion. Thinking this
\par opinion of him would please his friend this man showed the letter to
\par him. The gentleman so much praised in it read the letter and remarked:
\par "Well, whenever I get the hand I always see the red light." Mr.
\par Chesterton looked dazed. "You'll have to translate that to me," he said.
\par It was explained to him that the meaning of this was that whenever this
\par person heard applause of himself he always scented danger. "Oh, oh! I
\par see!" crowed Mr. Chesterton, "the hand, the hand," and he began clapping
\par his hands in illustration of the figure with much glee.
\par 
\par "Glee," yes. And "crowed," also. They are the words, some of the words,
\par to describe Mr. Chesterton's sounds. His utterance was rapid, melodious.
\par The modulations of his softly flowing voice had curiously somewhat the
\par effect of a very cheerful music-box. His easy and very natural command
\par of a great multitude of words was striking. And yet there was something
\par decidedly boyish about the effect of his talk. I think the cause of this
\par was, for one thing, the rather gurgling enjoyment with which he spoke,
\par and for another thing, in his impulsive concern for the point of his
\par idea he frequently did not trouble to begin nor end sentences. He just
\par let 'er go. But the fundamental source of this boyishness of spirit I
\par think was this: I do not believe I have ever seen a man who had borne
\par the brunt of life for some forty-five years and still retained such
\par complete, abounding, unaffected and infectious good humor as Mr.
\par Chesterton.
\par 
\par "As I believe I have said somewhere before," Mr. Chesterton was saying,
\par "it seems to me that the best known character in literature is Sherlock
\par Holmes." Mr. Woollcott was inclined to consider Svengali. Dear me!
\par Svengali may have been in the running at one time, but it strikes me
\par that today he has pretty much gone by the board, somewhat to mix the
\par figure.
\par 
\par As to detective stories: "They are essentially domestic," declares Mr.
\par Chesterton. "Intimate, all in the household, or ought to be. The
\par children's nurse should murder the Bishop. These things where the
\par Foreign Office becomes involved and" (chuckling) "Indian rajahs and
\par military forces come in are never right. They are too big. The detective
\par story is a fireside story."
\par 
\par Had Mr. Chesterton been much to the theatre while here? No; the only
\par thing he had seen was "The Bat." Something like anguish on the face of
\par the dramatic critic of the New York _Times_. Why, he, Mr. Chesterton,
\par had liked "The Bat," a good deal. Speaking of plays, the American
\par presentation of "Magic" came into the conversation. It was remarked that
\par the extremely mystical character of the setting rather crushed the
\par mysticism of the play itself. The idea was advanced that a very simple,
\par matter-of-fact, even bleak setting, would have been the thing to act as
\par an effective foil to this play. Mr. Chesterton seemed to be not the
\par slightest interested in stage-settings. And he knew next to nothing at
\par all about the career of "Magic." He wasn't even sure whether or not he
\par held any proprietary rights in the play. There was, he said as though
\par fumbling around in his mind, something involved about the matter. Friend
\par of his wanted a play. Necessary to finish it in a hurry. He didn't
\par really know, answering a question to this purpose, whether or not he
\par received any royalties from it.
\par 
\par Mrs. Chesterton again handed about some fudge. The collection of
\par ash-trays and bowls surrounding Mr. Chesterton had become jovially
\par freighted with tobacco ash and cigar ends. He smoked his cigars in an
\par economical fashion, down as far as they could comfortably be held.
\par 
\par There was one thing (the talk had turned to his lecturing) Mr.
\par Chesterton "wished you wouldn't do in this country, or that we didn't do
\par in England, either." That was for the gentleman who "introduced" a
\par lecturer to refer to his "message." In his own case, for instance, how
\par ridiculously was this term misapplied. The word "message" conveyed
\par something "quite the opposite of personality." Or, that is, before its
\par popular corruption it had meant something very different. It meant that
\par something was carried. One with a message was a messenger, a vessel, an
\par envelope. It was hard to think of a figure who could rightly be said to
\par have a message. The Old Testament prophets, Mohammed, perhaps. Whitman,
\par now certainly you couldn't say that Whitman had a message.
\par 
\par A ring; and Mr. Cushman came in. Youthfully cropped grey hair. A
\par gentleman who looked like a habitual first-nighter.
\par 
\par Yes, Mr. Chesterton was telling us, it was a curious thing. He had
\par always heard that Americans worshipped machines. A machine everywhere
\par here, and a machine brought to an amazing state of mechanical
\par perfection, was the elevator, as we called it. When he had first got
\par into an American elevator he had been arrested by the fact that the men
\par entering it took off their hats and stood silently with bared heads as
\par it ascended. It is so, he had said to himself, they are at worship, at
\par prayer, this is some religious rite, mystic ceremony, the elevator is
\par their temple.
\par 
\par Had he been in our subway? was asked. No; he had been down in a station
\par one time, but he had not ridden on one of the trains. I wish now that I
\par had thought to cut into the rapid battledore and shuttlecock of the
\par conversation to learn why he had not been. Was he scared of 'em?
\par 
\par What were the things which Mr. Chesterton particularly liked in the
\par United States? Well, for one thing, he very much liked the "elevated."
\par He thought it was grand up in the air that way.
\par 
\par And what had be especially _disliked_? Mr. Lee apparently had knowledge
\par of a memorandum book kept by Mrs. Chesterton, known to their ultimate
\par little circle as her "Book of Likes and Dislikes." She was, with some
\par difficulty, prevailed upon to read from this--which she did very
\par guardedly, clutching the book very firmly before her. Among the things
\par put down in it as not liked were ice cream, ice water, "American boots"
\par (by which was meant women's high-heeled shoes), and interviewers,
\par reporters and camera men. Things especially liked included parlor-car
\par seats. Mr. Chesterton: "I don't dislike it, now. I've got the evil habit
\par of ice water."
\par 
\par "Lift," it was generally agreed, was a happier word than "elevator."
\par Mrs. Chesterton thought that the scientific, technical, correct, or
\par whatever you call them, words for things always took all the feeling of
\par life out of them. "Aviator," for example, had no color at all. But how
\par fine in the spirit of the thing was the popular term "flying-man," or
\par "fly-man"!
\par 
\par The conversation had got momentarily divided into groups. Mr. Chesterton
\par was heard saying to Mr. Woollcott, "The time I mean was when Yeats was
\par young--when mysticism was jazz."
\par 
\par Just how he got started in on them I do not recall. He began with
\par Belloc's most entertaining and highly vivacious ballad which has the
\par refrain, "And Mrs. James will entertain the king"; a kind of a piece
\par among friends, which unfortunately is not in any book. He recited with a
\par kind of joyous unction, nodding his head forward and back from side to
\par side, thus keeping time to the music of the verse, punctuating the close
\par of each stanza with bubble of chuckles. On and on and on and on he went
\par through goodness knows how many bits of rollicking literary fooling.
\par 
\par It was half past eleven. I saw Mr. Chesterton, when someone else was
\par speaking, yawn slightly now and then. The four callers arose to go. Some
\par one of us asked Mr. Chesterton if he expected to be back in America
\par soon. Through a wreath of smiles he replied that he was not getting a
\par return ticket on the boat.
\par 
\par The two of them were framed in their doorway as we got into the
\par "foreigner's" car. Mrs. Chesterton called to us that she hoped to see us
\par all in England, "singly or together." As the car dropped from their
\par floor both were beaming a merry, friendly farewell.
\par 
\par Suddenly it struck me that they were very like a pair of children--they
\par were so happy, so natural, so innocent of guile, and obviously so fond
\par of one another.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XII
\par 
\par NO SYSTEM AT ALL TO THE HUMAN SYSTEM
\par 
\par 
\par I think I'll tell you about myself. Maybe it's the same way with you.
\par Anyhow, it's a mighty queer thing. And we ought to try to get some light
\par on the matter--why there is, apparently, no reason or logic at all about
\par our systems.
\par 
\par You see, I go along a pretty fair amount of the time feeling all right;
\par nothing wrong with my system; nothing, at any rate, that I can notice.
\par Everybody says: "How well you're looking! Great color, you've got." And
\par so on.
\par 
\par Then, maybe, I see in the paper that there is an epidemic scheduled to
\par devastate the city pretty soon. This news lays hold of me right off. The
\par paper goes on to say that it behooves all citizens to take thought to
\par fortify their systems against the ravages of this terrible disease which
\par is rapidly approaching.
\par 
\par Or I read, say, that Thrift Week was such an enormous success (for
\par everybody else) that a campaign is under way to inaugurate a Health
\par Week, which (I read) will greatly reduce the mortality in the community.
\par The way to reduce my own mortality (I read with considerable attention)
\par is for me to Stop, Look and Listen in the matter of my health. And To Do
\par It Now! I don't like those profane words, like mortality. They disturb
\par me. And occasionally get me into no end of trouble--as you'll see.
\par 
\par Or, perhaps, I notice around in cars and places an unusual number of
\par advertisements instructing you what firm to consult in order to
\par "safeguard the interests of your heirs." A died (one of these cards may
\par say) and left his estate to B, his widow, naming C as executor. C died
\par suddenly shortly afterward. B (the widow) met E, with oil lands in
\par Hawaii--and so on. The advertisement winds up: Are you A?
\par 
\par Not yet; I'm not! But I'd better watch out. I know this is a good
\par advertisement because it gets into my mind the way it does.
\par 
\par Or, again, perhaps there are just a number of little things that I come
\par across. A gentleman one day tells me at luncheon, we'll say, that he
\par can't drink tea because it gives him uric acid so bad. Good gracious!
\par And I (maybe) subject to uric acid!
\par 
\par An octogenarian (we'll suppose) is interviewed. He attributes his
\par longevity to abstemiousness in the use of inexpensive cigarettes. (I at
\par once put mine out.)
\par 
\par A chemist (very likely) gets a lot of publicity by declaring that you
\par are to Look Before You Leap in the matter of drinking water. (And but
\par the night before I drank from the spout in the kitchen!) And so on.
\par Well, things such as these set one to thinking.
\par 
\par I say to myself when I get that way (to thinking, I mean) a stitch in
\par time saves nine; there's no loss so bad as the loss of your health,
\par because if you have that you can obtain aught else; a word to the wise
\par is sufficient; make hay while the sun shines; little drops of water wear
\par away the stone; take heed for the morrow while it is yet May; be not
\par like unto the foolish virgin who spilt the beans. And many other things
\par of this kind, which (doubtless in wise measure) are both good and true.
\par 
\par Well, in short, I determine to "build up," to get myself in thoroughly
\par "good shape."
\par 
\par I swear off smoking. I put away the home brew. I do not eat fresh
\par bread. I procure myself overshoes against the rain. I rise with the
\par lark. I (religiously eating an apple first) go to bed betimes. I walk so
\par many miles a day--also skip a rope. I shun all delicacies of the table.
\par I take those horrid extra cold baths, for the circulation. I do "deep
\par breathing." I "relax" for twelve minutes each day. I shun the
\par death-dealing demon "worry." I "fix my mind on cheerful thoughts." I
\par "take up a hobby," philately, or something like that. I eat the skins of
\par potatoes. I watch the thermometer at the office, and monkey continually
\par with the steam radiator. Everything like that.
\par 
\par When you undertake a thing (even if it's only shelling peas) be thorough
\par in it, that's my motto. I don't, indeed, in this regimen get much work
\par done, but it's better to be slow and sure.
\par 
\par Well, what happens?
\par 
\par When I set out to build up this is what happens to me: First thing,
\par maybe, I get pimples. No; no maybe about it. I sure get pimples. Then,
\par very likely, I get a carbuncle. (I have just asked my assistant how you
\par spell that word. She inquires if I mean the gem, or--or the other. I
\par have told her I mean the other.)
\par 
\par Next, very probably, I "contract" (as they say) a cough. This cough
\par "develops" into a cold.... You have (I trust) had that sort of cold
\par which hangs on for months. Nothing recommended is of any help to you.
\par You become resigned (more or less) to the idea--just as a man who has
\par lost a leg (or his mind) must resolve to do the best he can with the
\par rest of his life without his leg (or his mind), so must you adapt
\par yourself to the stern condition imposed by Fate of always having a cold.
\par That's the kind of a cold I mean that I get. (Only worse!)
\par 
\par My cold branches out into several little side lines, such as acute
\par neuralgia and inflammatory rheumatism. Stiff joints impede my agility in
\par getting down the hill to my morning train to the city. I slip on the ice
\par and break my glasses.
\par 
\par Not having my glasses causes me at the office to greet Mr. Sloover as
\par Mr. Rundle, and this sort of error breathes a chill upon the nice
\par nuances of business.
\par 
\par Or in my personal correspondence (if I were that kind of a person) I
\par might put my letter for Penelope into the envelope for Pauline. This,
\par when I had discovered the calamity, would doubtless perturb my thoughts.
\par My thoughts being perturbed, I might walk out of the restaurant without
\par my change of three dollars and eighty cents. Thoroughly upset by now, I
\par walk under a ladder. Realizing that I have done this, my nervousness is
\par the occasion of my dropping my watch. Enough! I recognize that there is
\par no use in my going back to the office that afternoon. I telephone in
\par that I have gone home to bed with my cold.
\par 
\par On coming out of the cigar store where the telephone booth is, I see
\par Christopher Morley, Don Marquis and Franklin P. Adams walking down the
\par street arm in arm. (I can see very little without my glasses, but well
\par enough to recognize such a spectacle as that.) Something, I say, must be
\par on. And I cheer up considerably. Some cheering up certainly is just what
\par I need. I overhaul the company. And I ask it (the company) where it is
\par bound. It says: "For 'Mecca.' Come along." Don hands me a pocket flask
\par (largely empty), Chris presents me with a large green cigar, and Frank
\par gives me a match. It is agreed that we roll a little pool for a few
\par hours while waiting for the cab.
\par 
\par Well, you see, I've been led to abandon the idea of building up my
\par health--but I don't care, one may as well die happy.
\par 
\par I have a great time at that show. (My cold is immensely better.) I fix
\par on one eye-glass so as to see something desirable. And I cut up a lot.
\par 
\par But--when we turn to leave I discover the president of my company going
\par out just ahead of me. Well, I suppose I'll have to take what is coming
\par to me tomorrow.
\par 
\par That one good meal, anyhow (after the pool), has strengthened my spirit
\par immensely. I plan to have a regular, genuine breakfast in the morning.
\par The kind I used to enjoy before I started in to get myself in fine
\par shape. A breakfast of sliced pineapple, eggs, steak, fried potatoes,
\par cottage-cheese, hot rolls, and two pots of good strong coffee. A pipe
\par afterward.
\par 
\par When I get out to the house I find that my uncle (from whom I had been
\par estranged for years) has died, and left me his fine, ninety carat, forty
\par jewel, repeater watch.
\par 
\par I wake up bursting with joyous life. The girl tells me that those
\par especially handsome glasses I lost last New Year's Eve have been found.
\par Down at the station the station-master comes out to greet me. He says
\par so many people have slipped on our hill that next week the railroad is
\par going to install a free coach service. I see by the morning paper that
\par the horse I took a twelve to one shot on in the Buenos Aires derby came
\par out the length of the stretch to the good. On the train into town I
\par smoke a couple of packages of cigarettes--as I become a bit bothered
\par about the situation at the office.
\par 
\par A girder, or something, had fallen across the track. The train is held
\par up. For a couple of hours it stands there. I become more than decidedly
\par nervous. Now this is awful bad doings. Everything had been coming so
\par right again. It seems as if there is no reward in this world for
\par anything. Here for a whole month or so I had been subjecting myself to
\par the most rigorous and unpleasant kind of discipline solely in order to
\par make myself more efficient in my work, and so more valuable to the
\par house. Nothing else. Then by an accident I am kept away from the office
\par one afternoon, and this has to go and happen just to keep me away
\par probably the whole of the forenoon. Everything will, of course, be
\par misunderstood and misinterpreted. Instead of getting just credit for
\par what I've done, I'll probably get bounced. If anyone wants to have the
\par moral of this story pointed out to him: it is that there is not much use
\par in trying, you can see that.
\par 
\par When I do get to the office my secretary is in quite a flurry. She tells
\par me that Mr. Equity, the president, has been inquiring for me. In
\par fact--she hesitates--wants me to step in to see him as soon as I arrive.
\par 
\par So, there you are!
\par 
\par Mr. Equity (a most unusual thing in any circumstances) shakes my hand
\par with great cordiality. He smiles, not benignantly but rather
\par deferentially. Says that he has recognized for some little time that I
\par have not had a salary commensurate with my services. Times, however, are
\par not of the best. Would I be willing to continue with the firm at--a
\par pause--well, double my present salary? Everything, he adds, would be
\par made as pleasant for me as possible.
\par 
\par His secretary whispers to me in an outer office: "He has been so
\par flustered. He was scared you weren't ever coming back."
\par 
\par I discussed this matter of the strange workings of the human system with
\par a friend of mine outside the office. "Ah!" he said, "you didn't
\par persevere long enough in looking after yourself. If you had kept it up
\par for a year instead of only a month, you'd be a well man today. And," he
\par added seriously, "a successful man, too."
\par

\par CHAPTER XIII
\par 
\par SEEING THE "SITUATIONS WANTED" SCENE
\par 
\par 
\par "What a lot of things they put in the papers!" Hilaire Belloc observes
\par somewhere in one of his essays. Indeed, it is so!
\par 
\par I fear, however, that one of the features "they" put in the papers does
\par not have anything like as popular a reading as it deserves to have.
\par Those of the governing class, personages who employ people, probably
\par consult fragments of this department of the newspaper now and then. But,
\par it may fairly be claimed, nobody reads, with the delicious pleasure and
\par the abundant profit he might read, that part of the paper fullest of all
\par of, so to say, meat and gravy.
\par 
\par The story it tells is probably the deepest grounding in life to be found
\par in print. There as it stands in today's paper Shakespeare (I fancy)
\par could not have written it, nor Balzac, nor Dickens, nor Arnold Bennett,
\par nor O. Henry, nor Sinclair Lewis. This newspaper feature is called
\par "Situations Wanted." It might just as accurately be called "The Human
\par Scene," or "The Heart of the World," or "The Cry of the Soul." Its tale
\par is of what all men are seeking (and have ever sought), each in his own
\par degree, and after his fashion--bread, a place in the sun, a level higher
\par than that of today.
\par 
\par Let us, briefly, survey this Page of Life.
\par 
\par The most conspicuous figure in the vast and motley throng is the Bold
\par and Confident Man. He that knows his superior worth and does not propose
\par to hide his light, he that has the spirit to attack the conqueror. His
\par method is to fling a large and arresting headline across his "ad." "I AM
\par THE MAN YOU WANT!" he begins. Or, "PAR-EXCELLENCE," he announces in big
\par type. Or, "Mr. Busy Manufacturer," he says in good sized "caps"; in
\par smaller letters asks: "Are you in need of _a competent manager_?" If Mr.
\par B. M. is in such need, it is squarely put up to him: he "will do well to
\par address X." To the employer who hesitates this vital opportunity is
\par lost. The ad says: "Write now--_Right Now!_" Undoubtedly this is the
\par horse to put your money on; the hero to marry your daughter to. He will
\par not want.
\par 
\par Our bold, aggressive friend frequently writes, barring a bit of
\par "bounce," an admirable, clean-cut account of himself. He has, he
\par declares, acted for some of the leading concerns in the country; he has
\par never yet failed to give satisfaction; every employer he ever had will
\par testify to his ability and character. He invites the closest
\par investigation of his record, and he is open for any engagement where
\par faithful work, absolute integrity and devotion to his employer's
\par interests will be productive of "a fair living salary." It is, indeed,
\par difficult to avoid the impression that this man "has the goods."
\par 
\par Akin to him in his method of a bill-board-like headline is another, of
\par whom one is not so sure. He does not so much command attention as seek
\par to beguile it. His particular "lay" is the Ingenious. Here is one
\par example of his style:
\par 
\par                     AN ADVERTISING ADVENTURER
\par 
\par                    offers 16 years' experience
\par 
\par      (scarred by a few notable defeats and a thorough knowledge edge of
\par      what NOT to do) to a manufacturer, for whom he will SAVE more than
\par      his wages; a bad man, who does not drink, never was out of work, is
\par      married and proud of it; age 32; would rather work than eat.
\par      Address: Alert.
\par 
\par Then there is the Challenge Not to Be Denied. Here is a sample:
\par "_Accountant_.--Are you one of the progressive firms? If you are, you
\par want----" etc. Frequently one comes across the Facetious Advertiser. He
\par runs some such headline as this: "_Editor for Rent._" Or perhaps he
\par says: "'_Secretarial Services' For Sale._" In contrast to him is the
\par advertiser with the Tremulous Appeal. He may begin: "_Who Wants My
\par Services?_" And go on to say: "I am hard worker and steady, and willing
\par to go anywhere. Salary about $12 a week." Or perhaps he says:
\par "_Privilege_ of meeting man who can utilize my services." Or maybe it is
\par thus: "$15 per Week and an Opportunity." Such a very human ad as this is
\par likely to continue somewhat like this:
\par 
\par      Can you use a young man of twenty-one--one of really serious
\par      purpose? I have had enough business experience and training to know
\par      that to be of help I must do well whatever I am given to do. Of
\par      course I am looking for a future--but I know that it does not
\par      matter so much what I do as how I do it. Therefore, I believe any
\par      reputable business holds a future. I am from Kansas, in New York on
\par      my own resources and so must have $15 per week to start. I have a
\par      high school education, and have read a great deal, and have
\par      attended Business School.
\par 
\par Next is the Poignant ad. The purest example of this which in my studies
\par I have discovered is headed: "_Who Will Talk With Me?_" A step beyond
\par this we come upon the Altogether Pitiful. I mean like the one I here
\par copy out:
\par 
\par      WILL you please find or give office employment to an educated, with
\par      physical defect, young man; just a chance to work two weeks without
\par      salary desired?
\par 
\par Akin to the poignant situation-wanted advertisement is the Urgent:
\par "_Advertising Writer_, college man (Princeton), urgently needs
\par situation." Or: "_Proofreader_, educated young man, requires position
\par _immediately_." It is, such is the inference, defective philanthropy in
\par an employer to delay. A touching figure, too (because he does not
\par suspect that he is a touching figure), is the Cheery and Hopeful. We
\par have him here: "_Ambitious_ young American (28) desires position; will
\par try anything; moderate salary to start."
\par 
\par A wily fellow is the Ingratiating advertiser. Sometimes he is a "Spanish
\par young man" who offers to work altogether without salary as Spanish
\par correspondent in some export house "where he could practice English."
\par Occasionally he is a "copy writer" who, wishing a position with an
\par agency or mercantile firm, is "willing to demonstrate ability for two
\par weeks before drawing salary." Now and then a still more positive
\par character baits the hook with the offer of gratis services. In this
\par morning's paper a stenographer releases the seductive declaration that
\par "one trial will demonstrate my value to you."
\par 
\par A r\'f4le played on the stage of the "Situations Wanted" page which I have
\par always much admired is that of the Highly Dignified. The Bold and
\par Confident Man, the Ingenious, the Tremulous, the Poignant, the Hopeful,
\par the Ingratiating--the voices of all these figures touch one with a sense
\par of the harsh clash of life, its trickiness, its vicissitudes, its pathos
\par and its tragedy. But "_A Gentleman_ of 50," who, "having a considerable
\par private income, desires dignified occupation; salary unimportant,"
\par revives the poetic idea that (at any rate, now and then) God's in His
\par heaven and all's right with the world. The highly dignified advertiser
\par certainly is a very enviable character. It must be very nice to be able
\par to say, as in this advertisement before us: "_Light Occupation of an
\par Important Nature_ is sought by middle-aged gentleman capable of assuming
\par control and conducting any normal business enterprise."
\par 
\par A very colorful feature of the "Situations Wanted" page is the
\par interesting qualifications frequently set forth. Glancing at the paper
\par in hand I find a young man of twenty-five who seeks a "permanent
\par position" with a publisher recommending himself as being "affable." Also
\par here is a "refined gentleman" who desires a "compatible" position and
\par lists among his accomplishments skill in the art of "tasty drawing." A
\par "keen discreet American" looking for a job with a "corporation" mentions
\par his "suave manners." A butler unemployed regards himself as "very nice."
\par A college graduate of twenty-eight who wants to "begin at the bottom"
\par asserts that he is a "fluent talker." A "young man with literary
\par ability" flings out the intimation that he "desires position where it
\par will be of some use." A dressmaker states that in her calling she is
\par "perfect." A clerk is "very smart at figures." A nurse puts forward her
\par asset as a "plain writer." You are pleased to discover that so many
\par people have a "pleasing personality." And that among stenographers there
\par are so many who may be described (they say) as an "attractive young
\par girl." Here is one who introduces herself as both "prepossessing" and
\par "brainy." A "woman of education" who seeks occupation at "anything
\par useful if there is friendliness" gives as her leading characteristic a
\par "sense of humor." Now and then the recommendations offered somewhat
\par mystify me, as in the advertisement of the lady, "age 29, fine
\par personality (widow of P. M. of F. and A. M.)." Then there is that great
\par company who have but one merit to display. They may be represented in
\par the "Female" column by the "_Respectable_ young woman" who "wishes day's
\par work." And in the "Male" column by the "_Sober_ man" who (simply)
\par "desires position." Sometimes here it is difficult to determine the
\par degree of sobriety maintained, as in the frequent advertisement of the
\par chauffeur who discreetly states that he is "temperate."
\par 
\par In case you should write down your idea of your own "appearance," what
\par would you say? I confess that such a problem would puzzle me. It does
\par not puzzle some. "Situation Wanted" ads record that there are numerous
\par young men of "exceptional appearance." Though occasionally we come upon
\par a young man of almost painful conscientiousness who feels that he should
\par not go further than to say that he is of "fair appearance."
\par 
\par The queer dissimilarity of human aspirations echoes through the
\par "Situations Wanted" page. Here is a "_Gentleman_, excellent education
\par and personality, linguist," who wants a position as a companion, or
\par "courier, &c." A "_Highly_ educated French lady would gladly take a
\par child for walks every day from 10 to 12." A "_Lady_, 27, of literary
\par bent desires position as companion around the world." It is remarkable,
\par the number of persons there are in the world of "literary" tendency.
\par Remarkable, too, how many people with an inclination to travel. Here is
\par a "_Cornell Graduate_" who has, apparently, no aversion whatever to
\par spending the winter in "a warm climate." There are "_Two_ young men,
\par partners," who "wish to join an expedition, any destination." But there
\par are home-keeping souls, too. A "_Cultured_ elderly man, neat," craves
\par "household duties." And so on.
\par 
\par What a rich variety of characters throng the populous scene of the
\par "Situations Wanted" page! Here, in today's paper, following the
\par advertisement of a "sculptor" comes that of a "former policeman." A
\par "_Physician_, practicing twenty years in Paris, speaking English,
\par French, Spanish, German, Italian, seeking situation," is cheek by jowl
\par with a "_Plumber_, good all round man." A young man who has "put 9 years
\par at sea as steward" nonchalantly asks "What have you?" A "_Former
\par College Professor_, 30, seeks field of occupation in advertising." And a
\par "_Cavalry_ man, excellent record, wishes position at anything." A
\par "_Cultured Visiting Governess_ of good family, social position, trains
\par ladies, English, grammar, literature, elegant correspondence, art of
\par conversation, current events, social etiquette." A remarkable
\par "gentleman" presents himself as "qualified to do most anything." And a
\par "Christian, age 38," wishes a position as "manager of a laundry."
\par 
\par A strategic device frequently employed by the humble is that of getting
\par someone whose position has weight to present them. For instance, "Rev.
\par Dr. Moffett recommends a colored man for janitor of a loft building."
\par And numerous are the gentlemen who, laying up their cars, are interested
\par in placing their chauffeurs elsewhere.
\par 
\par "_Boy_" is perhaps the word which dominates the page. Most boys,
\par apparently, are not particular in their choice of a calling. They are
\par "willing to do anything." Now and then one declares that he is a "good
\par fighter," or something like that. Here is one who demands a "position
\par where mental ability will be necessary." Here is another who is very
\par specific, thus: "15-1/2 years old, 5 feet 8-1/4 inches tall."
\par 
\par Sometimes one meets a very extraordinary character in these columns. The
\par other day no less a distinguished person than this put in an ad:
\par 
\par      I am compelled, through severe strain, to discontinue my work
\par      (involving the mental faculties) with which I have puzzled the
\par      scientific world for several years, and which has netted me a
\par      weekly income of over $200; I have no other source for a livelihood
\par      and consequently appeal to the business world for an opportunity to
\par      grow up in a new endeavor. WHY NOT MEET ME AND TALK IT OVER?
\par 
\par A genuinely touching ad, sensible and obviously quite sincere, in which
\par you hear the appealing voice of a fellow being in trouble, but an ad
\par which I fear is rather futile, is one like this:
\par 
\par      Am 43 years old; defective hearing prevents continuation of
\par      salesman's career; I want situation where this impairment does not
\par      prevent satisfactory discharge of required duties.
\par 
\par A great, and a grave, lesson may be learned from the "Situations Wanted"
\par page. And that is to be found mainly in the section where the first word
\par of each advertisement is simply "MAN." Men there are in it of every age.
\par I mean in considering the plight of the world one should ponder that
\par great army whose business is "anything."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XIV
\par 
\par LITERARY LIVES
\par 
\par 
\par "My God!" exclaimed the old lady in the railway carriage to Mr. Le
\par Gallienne, "Tennyson is dead!"
\par 
\par Have not many of us as we have turned the daily papers these last
\par several years frequently experienced the sensations of this dear old
\par lady? Whistler, Swinburne, Meredith, Henry James, Howells. They are
\par dead. Walt Whitman (wasn't it?), when he heard that Carlyle was dead,
\par went out, and looked up at the stars, and said he didn't believe it.
\par 
\par We have been stirred to these emotional reflections by chancing to come
\par early this afternoon in the Main Reading Room of the New York Public
\par Library upon what would commonly be called a well-known book of
\par reference. We had no intention of doing more than peer into it. Night
\par found us there--the book still open before us.
\par 
\par The excellent Solomon Eagle (otherwise known as J. C. Squire), in one of
\par his delightfully gossipy, though erudite, papers contributed to _The New
\par Statesman_ of London (collected, many of them, into a volume, bearing
\par the title "Books in General"), remarks of works of reference that they
\par "are extremely useful; but they resemble Virgil's Hell in that they are
\par easy things to get into and very difficult to escape from." He
\par continues:
\par 
\par      Take the Encyclop\'e6dia. I imagine that my experience with it is
\par      universal. I have only to dip my toe into this tempting morass and
\par      down I am sucked, limbs, trunk and all, to remain embedded until
\par      sleep or a visitor comes to haul me out. A man will read things in
\par      the Encyclop\'e6dia that he would never dream of looking at
\par      elsewhere--things in which normally he does not take the faintest
\par      interest....
\par 
\par      "Who's Who" takes me in the same way. Ordinarily I have no
\par      particular thirst for it. I should not dream of carrying it about
\par      in my waistcoat pocket for perusal on the Underground Railway. But
\par      once I have allowed myself to open it, I am a slave to it for
\par      hours. This has just happened to me with the new volume, upon which
\par      I have wasted a valuable afternoon. I began by looking up a man's
\par      address; I then read the compressed life-story of the gentleman
\par      next above him (a major-general), wondering, somewhat idly, whether
\par      they read of each other's performances and whether either of them
\par      resented the possession by the other of a similar, and unusual,
\par      surname. Then I was in the thick of it.
\par 
\par Even so. But an afternoon spent in reading, straight along, the work of
\par reference we have in mind could not be called wasted. Indeed, quite the
\par contrary; such an afternoon could be nothing less than one of those
\par spiritual experiences which suddenly give a measure of growth to the
\par soul.
\par 
\par The work which we came upon, in the circumstances indicated, was "The
\par Dictionary of National Biography"; and the volumes which, by chance, we
\par took down were Volumes II. and III. of the Second Supplement of the
\par Dictionary. They contain, these volumes, memoirs of 1,135 noteworthy
\par English persons dying between January 22, 1901, and December 31, 1911.
\par The alphabet extends from John Faed, artist, to George, Lord Young,
\par Scottish Judge. The contributors number 357; the list of these names is
\par a roll of the most distinguished, in all departments, in the English
\par Nation of our day. This publication, we should say, is the most
\par interesting to English-speaking people, as in all probability it is the
\par most important, generally, issued within at any rate the year of its
\par publication. And though we cannot rid ourselves of a melancholy feeling
\par in contemplating this survey of the great stream of brilliant life
\par ended, we feel there is more good reading for the money in these pages
\par than in any other book one is likely to come across at random.
\par 
\par The toll these ten years have taken! The chronicle is here of some born
\par to greatness, like Queen Victoria; of those, like Cecil Rhodes, who have
\par achieved it. And the stories are told of some whom the world's fame
\par found but within the last hour, then dead: John Millington Synge
\par (contributed by John Masefield), and Francis Thompson (by Everard
\par Meynell).
\par 
\par The proportion of biographies of men of letters predominates in
\par considerable measure. Science follows in the list, then art. The least
\par but one, sport, is the law. Among the names of women, forty-six in
\par number, are Florence Nightingale, Kate Greenaway, Charlotte Mary Yonge,
\par and Mrs. Craigie (John Oliver Hobbes).
\par 
\par Three illustrious lives entered the twentieth century in England as full
\par of years as of honors. Meredith, Whistler, and Swinburne were born in
\par the Spring of the nineteenth century, in 1828, 1834, and 1837
\par respectively, and the bloom of their days was with the giants, now
\par legends, of the Victorian reign. The Kings in the history of art and
\par letters have been--have they not?--gallant men. We suspect that it takes
\par a gallant man to be a King in these callings. Of these three--two
\par wished to be soldiers--the most gallant spirit was the great-grandson of
\par a rather grand tailor.
\par 
\par He won what men can and he bore what men must, is some ancient line.
\par 
\par The most extensive article in these volumes is the "Meredith," by Thomas
\par Seccombe. It is the richest. Twelve pages is its compass. As a biography
\par we are disposed to rank it with--let's see?---Froude's "Carlyle" (4
\par vols. 8vo.). Perhaps, on the whole, it is better. To go into any detail
\par in our notice of the appearance of these books, and maintain any
\par perspective, would carry us to a vast length. The bibliographer is
\par deeply impressed with the character of Meredith, as a man, throughout
\par his life, of noble aspect. His critical verdict reduced to one word is:
\par "Thoroughly tonic in quality, his writings are [as Lamb said of
\par Shakespeare] essentially manly." This is one of the pictures which most
\par brightly sticks in our head:
\par 
\par      On the terrace in front of the chalet, whence he descended to
\par      meals, he was often to be heard carrying on dialogues with his
\par      characters, and singing with unrestrained voice. Whimsical and
\par      sometimes Rabelaisian fabrications accompanied the process of
\par      quickening the blood by a spin [a favorite word with him] over
\par      Surrey hills. Then he wrote his master works, ... and welcomed his
\par      friends, often reading aloud to them in magnificent recitative,
\par      unpublished prose or verse.
\par 
\par If there is anything upon which an article could be "based" not included
\par in Mr. Seccombe's list of sources, it's a queer thing.
\par 
\par The "Swinburne" is furnished by Edmund Gosse, whose adequate equipment
\par for the task includes "personal recollections extending over more than
\par forty years." Passages of his portrait of the radiant poet are the most
\par colorful in these volumes of the Dictionary. By way of critical
\par discussion the writer says: "It is a very remarkable circumstance, which
\par must be omitted in no outline of his intellectual life, that his
\par opinions, on politics, on literature, on art, on life itself, were
\par formed in boyhood, and that though he expanded he scarcely advanced in
\par any single direction after he was twenty. If growth had continued as it
\par began, he must have been the prodigy of the world. Even his art was at
\par its height when he was five and twenty." The Whistler article is by Sir
\par Walter Armstrong (who writes also on Holman Hunt) and is, one feels, the
\par most judicial summary that has appeared on the most controversial
\par subject, one can readily recall, of the epoch closed. A very clear
\par statement of a principle of the art of painting is this: "For years his
\par work bore much the same relation to Japanese art as all fine painting
\par does to nature. He took from Japanese ideals the beauties he admired,
\par and re-created them as expressions of his own personality."
\par 
\par There is one delightful anecdote, in E. V. Lucas's sketch of Phil May.
\par His Punch editor, Sir Francis Burnand, tells a story to the effect that
\par on being asked at a club for a loan of fifty pounds, May produced all he
\par had--half that amount--and then abstained from the club for some time
\par for fear of meeting the borrower, because he felt that "he still owed
\par him twenty-five pounds."
\par 
\par Sensible persons will read with satisfaction the just article by T. F.
\par Henderson on that fine figure Henley, "one of the main supports," said
\par Meredith, "of good literature in our time." Many good folks will like to
\par look up Leslie Stephen, the first editor of this Dictionary, "who
\par enjoyed the affectionate admiration of his most enlightened
\par contemporaries." The article is by the present editor, Sir Sidney Lee.
\par \'c6sthetically minded persons may read about William Sharpe. Among the
\par painters are Watts (biographer, Sir Sidney Colvin) and Orchardson. The
\par "Seymour Haden" is furnished by A. M. Hind. Memoirs of Sir Henry Irving,
\par Sir Theodore Martin, and Herbert Spencer come in this supplement. And so
\par on. A piece of American history is related here, too, in the account of
\par Edward Lawrence Godkin, founder of _The Nation_.
\par 
\par A subject of emotional literary controversy at the present moment is
\par treated by Thomas Seccombe in his article on George Gissing. The general
\par qualities of the Dictionary may be clearly observed in this notice. When
\par the first volume of this second supplement--A to Evans--was issued not
\par long ago rumors reached us of some agitation occasioned in England by
\par the unepitaphical character of the memoirs of Edward VII. Well,
\par discrimination was not made against a King. The frankness of this high
\par tribunal in its calm recital of facts is striking.
\par 
\par After some steady reading of the great Dictionary we wonder if printed
\par forms had been sent to the contributors, upon which they composed, in
\par answer to the questions there, their articles: the order of progress of
\par all the memoirs is, in effect, so uniform. Each says at (it appeared)
\par about the same point: His appearance was this. Each seems to conclude
\par with a list of the portraits.
\par 
\par And this idea recalled to us a story. A foreigner entering our country's
\par gates, upon being asked to fill out papers setting forth his
\par nationality, age, color, and so on, wrote beside the query,
\par "Business?"--"Rotten." In this intelligent interpretation of the
\par question, the "business" of many whose lives are recorded in honor here
\par was "rotten" for many a long year.
\par 
\par The story of literature has not ceased to be a sorry story; still, as
\par was said on a time, comparable to the annals of Newgate. A tale it
\par continues, in a large measure, of outcast experience, of destitution,
\par "seeking a few pence by selling matches or newspapers," or development
\par through suffering, of hospital sojourns, of contemplated suicide, of
\par unfortunate "amorous propensities," of "ill-considered" marriage, of
\par that immemorial "besetting weakness," of "a curious inability to do the
\par sane, secure thing in the ordinary affairs of life," of "ordering his
\par life with extreme carelessness in financial matters," of the weariness
\par of reward for work of high character long deferred, of charitable
\par legacies "from a great-aunt."
\par 
\par Mr. Wells speaks somewhere of the amazing persistency of the instinct
\par for self-expression. Where it exists, one reflects in musing on these
\par biographies, you can't kill it with a club.
\par 
\par Very imposing we felt the literary style of this Dictionary to be. It
\par treats of a man much as if he were a word, say, in the Century
\par Dictionary. This is the sort of biographical writing, we said, that a
\par man with whiskers can read. It does sound something like a court
\par calendar. Its tone is omniscient, indeed. But the Recording Angel here
\par does not drop a tear upon the oath of any Uncle Toby and blot it out
\par forever. No. He says, of one we tremble to name, "his language was often
\par beyond the reach of apology." Fine is the dignity with which sordid
\par things are related. "The return journey he was under the necessity of
\par performing on foot." Almost grotesque is the neglect of the caressing
\par touch of sentiment. "His own wish was to be a jockey." The treatment of
\par the theme of love is entertaining. "At the age of nineteen he married."
\par 
\par August is the passivity in the presence of the Reaper who mows the
\par golden grain. Without poetry, oh, Death, where is thy sting! In these
\par volumes, of none is it sighed: At twilight his spirit fled. Had he but
\par lived ...! It is: He died December 14, 1908. He left no issue. A fair
\par portrait of him by Charles Ricketts is in the possession of Mr. Edmund
\par Gosse.
\par 
\par We arose after several hours' reading with a sense of having perused for
\par a space two recent volumes of the Book of Judgment. We were full of
\par emotion. We felt the mystery of the destiny of man. How admirable he is
\par and how pitiful! Throbbing, we went forth into the throbbing city.

\par 
\par CHAPTER XV
\par 
\par SO VERY THEATRICAL
\par 
\par 
\par There is a young woman I thought of taking there for luncheon the other
\par day, but when I called for her it did not seem to me that she had used
\par her lip-stick that morning--and so we went somewhere else.
\par 
\par She is pretty good-looking and was dressed not at all unfashionably. She
\par would have done all right at the Waldorf, or at the Vanderbilt, or
\par Biltmore, or Ritz-Carlton, or Ambassador. Indeed, I don't know but that
\par at some such place as that I should have been rather proud of her.
\par 
\par But, you see, for the place I had in mind her skirt was a little too
\par long--it came almost halfway to her ankles. Her bosom was quite covered.
\par She moves with fair grace, but without striking sinuousness. And I
\par suddenly recollected that she does not smoke much.
\par 
\par No; I saved myself just in time; I should have been chagrined,
\par embarrassed, most decidedly uncomfortable; she would have been
\par conspicuous. I should probably have lost caste with the waiters, too;
\par and not again have been able to get a table after the plush rope had
\par been thrown across the entrance to the dining-room; which, so keen is
\par competition for places there, is shortly before one o'clock.
\par 
\par If you know where this place is, why, of course, all right. But nobody
\par has any business to go shouting all over the housetops exactly where it
\par is. People who aren't just naturally by temperament a part of the
\par picture oughtn't to know how to find it. Though it is a perfectly good
\par bet that bunches of them would like to know.
\par 
\par But that's just the way so many of these havens of the elect get ruined.
\par A lot of curious "visitors" go piling in right along; the scene soon
\par loses all its authenticity; and shortly becomes bogus altogether. Why, I
\par can remember when artists--painters and writers--lived in Greenwich
\par Village. There, in those days.... But all that was years ago.
\par 
\par This much only will I tell you about the location of the most
\par _distingu\'e9_ place there is in which to have luncheon. The centre of the
\par inhabited world is, of course, Longacre Square, that widened curving
\par stretch of Broadway looking north several blocks from the narrow stern
\par of the gracefully towering Times Building, rising from its site of a bit
\par of an island surrounded by four surging currents of traffic. A few miles
\par away (from Longacre Square) the provinces begin. But there, the most
\par gleaming spot on this our globe under the canopy of the purple night, is
\par the quintessence, the apex of human life.... I am here speaking, of
\par course, in the spirit of those of that nomad race whose hopes for gold
\par and fame lie through the "stage entrance"--I mean the ladies and
\par gentlemen of the theatre.
\par 
\par To the east just off Longacre Square along the crosstown streets is a
\par medley of offices of divers theatrical and screen journals, chop-houses,
\par and innumerable band-box hotels whose names doubtless only a district
\par messenger boy could recite in any number. The particular one for which
\par we are headed is famous enough to those familiar with fame of this
\par character. Here the "Uncle Jack" of the American stage, Mr. Drew, for
\par some time made his residence. It is always the stopping place in New
\par York of perhaps the finest of our novelists, Joseph Hergesheimer. That
\par mystical Indian gentleman, Mr. Rabindranath Tagore, has found it a not
\par unworthy tent on his western pilgrimages. And so on.
\par 
\par You cannot be long in its rich little lobby without overhearing struck
\par the high note of its distinctive clientele. "Where do you open?" asks
\par someone of someone else. And the answer is not unlikely to be: "At
\par Stamford. When do you close?" In the subdued light bare satin arms and
\par enspiriting lengths of colorful stocking flash from the deep chairs
\par where feminine forms are waiting. A graceful hand opens a telephone
\par booth to expel a smoking cigarette.
\par 
\par Here enters Walter Prichard Eaton, come down from his Berkshire farm for
\par the height of the theatrical season. A tall, leisurely, very New
\par Englandish, smooth-shaven young man, now coming decidedly grey just over
\par the ears. Entering the dining-room we come plump against our old friend
\par Meredith Nicholson lunching with a bevy of friends. A youthful fifty
\par perhaps now, the author of one of the best sellers of any day, "The
\par House of a Thousand Candles." Clean-shaven, with a physiognomy
\par suggesting that of a Roman senator. What has brought him just now from
\par Indiana? Well, he is revolving in his mind the idea of writing a new
\par play, as soon, he adds, as he "can find the right ink." Hasn't been
\par able to get hold of any that just suited him.
\par 
\par But much more important to his mind, apparently, than this play is
\par another mission in which he has become involved. He is going to have
\par himself "mapped," that is, have his horoscope cast. Yes, by one of the
\par ladies of his party, who, it appears, is eminent as a professor of this
\par science, now rapidly coming into a period of great vogue. When he has
\par supplied her with the data concerning his birth she will reveal to him
\par the course of his career through 1922.
\par 
\par On a number of the tables are cards marked "Reserved." Around two sides
\par of the room upholstered seats running the length of the wall seat
\par couples in greater intimacy of t\'eate-\'e0-t\'eate side by side before their
\par little tables. Most of the young women present--but could you really
\par call many of them young women?... Their most striking feature, after the
\par dizziness of their beauty, and the ravishing audacity of their clothes,
\par is the bewitching tenderness of their years. More than several of these
\par dainty, artfully rose-cheeked smokers look to be hardly past seventeen.
\par Their foppishly dressed male companions frequently are in effect far
\par from anything like such youth; and in a number of cases are much more
\par likely to remind you of Bacchus than of Apollo.
\par 
\par Two of these misses nearby are discussing with one another their
\par "doorman." "Isn't he," exclaims one, "the very dearest old doorman you
\par have ever seen in all of your whole life!" Yes, it would seem that,
\par peering down the long vista of the past, from out of their experience of
\par hundreds of theatres, neither of these buds of womanhood could recall
\par any doorman so "dear" as their present one.
\par 
\par The dominant group in the room is a gay and populous party about a large
\par round table in the centre. And undoubtedly the dominant figure of this
\par party is, you recognize, Alexander Woollcott, dramatic critic of the New
\par York _Times_, invariably at this same table at this same hour, a very
\par spirited, a very round plump young man, very dapper to the end of every
\par hair in his trim little black moustache. Next to him who is that? Why,
\par goodness me! if it isn't Edna Ferber, who, though I doubt not she would
\par not want to be counted in the fledgling class of some of our soubrette
\par friends here, indeed does seem to be getting younger all the while.
\par 
\par Joining this party now is an odd and rather humorous looking figure,
\par tall, amusingly stooping and amusingly ample of girth for a character of
\par such apparently early manhood, an intensely black crop of hair and a
\par very blackish streak of moustache, soft collar, unpressed clothes. Sits
\par down, hooping himself over his plate with a suggestion of considerable
\par shyness. Gives you an impression, perhaps by the brightness of his eyes,
\par of Puckish mirth playing within his mind. Heywood Broun.
\par 
\par At the table on our right we perceive a very popular lady known to us,
\par Miss Margaret Widdemer, or, as she now is, Mrs. Robert Haven Schauffler.
\par Her general air breathing the simplicity of a milkmaid amid this scene.
\par Under her mammoth floppy hat reminding you of an early summer rose. She
\par is discussing with a spectacled person who looks as if he might have
\par something to do with book publishing whether her next book should be a
\par light romance on the order of her "Wishing-Ring Man" and "Rose Garden
\par Husband" or she should come into the new movement of serious "Main
\par Street" kind of realism.
\par 
\par And there, on our left, certainly is a publisher, Mr. Liveright of the
\par firm of Boni and Liveright. Young fellow, thirty-five perhaps. Maybe he
\par is talking about some of his striking successes, such as "Potterism" and
\par "From Mayfair to Moscow." With him Ludwig Lewisohn, literary and
\par dramatic critic.
\par 
\par Back of us we detect young Burton Rascoe, former literary editor of the
\par Chicago Tribune, newly arrived in New York as managing editor of
\par _McCall's Magazine_, and to whom (by the way) the suppressed novel
\par "Jurgen" was dedicated. You wouldn't think anybody would be so frowning
\par as to want to suppress Mr. Rascoe. He looks as if he might be twin
\par brother to any dewy bud here.
\par 
\par Who is that he is with? Theodore Maynard, I declare. Young English poet,
\par critic and novelist. And the other side of him is a gentleman, Oliver
\par Saylor by name, who at the height of the revolution went to Russia to
\par study the Russian drama, and engrossed in \'e6sthetics lived for a time in
\par quarters midway between the contending military forces. Beyond we see a
\par young lady recently come on from Ted Shawn's song and dance studio in
\par Los Angeles.
\par 
\par And yonder you see a young man who is just as dear and sweet as he can
\par be. He served his country during the war by knitting a sweater and a
\par "helmet" for a poet he knew in the army in France. He, this dainty
\par youth, looks pretty much lip-sticked himself. In order not to sin
\par against daintiness this young person has a habit of powdering his nose.
\par A coarse friend of his forbade his doing this, and the next time he met
\par him neatly powdered rebuked him for it. Whereupon the young man replied:
\par "Oh! You wouldn't (would you?) let a little powder come between
\par friends."
\par 
\par And, finally, here most happily we are ourselves.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XVI
\par 
\par OUR STEEPLEJACK OF THE SEVEN ARTS
\par 
\par 
\par There is a rather frisky looking apartment house there now, a pastry
\par shop and tea room occupying the ground floor--behind it, the other side
\par of a venerable brick wall, a tiny, ancient burying ground. But in days
\par of yester-year here stood a tavern of renown, the Old Grape Vine, which
\par on this site, Sixth Avenue at Eleventh Street, had given cheer since
\par Sixth Avenue was little more than a country road. A sagging, soiled
\par white, two-story frame structure, with great iron grill lamps before the
\par door. Within, the main room was somewhat reminiscent of London's Olde
\par Cheshire Cheese.
\par 
\par The proprietor was a canny Scot, one MacClellan. ("Old Mac"! Whither has
\par he gone?) I was coming along by there the other day, and I asked a man
\par with whom I chanced to walk if he remembered the Old Grape Vine. "Ah!
\par yes;" he said; "they had mutton pies there." They did. And excellent
\par ale, also, served in battered pewter mugs. "They" had here, too (some
\par fifteen years ago), excellent society beneath the dingy light. Roaring,
\par roistering George Luks (as he was then) very much to the fore. At the
\par rickety mahogany table where Frans-Halsian George held forth frequently
\par was to be found the painter William J. Glackens and his brother "Lew,"
\par humorous draughtsman for _Puck_. Ernest Lawson sometimes came in. A Mr.
\par Zinzig, a very pleasant soul and an excellent pianist and teacher of the
\par piano, often was of the company. A Mr. FitzGerald, art critic in those
\par days of the _Sun_, sometimes "sat in." And a delightful old cock, Mr.
\par Stephenson, art critic then of the _Evening Post_. Among the most
\par devoted habitu\'e9s of the place was an old-school United States army
\par officer turned writer of military stories. (When the proceedings had
\par progressed to a certain stage of mellowness it was his habit to go home
\par and return directly arrayed in his uniform.) There was, too, a queer
\par figure of a derelict journalist associated with _Town Topics_. There was
\par an inoffensive gentleman of leisure whose distinction was that he was
\par brother to a famous Shakespearean scholar. (As the hour grew late he
\par would begin to whistle softly to himself through his teeth.) There was a
\par rotund being of much reading who perpetually smoked a very old pipe and
\par who was editor of a tobacco journal. There was a man of the sea who
\par continually told stories of Japan. (After eleven he was somewhat given
\par to singing.) There was an illustrator for a tu'penny magazine, who (so
\par as to seem to be a large staff) signed a variety of names to his work.
\par From the land of R. L. S., he. One time while in a doze (somewhere else)
\par he was robbed. His comment upon his misfortune became a classic line. It
\par was: "By heaven! As long as whiskey is sold to lose ten dollars is
\par enough to drive a Scot mad!" (This was long before anybody had ever
\par heard of the now illustrious Mr. Volstead.) And many more there were.
\par Ah, me! ah, me! How the picture has changed!
\par 
\par Well, the point of all this (if it have any point) is that it was in the
\par Old Grape Vine (of tender memory) that I first saw James Gibbons
\par Huneker. I think that, in his promenades as an impressionist, he was
\par there but seldom. Though we know that high among the Seven Arts he rated
\par the fine art of drinking Pilsner. The old places of Martin's and
\par L\'fcchow's (headquarters on a time for the musical cognoscenti) were ports
\par of call on his rounds; and he moved freely, I believe, among the places
\par of refreshment along the foreign quarter of lower Fourth Avenue. At the
\par Grape Vine, I understand, he was an especial friend of Luks, and
\par probably of Glackens and Lawson. And, though he was a very famous man,
\par he seemed to like the motley company.
\par 
\par Ten or twelve years ago I was earning a living more honestly than
\par perhaps I have been making one since. I was a clerk in a book store--the
\par retail department, it happened, of the house which publishes Mr.
\par Huneker's books. And there, from my position "on the floor," I
\par frequently saw him moving in and out. Moving rather slowly, with the
\par dignity of bulk. A distinguished figure, quietly but quite neatly
\par dressed, very erect in carriage, head held well back, supporting his
\par portliness with that physical pride of portly men, a physiognomy of
\par Rodinesque modelling--his cane a trim touch to the ensemble. He was, I
\par distinctly remember, held decidedly in regard by the retail staff
\par because he was (what, by a long shot, a good many "authors" were not)
\par exceedingly affable in manner to us clerks.
\par 
\par The moment I have particularly in mind was when Samuel Butler's volume
\par "The Way of All Flesh" first appeared in an American edition. We all
\par know all about Butler now. But, looking back, it certainly is
\par astonishing how innocent most all of us then were of any knowledge of
\par the great author of "Erewhon." Even so searching a student of literature
\par as W. C. Brownell was practically unacquainted with Butler. He was
\par taking home a copy of "The Way of All Flesh" to read. Mr. Huneker was
\par standing by. In some comment on the book he remarked that Butler had
\par been a painter. "A painter!" exclaimed Mr. Brownell, in a manner as
\par though wondering how it came about he knew so little of the man. "But
\par this," said Mr. Huneker, referring to the novel, "is not his best stuff.
\par That is in his note-books." Brownell: "And where are they?" Huneker: "In
\par the British Museum." Mr. Brownell made a fluttering gesture (as though
\par to express that he "gave up") toward Mr. Huneker: "He knows everything!"
\par he ejaculated.
\par 
\par We should, of course, be surprised now that anybody _did not_ know that
\par Butler had been a painter. When, just a short time ago, W. Somerset
\par Maugham adapted for the purposes of his sensational novel "The Moon and
\par Sixpence" the character and career of Paul Gauguin, it was in the pages
\par of Huneker that many first looked for, and found, intelligence
\par concerning the master of the Pont Aven school of painting. Well, Gauguin
\par is now an old story. And Ibsen, Tolstoy, Wagner, Richard Strauss,
\par Rimbaud, De Gourmont, Nietzsche, Meredith, Henry James, William James,
\par Bergson, Barr\'e8s, Anatole France, Flaubert, Lema\'eetre, Huysmans,
\par Maeterlinck, Baudelaire, Stirner, Strindberg, Faguet, Shaw, Wilde,
\par George Moore, Yeats, Synge, Schnitzler, Wederkind, Lafargue, Rodin,
\par C\'e9zane, Matisse, Picasso, Van Gogh, George Luks, that wondrous "flock of
\par Unicorns"--they all are old stories, too ... now. But it was our
\par Steeplejack, James Huneker, who was our pioneer watcher of the skies.
\par And what in the large sweep of his vision of the whole field of the
\par world's beauty he saw, he reported with infinite gusto. "Gusto," as H.
\par L. Mencken in the Huneker article of his "Book of Prefaces" says,
\par "unquenchable, contagious, inflammatory."
\par 
\par The extent of the personal contact which Mr. Huneker enjoyed and
\par maintained with the first-rate literary men of the world was amazing.
\par While I was with the book shop I speak of, "presentation copies" of each
\par new book of his, to be sent out "with the compliments of the author,"
\par were piled up for forwarding literally several feet high. They went to
\par all the great in letters, in every country, that you could think of.
\par Anatole France, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, George Brandes, Edmund
\par Gosse, George Moore--people like that.
\par 
\par Vast was the incoming stream of books to him, presentation copies,
\par review copies, "publicity" copies; so great a flood that it was
\par necessary for him periodically to call in an old book man to clear his
\par shelves by carting away a wagon-load or two of--genuine treasure. A
\par catalogue I one time saw of such volumes "from the library of James
\par Huneker" was sufficient in riches to have been the catalogue of the
\par entire stock of a very fair shop dealing in "association" volumes, first
\par editions, and so forth. And a survey of the books themselves made it
\par quite apparent that a reader who has read every word that Huneker ever
\par printed (and that would be a person who had read a good deal) may yet
\par (very likely) be a reader who has not read some of the best of Huneker.
\par I refer to "Jimmie's" humorous, pungent marginalia.
\par 
\par Mr. Huneker's close friends have taken occasion since his death to speak
\par warmly of his kindness toward obscure, struggling talent. There was a
\par side to him, akin to this, which I have not seen commented upon.
\par Huneker's fame as a critic had been for years accepted throughout
\par Europe. When his "New Cosmopolis" was published (a book I did not myself
\par think so highly of) Joyce Kilmer, then newly come to journalism,
\par reviewed it for the New York _Times_, very eulogistically. Mr. Huneker
\par went to the trouble of looking up Kilmer to thank him very simply for
\par his praise.
\par 
\par Mr. Huneker was a loyal and disinterested servant of good literature
\par wherever he found it, and his happily was the power to be an ambassador
\par to success. So short a time as about four years ago very few people had
\par heard of William McFee. "Aliens," his first book, had met with no
\par appreciable success. The manuscript of "Casuals of the Sea" (or the
\par English "sheets" of the book, I do not recall which) came into the hands
\par of a publishing house at Garden City. A member of the editorial staff of
\par this house at this time was Christopher Morley. And I happened at the
\par moment to have a job as sort of handy man at editorial chores around the
\par premises. Morley immediately became a great "fan" for the book.
\par Undoubtedly a fine book, and it was accepted, but (there was a question)
\par could it be "put across"? It was very long, not of obviously popular
\par character, and the author's name commanded no attention at all.
\par 
\par The first "advance" copy of the book sent out went (at Morley's
\par direction) to Mr. Huneker. He was then writing regularly critical
\par articles for something like a half dozen publications. "Casuals of the
\par Sea" (such things did not turn up every day) was a "find" for his
\par enthusiasm, He "pulled" two columns of brilliant Hunekerean firecrackers
\par about it in the New York _Sun_; wrote another article of length on the
\par book for the New York _Times_; gave the volume a couple of paragraphs of
\par mention in his department on the Seven Arts at that time running in
\par _Puck_, and perhaps mentioned the book elsewhere also. With the weight
\par of such fervor and authority "Casuals" was most auspiciously launched.
\par It could not now, by any chance, be passed by.
\par 
\par I do not, of course, mean to imply that there was anything artificial or
\par "manufactured" about the "vogue" of "Casuals." First, Mr. Huneker was
\par not a reviewer but a critic, if not thoroughly a great one, certainly a
\par very real one; and about the last man going who could be got to "push"
\par anything he did not whole-heartedly believe was fine. And secondly,
\par "Casuals" had "the goods."
\par 
\par Through my connection with the matter of "Casuals" I suppose it was that
\par a correspondence came about between Mr. Huneker and me. And in all my
\par days I have never seen so energetic a correspondent. It seems to me that
\par I got a letter from him about every other morning. I dropped out of the
\par publishing business and went to Indiana for a time. I let him know when
\par I got there, my motive in this being mainly to notify him that I _was_
\par out of the publishing business and so was no longer in a position to
\par give any business attention to letters relating to books. But letters
\par from him continued to reach me with the same regularity. While, I
\par hardly need say, I enjoyed this correspondence enormously, I was
\par decidedly embarrassed by it, as I could not but keenly feel that I was
\par taking up his time to no purpose. Still, of course, I felt that I should
\par answer each letter of his without an impolite delay, and no sooner did
\par he get my reply than he answered back again. Gradually, however, we got
\par the thing slowed down.
\par 
\par His letters were prodigal of witty things. I am afraid I have not kept
\par them; if so I do not know where they are--I move about a good deal. One
\par neat play of words I remember. I do not know whether or not he himself
\par ever used it elsewhere. I did use it in a book, giving due credit to Mr.
\par Huneker. I had told him that I was going in for writing on my own. His
\par comment was: "He that lives by the pen shall perish by the pen." Some of
\par his letters, I recall, were signed, "Jim, the Penman."
\par 
\par And it was no simple trick to read them. He used a pale ink. The
\par handwriting was small, curious, and to me almost illegible. Why
\par compositors did not mob him I do not know. He wrote everything by hand;
\par never would learn to use a typewriter, and declared that he could not
\par acquire the faculty of dictation.
\par 
\par This leads me to the story of one of the articles he contributed to _The
\par Bookman_. When, upon my return to New York, I became (for a time) editor
\par of this magazine I pursued him for contributions. Yes, later on he would
\par send us something, but always it was later on, later on. I had about
\par given up hope of ever getting anything from him when a bulky wad of
\par closely-written "copy" on yellow paper arrived. Expecting that it would
\par take me a couple of days to decipher the manuscript, I joyously
\par acknowledged receipt of it at once, without a thought of questioning the
\par nature of the article. When I tried to read the article, after I had
\par held the first page sidewise, next upside down, then examined it in a
\par mirror, I "passed the buck" and sent the copy straight on to the
\par printers. If printers had read him before printers ought to be able to
\par do so again. I advertised the article to appear in the next number of
\par the magazine. When I got the article back in galley proofs--I got a
\par jolt. It wasn't "_Bookman_ stuff" at all, all about a couple of "old
\par rounders," as Mr. Huneker called them, taking a stroll.
\par 
\par I do not think that Mr. Huneker has as yet since his death, to the time
\par these rambling remarks are being written, received anything like
\par adequate recognition in the press. The "obituary" articles in the
\par newspapers have carried the air that he was hardly more than an
\par excellent "newspaper man"--somewhat older, but something like (dare I
\par say?) Heywood Broun or Alexander Woollcott. Ah! no; James Huneker was a
\par critic and an artist, and a figure, too, in our national life. Though he
\par was all his days until almost his last breath a hard-working journalist
\par with an immediate "copy date" before him. And though he most naturally
\par thought of himself, with common-sense pride in his calling, as a
\par journalist. I remember his one time speaking of Arnold Bennett as "a
\par hard-working journalist as well as a novel writer." Indicating his great
\par esteem for the character of journalist. And he used to speak, too, with
\par fraternal pride and affection in inflection, of young men who had
\par written good books, as being among "our men," meaning associated with
\par the same paper as himself.
\par 
\par At the remarkable funeral service held in the new Town Hall in New York
\par high and touching honor was done his memory by the stage and the musical
\par profession, but literature seemed to be officially represented by the
\par person of Richard Le Gallienne alone, and painting and sculpture not at
\par all. The articles by Mr. Huneker's colleagues among music critics have
\par seemed very largely to claim him as quite their own. True, no doubt, his
\par most penetrating writing was done in the field of musical criticism.
\par But, also, Huneker was an evangel who belongs to the Seven Arts.
\par 
\par One thing should be added. It is a sad thing, but it is of the nature of
\par life. A good editorial in _The New Republic_ began: "James Huneker named
\par one of his best books 'The Pathos of Distance.' In a single day his own
\par figure is invested with the memorial gentleness there described." No,
\par not altogether in a single day. He had already begun, and more than
\par begun, to recede into the pathos of distance. His _flair_ was for the
\par championship and interpretation of the "new" men. And, for the most
\par part, his new men had become old men. His stoutest admirer must admit
\par that Mr. Huneker's work was "dated."
\par 
\par But where (and this is sadder still) is his like today?
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XVII
\par 
\par FORMER TENANT OF HIS ROOM
\par 
\par 
\par There are certain things which must be done, to yield their best, when
\par one is young. For one thing, there is only one time in life to run away
\par to sea. If you did not run away to sea when you were a lad, it is too
\par late now for you to get any sport out of it. 'Tis something the same
\par with living in a garret or in a hall bedroom. If you did not read
\par "Robinson Crusoe" when you were a boy there is no use for you to read it
\par now; you will not understand it. There are some other things you can
\par enjoy when you are old--grandchildren, for instance. But the time to
\par come up to a great city is when one is young. The time to walk up
\par Broadway at night, and feel a gusto about it, and Fifth Avenue by day,
\par is when one is young. That is an enchanted time, when it is a fine
\par dashing thing to be doing, to live at a second-rate boarding house; when
\par discouragement is adventure; when it is worth while even to be poor;
\par when one makes life-long friends at sight; when young love is sipped;
\par when courage is ever stout in one's breast; when one's illusions are
\par virgin yet; and all's right with the world. At that season one can swell
\par with a rich personal pride in "Shanley's" and, almost at the same time,
\par eat one's own theatre supper in a "Dairy Lunch" room, where every
\par customer is his own waiter as well, and where his table is the broadened
\par arm of his chair against the wall.
\par 
\par Richard Day, student at the law, munched his egg sandwich (egg sandwich
\par was the favorite dish at the "Dairy Lunches" until eggs got so high) and
\par drank his coffee from a cup that remarkably resembled in shape a shaving
\par mug and was decorated in similar fashion. The blocks of sugar (two for
\par Richard) for this stimulating beverage (made out of chicory) were taken
\par by the customer with his fingers from a heaping-full sort of great
\par punch-bowl mounted on a pedestal in the middle of the room. It was drawn
\par from a nickel-plated engine with glass tubes by a young man in a white
\par coat like a barber's, who served it, with crullers, piece of pie, or
\par sandwich, across a kind of little bar at the rear end of the long room.
\par 
\par Day scorned the packed, parading trolley cars, and swung vigorously up
\par the street. Far up the thoroughfare an enormous electric sign (in its
\par size suggesting that it had been somehow brought back by Gulliver from
\par the country of Brobdingnag and mounted here upon a sturdy little
\par building for awful exhibition) its gigantic illuminated letters spelling
\par "Arthur Pendennis Ten Cent Cigar," lighted the mist for blocks
\par approaching it, and marked the north boundary of the dominion for
\par revelry. The sidewalks were much quieter now. One of those birds of the
\par urban night deftly wheeled his vehicle alongside our pedestrian and
\par pulled his clattering quadruped violently back upon its haunches until
\par it slid along the slippery pavement. "Cab, sir? Cab?" Then he whisked
\par away again. It was not long before Richard had entered into the district
\par of slumbering residences, and not much longer until he ran up the steps
\par before his own door, or, speaking more literally, his own landlady's
\par door. It is not much to mount three pairs of stairs in the brave days
\par when one is twenty-one, and Day was in the little room, where, rich only
\par in the glory of his rising sun, in his youth, he weathered it so long.
\par 
\par This apartment was the width of the dark hall, which was face to face
\par with it, about fourteen feet long, and furnished in tune, so to speak.
\par An uncommonly small, old-fashioned, wooden bedstead, a bantam-size
\par "dresser," a washstand its shorter brother, a small table or "stand,"
\par and two half-grown chairs, mature before their season, were the
\par principal articles of furniture. The room was heated by an oil stove
\par that had passed the age of vanity in one's appearance; it was lighted at
\par night by a gas-jet, without a globe; by day through a single window,
\par which occupied between a half and a third of the wall space of the front
\par end of the room, and which balanced in decorative effect with the door
\par at the other end. A row of books was arranged along the dresser top
\par against the lower part of the small looking-glass. Two pictures (the
\par property of Day), one of Lincoln and one of Roosevelt squinting in the
\par sunlight (this is a land where every young man may hope to be
\par President), were tacked on the walls. In company with these were a
\par combination calendar and fire-insurance advertisement and a card
\par displaying a lithographed upper part and idealistic legs of a blithe
\par young woman wearing, stuck on, a short, bright skirt made of sandpaper
\par and streaked with match-scratches, who in fancy letters was ingeniously
\par labelled "A Striking Girl." These bits of applied art were properties of
\par Mrs. Knoll's establishment.
\par 
\par Day's dresser had several small drawers and a little square door. He had
\par one day discovered adhering to the back of this door a hardened piece of
\par chewing gum, and from this he had deduced that a former tenant of the
\par room had been a woman, presumably a young one (for surely there is an
\par age after which one knows better). He sometimes speculated on the
\par subject of the former tenant, and he was of three minds about her
\par vocation. Sometimes he thought she had been a school-teacher, sometimes
\par he thought an art student, and again a clerk in a store. He
\par reconstructed her as having had red hair and having been a bit frowsy.
\par But whatever she had been she had slept on a mighty hard little bed, and
\par he felt something like a tenderness for her on that account.
\par 
\par When he had got home from the theatre, Richard sat on the edge of his
\par bed (it seemed always somehow the most natural place in the room to
\par sit), and smoked his pipe. One Christmas Day he and his bosom friend had
\par gone together and bought pipes exactly alike, then each had given his
\par to the other. Years later Day was compelled to give up smoking, and he
\par was never exactly the same again. But when he was young the gods blessed
\par him. He smoked his pipe out, then he slowly pulled off his shoes. That
\par is, he pulled off one shoe and sat abstractedly a considerable while
\par with it in his hand. He had many thoughts, mainly associated with an
\par unknown young lady he had seen that evening at the theatre. He wished he
\par had had on a different style of collar--and he would have had if his
\par laundryman had kept his word. However, he thought rather sadly what
\par booted it to him now. Then he roused himself, slowly undressed, put on
\par his pajamas (his mother had made them for him), turned off his light,
\par pulled up his window curtain (so the morning light would waken him), and
\par got into bed.
\par 
\par Richard fell into a great many adventures in his night's sleep. He
\par fought bandits, with never any cartridges in his gun; he travelled
\par across plains that appeared to be constructed on the principle of a
\par treadmill; he visited sundry peculiar places and did divers queer things
\par with solemnity and without surprise. After a while it seemed to him
\par that he was somewhere talking with, or rather to, the former tenant of
\par his room. But the former tenant did not have red hair; her hair was the
\par loveliest brown; nor was she the least bit frowzy; she was the very
\par opposite extreme to that. Nor clerk nor teacher nor student was she. She
\par was a bright princess. Her complexion had rather more of the rose than
\par of the lily. Her pure and eloquent blood spoke in her cheeks. She and
\par the lady he had seen at the theatre were one and the same person. He
\par could not make out exactly how he came to know she was the former
\par tenant, but that seemed to be considered so very well understood he felt
\par ashamed to speak about it.
\par 
\par He was saying to her some of the cleverest things he had ever heard. He
\par surprised himself as he listened to himself; and he was much elated; for
\par if ever he wished to speak well, now was the time. Now Day was really a
\par very clever fellow, as well as a comely one (this is only a story of his
\par youth, but in after life he became a distinguished man), and, like all
\par very clever fellows, he was never perfectly happy except when his
\par talents were recognized and appreciated. Here in his dream he had come
\par into his own. It was a night to be marked with a white stone. One of the
\par things that particularly impressed him in this dream was his impression
\par that it was not a dream.
\par 
\par In the morning it was always colder in Day's room than at night, and
\par always it seemed somehow lonesomer. It was bare then, and not cozy. To
\par come directly from such an especially comfortable dream into the cold,
\par grey dawn, and find one's window opaque with frost and one's breath like
\par steam in the air, requires a little time for one to adjust oneself to
\par the transition. Richard lay a little time generating courage to get up.
\par He did not immediately shake off his dream entirely; but crumbs of it
\par stuck to his mind, like the last of a fine cake on the face. But it was
\par as if his cake had turned cold in the mouth. He squirmed in bed with
\par embarrassment when he reviewed those clever things, on which he had so
\par plumed himself, that he had said to the former tenant. They were so very
\par poor and flat that he tried to stop his mind against the recollection of
\par them. And even the former tenant herself, as she faded now more into the
\par night, and he came more out into the morning, was like Cinderella as
\par she fled from the hall back to her kitchen. But Richard caught up the
\par crystal slipper that remained to him and in his bosom bore it forth into
\par the day.
\par

\par 
\par CHAPTER XVIII
\par 
\par ONLY SHE WAS THERE
\par 
\par 
\par Directly in the intense emphasis of white light from an arc lamp
\par overhead, and standing about midway in the long, dark, thickly-packed
\par line of people waiting, was a young man decidedly above the middle
\par stature, in a long outer coat. He was broad in the shoulders, formed in
\par excellent proportion, apparently in about the first or second and
\par twentieth year of his age. His forehead was intelligent, his nose
\par exceptionally good, his mouth rather big and lips full, his chin round
\par and with a cleft in the centre. His hair, chestnut, moderately cropped,
\par discovered, what of it was visible below his hat, a decided inclination
\par to curl. He was redolent of health and the unmined masculine vigor
\par pertaining to his time of life. As the earliest ancestor of this kind of
\par historical writing would have said, "He was one of the handsomest young
\par fellows that hath ever been seen"; in short, he was not unlike one
\par Jones, Christian-named Tom. This young man was Richard Day, student of
\par the law, and he had come from his silent "furnished room" to refresh
\par himself, at a minimum cost, at the dramatic presentation of an immortal
\par story of love.
\par 
\par On the occasions when the entertainment to be is of a superior order,
\par the price of admission is doubled or trebled, and the patrons of the
\par theatre gallery are of an exceptional character. They comprise school
\par teachers in abundance, miscellaneous students, matin\'e9e girls driven high
\par by the prohibitory prices below, young clerks, and a sprinkling from the
\par usual ranks of the gallery-god, the better sort of them, however, the
\par more wealthy and more aspiring. The original line containing Richard Day
\par had assembled an hour or so before time, to be on the spot at the
\par opening of the doors at a commendable production of "Romeo and Juliet."
\par 
\par There came a sudden jolting, like the coupling of railroad cars, then a
\par denser packing of the line, a being pushed off one's balance and being
\par pressed back into it again, and slowly, jerkily, the crowd began to move
\par forward; then swept toward the entrance. The doors had been opened. As
\par the throng began to move, a woman's voice rose near Day ejaculating
\par breathlessly, "Oh! Oh!" Simultaneously a shrill cry arose, "Oh, there's
\par a sick lady here! a sick lady! Oh, please! Oh, please! Won't you make
\par room for a sick lady!" Day with all his force made what room he could,
\par conceiving that the thing desired was to get the stricken lady out in
\par the open as quickly as possible. A little peaked woman in a light coat
\par took instant advantage of the slight breach then opened, impetuously to
\par advance herself in the line. When the momentary gap had closed again,
\par piteously the crying was resumed, and it continued at intervals almost
\par the entire distance to the box-office, though it was in a slightly
\par different neighborhood and observably proceeded from exactly the point
\par of vantage gained by the little peaked woman; who, it might be inferred,
\par was a dual personality, comprising in the same lady both a sick lady and
\par another who was her good Samaritan and assumed the care of her.
\par 
\par Nothing railed the crowd into a straight line on one side, though on the
\par other a wall held them so. The impatient crowding forward from the rear
\par convexed the outer edge of the line of people, much against the will of
\par those persons who found themselves being swept out of the direct way
\par and felt the main current surging past them. What was yet more agitating
\par to these was that ahead of them an iron railing did begin, at the foot
\par of some steps, fencing in a narrow approach to the ticket office. If
\par they should be swept past the mouth of this lane on the outside, their
\par chance of admittance was hopeless. Day stemmed the swerving current
\par himself by the strength of his body and by a kind of determined exercise
\par of his will. But he felt directly behind him someone less strong losing
\par hold with every step of advance; then suddenly this despairing someone,
\par realizing herself pushed quite to one side, with a little scream, caught
\par at his crooked arm; which he instantly, involuntarily clapped firmly
\par against him, hooking on in this manner and towing safely and rapidly
\par along someone frailer than himself. When they had come to the rail he
\par saw that he would get in by so narrow a margin himself that, himself
\par inside, he would then but tow her along outside, which of course would
\par be a less than useless thing for her. So he backed water, so to speak,
\par with all his might, bracing himself against the end of the rail, until
\par he had got a little space before him, around into which he drew her
\par whom he thought robbed of her place by the frantic selfishness of the
\par crowd.
\par 
\par But in doing this, it seemed he had inadvertently held back for a moment
\par the little peaked woman, who was at his inside elbow. She, finding
\par herself delayed for a brief period almost at the goal in her desperate
\par bargain-counter sort of rush for the ticket-window, blew out into a
\par spitting cat kind of impotent fury. "Ain't you got no semblance of
\par decency! you great big brute!" she screamed in his ear. "Ain't you got
\par no ideas of gentlemanliness at all! If I was a man I'd teach you some
\par shame, tramplin' on a woman, a poor weak woman! a woman!" She fairly
\par writhed with scorn at this depravity. Day attempted to humble himself to
\par her, for her pacification; but another woman's getting in ahead of her
\par at that instant drove her almost mad, and her frenzy interfering for the
\par moment with her articulation she could only glare at him with an
\par expression suggesting some kind of feline hydrophobia. When her breath
\par returned more to her command she continued to revile him as they went
\par along. Although Day had done nothing to merit shame, he squirmed
\par inwardly with something not unlike that feeling, and he blessed the
\par general commotion which drowned a vixen's voice. He felt ashamed, too,
\par to be where he was, though he had not thought of it that way before; he
\par should not have brought himself into a crowd more than half of women.
\par 
\par His reflections became rather abstract and levelled themselves somewhat
\par against the feminine temperament in general. He felt the littleness of
\par it (so he saw it), the peevishness of it; its inability to take
\par punishment good-naturedly; its incapacity for being a "good loser"; its
\par lack of the philosophic character which accepts humorously discomforts
\par and injustice, real as well as imagined; its lack of broadness of view;
\par its selfish lack of the sense of fair play; its
\par not-being-square-and-above-board way; its sneakiness, its deceitfulness;
\par the contemptible devices that it will resort to, assuming them to be its
\par natural weapons against a superior strength, both physical and of the
\par understanding. He knew that in a crowd of men if anyone of them had had
\par the despicable disposition of this woman his dread of the hearty,
\par boisterous ridicule of his fellow brutes which would inevitably have
\par followed his meanness would have forced him to stifle his temptation in
\par silence. He knew that there is no place where one may better learn to
\par appreciate what may be called the good-natured easy-goingness of the
\par male animal generally than in an uncomfortable crowd of men. He thanked
\par heaven he was of the superior sex. When a young man thanks heaven that
\par he is of the superior sex it may not be uninteresting to observe in what
\par manner he conducts himself subsequently.
\par 
\par As fast as the crowd was served with tickets it ran up the multiplied
\par flights of stairs, moved in single file past the ticket-chopper, then on
\par to come out, high up, into the vast bowl of the theatre. Here from one's
\par seat the impression of the weird, ship-at-sea like effect of the curves
\par of the galleries, balconies, and tiers of boxes, sweeping back from the
\par light in front, dropping away from the vaulted ceiling; the impression
\par of being high up close under a great roof and far from the stage; the
\par impression of the myriads of vague elusive faces in the half-lit, thick,
\par scintillating atmosphere of the hot, crowded place; the impression of
\par the playhouse scheme of decoration, red walls and tinsel in the dusk,
\par cream color and tinsel bas-relief in the highly artificial yellow light,
\par casting purplest shadows, and the heroic mural paintings in blue and
\par yellow and green, the sense of the infinite moving particles of the
\par throng; the sense of its all facing one way, of the low hum of it, and
\par of its respiration--all this is stuff that puts one in the mood for a
\par play. The keen actualities fade and become the shadows; sense of one's
\par own life and vanity and disappointment slips away; one is to enjoy a
\par transmigration of soul for a brief time. "Now for the play!" thought
\par Richard.
\par 
\par A man was climbing up the steps of the aisle, some distance away,
\par flinging an inadequate number of fluttering programs into the crowd.
\par None fell in Day's neighborhood, to the indignant consternation of all
\par there. A chorus of exclamatory sighs went up from a feminine flock just
\par settled at his right, all faces following the disappointing program
\par distributor. A stocky young man at Day's left hand arose, and clambering
\par out between the parallel two rows of seats, occupants getting on their
\par feet to allow him passage, started after the disappearing man of
\par programs.
\par 
\par A full-throated feminine voice burst almost in Day's right ear: "Oh,
\par please tell him to get one for us!" Day lunged after the stocky young
\par man, reaching for his coat-tails, and cried out, "Hey there! Hey!
\par Fellow! Hold on!" until it was quite hopeless to continue. The sea of
\par people closed in between him and his quest; the stocky young man, his
\par ears plugged with the multitude of voices, shook himself free from the
\par narow, clogged passage, and was gone. Day turned to the owner of the
\par feminine voice, "He will bring a lot, I think; if not I'll get you
\par some," he said. And he caught an elusive impression of cheeks precisely
\par the color of cheeks that had just been smartly slapped, suggesting the
\par idea that if one should press one's finger against them one's finger
\par would leave streaks there when taken away; and he caught an impression
\par of eyes that were like deep, brimming pools reflecting lights; and an
\par impression of a cloud of dusky brown-like hair which reminded him of a
\par host of rich autumn leaves. She of these cheeks and eyes and this hair
\par was, apparently, in a party with two companions, whose peering faces
\par showed indistinctly beyond her. In one significance of the word, she
\par might have been called a girl, or she was a young woman, a miss, a lass,
\par a young lady, as you please; as were they her companions. Merry
\par school-girl spirits lingered in them all, supplemented by the grace and
\par dawning dignity of young womanhood. She was at that sweet nosegay
\par period when young ladies are just, as it is sometimes said, finishing
\par their education. Her age was that enchanted time, holiest of the female
\par seasons, which hangs between mature girlhood and full womanhood. Day
\par felt a suspicion, though without perceptible foundation, that this was
\par the very person he had towed along outside.
\par 
\par The stocky young man returned presently, showing an uncommonly blunt
\par face and with the programs, which proved sufficient in number. There was
\par an interval in which to read them; then the huge place fell suddenly
\par much darker, except directly to the fore, which burst into great light;
\par the immense curtain majestically ascended, and the time was that of the
\par quarrels of the houses of Capulet and Montague in the sixteenth century.
\par Richard Day passed out of his body sitting upright on the seat and lived
\par in this incarnation of the master dramatist.
\par 
\par But unwittingly he had inhaled a liquor, that was even then feeding his
\par blood; he was even then continuing to inhale it; it crept in at the
\par pores of his right side; it was stealing its sweet breath about his
\par brain. This liquor was the magnetism of a powerful pleasant young
\par feminine presence near to him--too near. Too near for a clean-cut young
\par man, in his second and twentieth year, redolent of health, with
\par moderately cropped chestnut hair inclined to curl, intelligent forehead,
\par good nose, rather big mouth, full lips, and round chin with a cleft in
\par the centre--too near for him even to remain in the hands of the master
\par dramatist. A warm glow suffused him. His intellectual perception of the
\par illuminated, noble spectacle before him in a frame of night numbed in
\par his brain and he was conscious only of the rich sensation that
\par circulated through him. Metaphorically, senses and emotions lolled on
\par rich colored divans, spread with thick rugs, in the tropical atmosphere
\par of his head. The magically spoken lines of Shakespeare became as so much
\par unfelt, unrecognized, distant sounding jargon. What he had come to be
\par thrilled by, as the dark, breathless audience like a sea about him was
\par thrilled, was in a moment nothing to him. And yet he had not touched
\par her, nor again spoken with her, nor glanced at her.
\par 
\par Only she was there!
\par 
\par

\par 
\par CHAPTER XIX
\par 
\par A HUMORIST'S NOTE-BOOK
\par 
\par 
\par I admit that (though, indeed, I can claim a very fair collection of
\par authors as acquaintances) I share the popular interest in the
\par idiosyncratic nature of the literary profession. I am as curious as to
\par the occult workings of the minds of authors, the esoteric process by
\par which subtle insinuations of inspiration are translated into works of
\par literary art, as though I had never seen an author--off a platform. I
\par would read the riddle of genius. I am fascinated by its impenetrable
\par mysteries. I would explore the recesses of the creative head.
\par 
\par Therefore, in the presence of the treasure of such incalculable value
\par which is before me, I experience tense intellectual excitement. In the
\par thought of its possession by myself I find the uttermost felicity. What
\par it is is this: it is _a humorous writer's note-book_.
\par 
\par I must tell you the wonderful story--how this came into my hands, and
\par how, romantically enough, it is, so to say, by the bequest of the author
\par himself, your own possession. The strange circumstances are as follows:
\par 
\par Something like a week ago I received through the post at my place of
\par residence an oblong package. It was similar in shape to an ordinary
\par brick; not so heavy, and somewhat larger. I had ordered nothing from a
\par shop, and so, as the parcel was plainly addressed to myself, I concluded
\par that it must contain a present. As I am very fond of presents, I was,
\par with much eagerness, about to open the package, when I suddenly
\par recollected the newspaper reports of the recent dastardly Bolshevist
\par bomb plots; the sending through the mails, by some apparently organized
\par agency, to prominent persons in all parts of the country these
\par skillfully disguised engines of death and destruction. They were
\par outwardly, I recalled, innocent looking parcels, which when opened blew
\par housemaids to bits, demolished dwellings and, in some instances,
\par accomplished the murder of the personage who had incurred the enmity of
\par the criminals.
\par 
\par I bounded some considerable distance away from the object before me.
\par Though, after a moment, I did, indeed, reflect that I was not what
\par would probably be regarded as an eminent citizen, and had never felt a
\par sense of power in the government of my country, I could not dissolve a
\par decided distaste toward my undoing this mysterious parcel. Also I did
\par not enjoy seeing it remain there on my table. And, further, I had no
\par inclination to carry it from the room.
\par 
\par In this dilemma it occurred to me to summon the janitor of the apartment
\par house where I reside. When I had explained to him that, because of my
\par having a sore thumb (which made it painful for me to handle things), I
\par wished him to open this package for me--, when I had explained this to
\par him, he told me that he was very much occupied at the moment mending the
\par boiler downstairs, and that he must hasten to this occupation, otherwise
\par the lower floors would shortly be flooded. And he withdrew without
\par further ceremony.
\par 
\par I sat down to consider the situation. I realized that it was a
\par bothersome moral responsibility--placing the lives of others (even if
\par janitors) in jeopardy. But something must be done; and done
\par soon--perhaps there was a time fuse in this thing. A thought came to me
\par (the buzzer of our dumb-waiter sounded at the moment); I decided to go
\par further down the scale in the value of human life to be risked. So I
\par communicated down the shaft to our iceman (one Jack) that I desired his
\par presence in the apartment. Well, the upshot of the matter is that Jack
\par showed no hesitation whatever about coolly putting the package in a pail
\par of water and afterward undoing it.
\par 
\par The parcel proved to be an ordinary cigar-box (labelled outside, in the
\par decorative fashion of cigar-box labels, "Angels of Commerce"); within
\par was a letter resting upon a note-book, and beneath that the manuscripts
\par of two short stories. The submersion of the box would have (most
\par disastrously) obliterated, or gone near to obliterating, the message of
\par the letter and the writing in the note-book and the manuscript, had not
\par (happily) these things been packed tightly into the box by surrounding
\par waste paper.
\par 
\par The letter was from Taffy Topaz, known to us all--a humorist if there
\par ever was one. I cannot say that I had been on intimate terms with Mr.
\par Topaz; indeed (to admit the truth) all my acquaintance with authors is
\par slight. I admire authors so much that it is the joy of my life to be
\par acceptable to them in any degree. I put myself in their way at every
\par opportunity. I regard it as a great privilege (as, certainly, it is) to
\par spend freely of my income in entertaining them at meals. And in this way
\par and that it is that I have attained the honor of hobnobbing with a
\par number of writers, when they are not otherwise engaged.
\par 
\par As I say, I had not been on intimate terms with Mr. Topaz; and so I was
\par no little surprised (and, I admit, no little flattered) at this decided
\par attention (whatever it might mean) to me. The letter was not (oh, not at
\par all!) a humorous letter. It was a very solemn letter. It said that Mr.
\par Topaz was just about to go to the war. I was, naturally, puzzled at
\par this: the war is (theoretically) over. I hunted round and found a piece
\par of the wrapping paper which had enclosed the box. On it was the postmark
\par (the paper had dried somewhat); and the stamp bore the date of October
\par 1, 1917. I was still more puzzled as to where the box could have been
\par all this while. Then, I recollected the heroic labors of the post-office
\par in maintaining any kind of a schedule of delivery during the war. My
\par poor friend's box had been goodness knows where all this time!
\par 
\par The letter stated (as I have said) that Mr. Topaz was about to go to
\par the war--as a newspaper correspondent. It said (oh, it almost made one
\par weep, so solemn was it!) that he might never return from "over there."
\par In case he did not come back (the letter continued), he (Mr. Topaz)
\par wished me to undertake the charge of placing the enclosed manuscripts
\par with some magazine or magazines; the money got from them, though it was
\par inadequate he knew (so he said), he prayed that I would accept as
\par payment for the advances which I had made him from time to time. (Alas!
\par my poor friend, what were those miserable loans compared to the wealth
\par of his society! How I remember that proud day when he called me, so
\par pal-like, a "poor fish"!) But this is not a time to indulge one's grief;
\par I must press on with my story.
\par 
\par The remainder of his literary effects, he said (meaning, of course, the
\par note-book), he desired me (as he knew I had some connection with a
\par certain magazine) to present to the editor of that journal. Little more
\par remains to be said here of Mr. Topaz (my friend). He was not called upon
\par to lay down his life for his country (or his paper); after the armistice
\par he went valiantly into Germany; and there (as the papers have reported)
\par he contracted a marriage; and is little likely again to be seen in these
\par parts.
\par 
\par The first page of the note-book contains these entries. It is headed
\par 
\par     JOTTINGS
\par

\par "Among all the ingenious engines which man has contrived for his
\par ornament and protection none, certainly, is more richly idiosyncratic
\par than the umbrella. Literary genius has always instinctively recognized
\par this; and doubtless the esoteric fact has been vaguely felt even by the
\par unthinking; but it is a profound truth which, I fear, has had but slight
\par popular appreciation.
\par 
\par "The use of this historic and peculiarly eloquent article of personal
\par property, the umbrella, illustrates pictorially a proverbial allusion to
\par the manifestation of intelligence: it shows that a man has 'sense enough
\par to go in out of the rain.' It reveals not only the profundity of his
\par judgment but the extraordinary play of his cleverness, as it exhibits
\par him as the only animal who after crawling into his hole, figuratively
\par speaking, pulls his hole in after him, or, in other words, carries his
\par roof with him. Further than this, in the idea of carrying an umbrella
\par you find the secret of man's striking success in the world: the
\par intrepidity of his spirit in his tenacious pursuit of his own affairs
\par defies both the black cloud's downpour and the sun's hot eye."

\par Among the longer entries in this note-book is the following remarkable
\par psychological study, having as its title
\par 
\par     TEMPERAMENT
\par 
\par "That morning Kendle had seen himself famous. As he worked he began to
\par feel good in his brain and in his heart and in his stomach. He felt
\par virile, elated, full of power, and strangely happy. The joy of creating
\par a thing of art was upon him. Thrills ran down his spine and into his
\par legs. As he looked at his work he admired it. He knew that this was good
\par art. He felt that here was genius. He saw himself in a delectable
\par picture, an idol applauded of the multitude, and loved by it. For he
\par believed that the multitude was born, and ate and slept, and squabbled
\par among itself, and acquired property, and begot offspring, but to await
\par the arrival of genius. And the only genius he knew was genius in
\par eccentric painting. The only genius worth while that is, for there is a
\par genius that invents labor-saving machines, telephones, X-rays, and so
\par forth; but nobody loves that genius. It occurred to him that he was a
\par very lovable man, with all his faults (his faults were the lovable ones
\par of genius), and he would soon have achieved a distinction that would
\par make any woman proud of him. He determined to renew his addresses
\par to----.
\par 
\par "Somehow in the evening his intoxication had died down. He felt very
\par sad. His work lay before him with so little eccentricity to it that he
\par was ashamed. His sense of power had quite departed. And now he dismally
\par felt that he would never amount to anything. He was a failure. An idle,
\par wicked, disgraceful fellow, no good in the world, and not worth any
\par woman's attention. His heart felt sick when he thought this. He was very
\par miserable. He despised himself. So he sighed. It would have been better,
\par he thought, if he had apprenticed himself to the plumber's trade in his
\par boyhood. He would in that case have grown up happy and contented,
\par remained at home and done his duty, respected by his neighbors and
\par himself, though only a plumber. A plumber is a good honest man that pays
\par his debts.
\par 
\par "At home! Why was he not there, anyway? What good was he doing away from
\par there? There was his mother, in her declining years. Was his place not
\par by her side? He would never desert his mother, he thought. And Sis!
\par there was Sis. He would never desert Sis. How good they had been to him!
\par How they believed in him! (he squirmed) how they believed in him still.
\par He imagined them showing his most sensible pictures around to the
\par neighbors. 'My son is an artist,' he heard his mother say. His flesh
\par crawled. How mad he had been! How contemptible he was! Still a man was
\par not hopeless who had a soul for such feelings as he had now. He would
\par reform. He would henceforth eschew the company of such as Walker. He
\par enumerated his vices and renounced them one by one. He began life over
\par again. He would bask in the simple domestic pleasures of his mother in
\par her declining years, and Sis. He would get up very early every morning
\par and go to his humble toil before it was quite light. He felt himself
\par walking along in the chill of dawn--the street lamps still lit. He would
\par work hard all day. He would always tell the truth. Every Saturday night
\par he would come home tired out, with fifteen dollars in his pocket. This
\par he would throw into his mother's lap. 'Here, mother,' he would say in a
\par fine manly voice, 'here are fifteen dollars.' His mother would put her
\par apron to her eyes, and look at him through tears of pride and joy. He
\par would wear old clothes and be very honest and upright looking, the sort
\par of young man that Russell Sage would have approved, that Sis might
\par dress. He would not mind the sneers and gibes of the world, for he would
\par be _right_.
\par 
\par "He looked defiantly around the room for a few sneers and gibes."

\par 
\par INCLUDING STUDIES OF TRAFFIC "COPS"
\par 
\par 
\par The other day it was such a pleasant April day I thought I'd take the
\par afternoon off. It was such a very pleasant day that I didn't want to go
\par anywhere in particular. Do you ever feel that way? I mean like you just
\par wanted to be by yourself and sit down and think awhile.
\par 
\par Later on, you have an idea, you'll come back into things much refreshed.
\par But the thought of answering these letters now, or of doing this or
\par doing that, kind of lets you down inside your stomach. Your brain seems
\par to have dropped down somewhere behind your ears. If that fellow across
\par the office comes over to pull another of his bright ideas on you you
\par think you'll probably scream, or brain him, or something. He's getting
\par terrible, anyhow.
\par 
\par You have any number of excellent friends, and (ordinarily) you are quite
\par fond of them. Perhaps you will go to see one of them. There's Ed, you've
\par been wanting for you don't know how long to go round and see him. Never
\par seemed to have time. But no; you don't want to see Ed--today. Same way
\par with all the others, as you go over the list of them in your mind.
\par Couldn't bear to see any of 'em--not this afternoon. For one thing,
\par they're all so selfish.... So interested in their own affairs.
\par 
\par As I was straightening up my desk an idea came to me about jobs. Seems
\par to me that when I have a job I'm all the while worrying about how to
\par break out of it. I think: Well, I'm tied up here until the first of the
\par year; but I'll sure shake it after that; too cramped and limited. And
\par then when I am out of a job I immediately begin to worry about how to
\par get another one. That's Life, I guess.
\par 
\par I turned uptown and floated along with the current of the Avenue throng.
\par It was a glittering April throng. The newest stockings were out. I had
\par not seen them before. The newest stockings (you will have noted) are so
\par very, very thin and the pores (so to say) in them are so large that they
\par give the ladies who wear them the agreeable effect of being bare-legged.
\par 
\par At Thirty-fourth Street the traffic policeman on post at our side of
\par this corner, by an outward gesture of his arms pressed back the
\par sidewalk stream for a couple of moments of cross-town vehicular traffic.
\par He stood within a few inches of the front row of the largely feminine
\par crush. Whenever an impatient pedestrian broke through the line he had
\par formed and attempted to dart across the street he emitted a peculiar
\par little whistle followed by the admonishment, "Hold on, lady!" or "Hey
\par there, mister!" Thus having returned the derelict to cover, he would
\par smile very intimately, with a kind of sly cuteness, at the more handsome
\par young women directly before him--who invariably tittered back at him.
\par And thus, frequently, a little conversation was started.
\par 
\par Now as a vigilant historian of the social scene this matter of the
\par gallant relations of traffic policemen to perambulating ladies of
\par somewhat fashionable, even patrician aspect, I find highly interesting.
\par It is a subject which does not seem to have been much examined into.
\par 
\par Why, exactly, should flowers of d\'e9butante-Bryn-Mawr appearance look with
\par something like tenderness at policemen? Seems to me I have read now and
\par then in the papers strikingly romantic stories wherein a mounted
\par policeman in the park (formerly a cowboy) saved the life of an
\par equestrienne heiress on a runaway mount, and was rewarded the next day
\par (or something like that) with her hand. Such a story my mind always
\par gladly accepts as one of the dramatic instances where life artistically
\par imitates the movies. Crossing Thirty-fourth Street, however, seems to me
\par another matter.
\par 
\par And what system of selection operates in the Department whereby this
\par officer or that is chosen from among all his brethren for the
\par paradisaical job of being beau of a fashionable crossing? And would you
\par not think that a more uniform judgment would be exercised in the
\par election of men to such Brummellian duties? Adonises in the traffic
\par force I have, indeed, seen (there is one at Forty-second Street), but
\par this chap of whom I have just been speaking (the whimsical whistler)
\par certainly was not one of them. He was what is called "pie-faced."
\par Hunched up his shoulders like an owl. Yet his ogling of loveliness in
\par new spring attire was completely successful, was in no instance that I
\par observed resented, was received with arch merriment. Indeed, his heavy,
\par pink-tea attentions were obviously regarded as quite flattering by the
\par fair recipients! As he let the tide break to cross the street it was
\par plain, from bright glances backward, that he had fluttered little hearts
\par which would smile upon him again. And so, in such a Romeo-like manner,
\par does this bulky sentimentalist, armed with concealed weapons, have
\par dalliance with the passing days. What you 'spose it is about him gives
\par him his fascination in flashing eyes haughty to the rest of the
\par masculine world--his bright buttons, or what?
\par 
\par Yes; these curious and romantic little relationships between traffic
\par cops on social duty, so to say, and their dainty admirers are not (in
\par some instances at least) so transient as to be merely the exchange of
\par roguish words and soft glances of the moment. There is that really
\par august being of matinee-idol figure at--well, let us say at Forty-second
\par Street. Sir Walter Raleigh could not with more courtliness pilot his
\par fair freight across the Avenue. So it was the day after Christmas I saw
\par not one but several of his young friends blushingly put dainty packages
\par into his hands.
\par 
\par Is there not an excellent O. Henry sort of story in this piquant city
\par situation?
\par 
\par Well, floating like a cork upon a river I drifted along up the Avenue. I
\par passed a man I had not seen for several years. Yes; that certainly was
\par the fellow I used to know. And yet he was an altogether different being
\par now, too. The sort of a shock I got has perhaps also been experienced by
\par you. Only a short time ago, it seemed to me, this friend of mine had
\par been robust and ruddy, masterful and gay, in the prime of his years. I
\par had somehow innocently expected him always to be so. Just as I find it
\par very unreal to think of myself in any other way than I am now. Don't
\par you? As to yourself, I mean. He was quite grey. His shoulders hung
\par forward. His chest seemed to have fallen in on itself. His legs moved
\par back and forth without ever altogether straightening out. He had a
\par whipped look. Wrinkled clothes and dusty black derby hat, he was
\par conspicuous in the peacockean scene. And yet on a time he had been, I
\par knew, as much a conqueror of hearts as any policeman. So would it
\par sometime be with me--like this?
\par 
\par What do you know about that! In the next block another acquaintance of
\par old I saw. But when I had known him he was stooped and little and thin
\par and dried up and cringing. He worked in a basement and did not wear a
\par collar, at least by day. He used to look very old. Now here he was
\par swinging along looking very much like Mr. Caruso, or some such personage
\par as that.
\par 
\par How may this phenomenon be accounted for, what was the misfortune of one
\par of these persons and the secret of the other? I know a man who has a
\par theory which, at least, sounds all right. It is not buttermilk nor
\par monkey glands, he contends, which will keep a man young and stalwart so
\par much as (what he calls) an objective in life--a distant rampart to take,
\par a golden fleece to pursue. That is why, he declares, scientists and
\par artists frequently live happy and alert to such a great age: Thomas A.
\par Edison, Leonardo Da Vinci and the Jap chap (what's his name? Hokusai)
\par who at a hundred and ten or thereabout was called "the old man mad about
\par painting."
\par 
\par Maybe it was thinking of that idea, maybe it was the fearsome thought of
\par that dusty derby hat of my friend's which haunted my mind, or maybe my
\par competitive instincts had been aroused from spring slumber by the
\par spectacle of my Caruso-like friend careering along, anyhow a decidedly
\par bugged-up feeling began to flow through me; I wavered in my loitering, I
\par turned, my sails (so to speak) caught the wind, and I laid my course
\par abruptly back to the office. I had suddenly a great itch to get at all
\par those letters.
\par 
\par I was very glad to see that fellow across the office from me. He is a
\par good fellow and very helpful. I said to him, "Look here, what do you
\par think about this idea for getting business?"
\par 
\par "Oh, my goodness!" he said; "it's altogether too fine a day to think
\par about work. I'd just like to go out and wander up the Avenue with
\par nothing on my mind but my hair."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXI
\par 
\par THREE WORDS ABOUT LITERATURE
\par 
\par 
\par A friend of mine (and aside from this error a very fine friend he is,
\par too) not long ago published a book which he declared, in his Preface,
\par should be read in bed. He insisted, to such an extent was he the victim
\par of a remarkable and pernicious fallacy which I find here and there, that
\par this book could not otherwise be properly enjoyed.
\par 
\par Now the difficulty about this particular book, that is the circumstance
\par wherein my friend has got me in a position where it is not so easy for
\par me to overturn him all at once, is this: one, not knowing any better,
\par might take the author's advice, and find pleasure reading the book in
\par bed, not being aware that this simply was because here was a book that
\par one would find pleasure in reading anywhere. But because you have got
\par hold of a book which it is possible to enjoy reading in the wrong way,
\par it naturally follows (does it not?) that you'd enjoy it much more
\par reading it in the right way. That, I should say, was simple and logical
\par enough.
\par 
\par I know, I know! I'm coming to that: there are plenty of other people who
\par have this ridiculous reading-in-bed idea. There, for instance, is
\par Richard Le Gallienne. I had a letter from him awhile ago, in which he
\par remarked that it was his practice to do most of his reading in bed. Then
\par I had a letter recently from Meredith Nicholson, in which there was some
\par such absurd phrase as "going to bed and reading until the cock crows."
\par Also I one time read an essay, a very pleasant essay outside the
\par mistaken notion of its main theme, by Michael Monahan, which was largely
\par about the pleasure of reading in bed. Spoke of the delights of being
\par tucked in, with what satisfaction you got the light just right, and all
\par that.
\par 
\par It must, of course, be acknowledged that all these gentlemen are, if
\par perverse in their method, persons of some reading. However, a fact such
\par as that, an accident as you might say, cannot be permitted to upset the
\par course of a profound argument. Why! as to that, a suspicion just occurs
\par to me that maybe someone could dig up Lamb, Hazlitt, Mark Twain,
\par Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Cowper (perhaps all of them, and more) to the
\par effect that it is pleasant to read in bed. Didn't Thackeray have some
\par nonsense about "bedside books"? _I_ haven't time to refute each of these
\par persons separately. It is sufficient, I take it, to roll into one point
\par of attack all this bed-reading heresy, from whatever quarters it comes,
\par and put an end to that.
\par 
\par Understand me; I have no complaint against the reading in bed of persons
\par confined there through physical disability. The world war which brought
\par more people to bed for indefinite periods than any other matter since
\par time began thereby probably got more souls into the way of reading than
\par seventeen times several hundred schools ever did. All of them, however,
\par would find that they were much better off in the matter of reading when
\par they had got out of bed. What I say is that, in a manner of speaking,
\par there is no use in taking the air in a wheel-chair if you can take it on
\par horseback. Why do a thing in a halfway fashion when you can go to it
\par right?
\par 
\par Another thing. There are people (I've seen them at it) who read on
\par porches. Sometimes in swings, rocking to and fro. Even in hammocks,
\par slung above the ground from trees. On trains, too. I have (with my own
\par ears) heard people say that they would "take a book" and go out into the
\par park, or into the woods, or out in a boat, or up on the mountain, or by
\par the sea, or any conceivable place except where one should go to read.
\par 
\par All of these ways of reading are worse, if anything can be worse than
\par that, than reading in bed. Because in bed you do, at least, have your
\par mind sandwiched within doors. You do not feel the surge and rumble of
\par the world--the sound and movement of the things of which literature is
\par made; but any contact with which (at the moment of reading) is
\par destructive to the illusion which it is the province of literature to
\par create.
\par 
\par For literature (reading it, I mean here) is, in this, like love: Richest
\par are the returns to that one whose passion is most complete in its
\par surrender. And a man lapping his frame in soft indolence, though he have
\par a book in his hand, is indulging in sensuous physical pleasure at least
\par equally with intellectual receptivity or aesthetic appreciation. No.
\par Reading should not be taken as an opiate.
\par 
\par The way to read, then--but, a moment more; a couple of other points are
\par to be cleared up. There is much babble of slippers and dressing-gowns,
\par easy chairs and "soft lights" in connection with the comments about the
\par pleasures, the "delights" as I believe some people say, of reading.
\par 
\par What is wanted to _know_ the relish to be got from reading is, first (of
\par course), an uncommon book. And by that term is meant merely one
\par uncommonly suited to the spirit of the reader. (The only perfect
\par definition, that, of a "good book.") Some people still read Stevenson.
\par Well, there's no great harm in that. Providing you read him (or anybody
\par else) as follows:
\par 
\par You should read as you should die--with your boots on. You take a wooden
\par chair, without arms, such (this is the best) as is commonly called a
\par "kitchen chair." It has a good, hard seat. You sit upright in this,
\par crossing and recrossing your legs as they tire. Nearby you is a good,
\par strong light, one with a tonic effect, a light that keeps your eyes wide
\par open. You sit facing a dull, blank wall. No pictures or other ornaments
\par or decorations should be on this wall, as, in case such things are
\par there, and you happen to raise your eyes for an instant, in ecstasy or
\par in thought, your vision lights upon one of these things; and the heart
\par which you have given your author is, certainly in some measure,
\par alienated from him. Maybe, indeed, you go back to him almost at once.
\par But then harm has been done--you have not read with supreme abandon.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXII
\par 
\par RECOLLECTIONS OF LANDLADIES
\par 
\par 
\par There is no figure in the human scene which makes so unctuous an appeal
\par to our relish of humanity as the landlady. When the landlady comes upon
\par the stage at the theatre, we all awaken to an expectation of delight in
\par the characteristic manifestations of her nature, and seldom are
\par disappointed. The genius of the greatest of authors always unfolds with
\par particular warmth in the presence of their landladies. A moment's
\par reflection will recall a procession of immortal landladies. Whether it
\par is that the colorful calling of landlady cultivates in one a peculiar
\par richness of human nature, or whether landladies are born and not
\par made--those with characters of especial tang and savor instinctively
\par adopting this occupation,--I cannot say, but the fact is indisputable
\par that landladies are not as other persons are. No one ever saw a humdrum
\par landlady. A commonplace person as a landlady is unthinkable.
\par 
\par Now I think I may say that all my life, or nearly all, I have been an
\par eager and earnest student of landladies. I am, indeed, much more
\par familiar with the genus landlady than with courts and kings, or with
\par eminent personages generally such as supply the material for most of
\par those who write their recollections. Thus I am competent, I think, to
\par speak on a subject curiously neglected by the memorist.
\par 
\par One who makes a culture of landladies comes in time to have a flair for
\par these racy beings, and is drawn by a happy intuition to the habitats of
\par those most resplendent in the qualities of their kind. Of course, one
\par never can tell what life will bring forth, but it seems to me that my
\par present landlady marks the top of my career as a connoisseur, an
\par amateur, of landladies. She is strikingly reminiscent of an English
\par landlady. And England, particularly London, is, as all the world knows,
\par to the devotee of landladies what Africa is to the big game
\par sportsman--his paradise. There the species comes to luxuriant flower, so
\par that to possess with the mind one or two well-developed London
\par landladies is never to be without food for entertainment. My present
\par landlady, to return, is of course a widow. While it may be, for aught I
\par know, that all widows are not landladies, with very few exceptions all
\par landladies worthy of the name are widows. Those who are not widows
\par outright are, as you might say, widows in a sense. That is, while their
\par husbands may accurately be spoken of as living, and indeed are visible,
\par they do not exist in the normal r\'f4le of husband. The commercial impulses
\par of the bona-fide husband have died in them, generally through their
\par attachment to alcoholic liquor, and they become satellites, hewers of
\par wood and drawers of water, to the genius awakened by circumstances in
\par their wives.
\par 
\par I one time had a landlady of this origin in Norwalk, Connecticut. She
\par was a woman of angular frame, with a face of flint, a tongue of vinegar,
\par and a heart of gold. This, I have found in my travels, is the type of
\par the semi-widowed landlady. I had another such an identical one in
\par Topeka, Kansas. The asperity, doubtless, is occasioned by biting
\par disillusionment in the romance of long ago, but it is external; frost on
\par the window; at the heart's core wells the sense of universe-embracing
\par maternity which makes the character of the landlady by vocation
\par sublime. All semi-widowed landladies have (it is their divine
\par inspiration) large families of half-grown sons. My landlady of Norwalk
\par grumbled continually; she could be heard out in the kitchen complaining
\par in a shrill, querulous tone that, with things as high as they were,
\par people would be crazy to expect meat twice a day. Yet she had at her
\par board the meanest, most low-down, ornery, contemptible, despicable cuss
\par in human form I ever knew, and the only fault I ever heard her find with
\par him was that he didn't eat enough.
\par 
\par The erudite in landladies have, of course, cognizance of a class which
\par are in no degree widows. Those of this department of the race, however,
\par frequently are not landladies in fibre, but merely incidentally. They
\par are young wives who for a transient period seek to help out in the
\par domestic economy by taking a few lodgers who come with unexceptionable
\par references. As wives doubtless they are meritorious; but no monument
\par need be erected to them as landladies. Though I should like to see in
\par the principal public square of every town and city a monument designed
\par by an artist of ability placed to the enduring glory of the landladies
\par of that place. For are not landladies ancient institutions fostering
\par the public weal, and in their field not a whit less deserving of homage
\par than governors and soldiers? I would say to a nation, show me your
\par landladies and I will tell you your destiny. I should be remiss,
\par however, in my chronicle did I not note that among these partial and
\par ephemeral landladies occasionally are to be found pronounced landlady
\par potentialities. I recall a landlady I had on Montague Street, Brooklyn
\par Heights, whose passion for cleaning amounted to a mania. This young
\par person's housewifery frenzy always put me in mind of another soul who
\par could not rest--Hokusai, who at about a hundred and ten was spoken of as
\par "the old man mad about painting."
\par 
\par Hovering about, tortured by a desire to begin, when I left for my
\par breakfast, she was still at it upon my return from my morning stroll, my
\par door barricaded by articles of dismembered furniture; still at it when I
\par came back a bit impatiently from a second walk; still at it while I read
\par the paper in her dining-room. And so without surcease throughout the
\par march of days and seasons. She unscrewed the knobs of the bed to polish
\par the threads thereof; she removed penpoints from penholders and made them
\par to shine like burnished gold. I had another landlady moved by the same
\par springs of feeling, on Spruce Street, Philadelphia. Later, I heard, her
\par husband died, and she espoused her latent career.
\par 
\par There is in the galaxy of landladies quite another type, an exotic plant
\par in the wondrously competent sisterhood, specimens of which may be found
\par blooming here and there like some rare orchid. I mean the fragile, lady
\par landlady, the clinging vine bereft of the supporting husband oak. Such
\par was Mrs. Knoll, of Central Avenue, Indianapolis, a little, plump,
\par rounded body, exceedingly bright, pleasant, intelligent, amiable, and
\par helpless; all of which qualities shone from her very agreeable face and
\par person. In her youth no doubt she was a type of beauty, and she remained
\par very well preserved. "Life and vanity and disappointment had slipped
\par away" (in the Thackerian words) from Dr. Knoll some years before; and
\par his widow and only child, Miss Knoll, were left in possession of the old
\par family home, and nothing more. They could not bear to leave it, that
\par would "break their hearts," said good, ineffectual Mrs. Knoll; so it was
\par viewed by them, unfortunately somewhat fallaciously, in the light of a
\par possible support.
\par 
\par The Doctor evidently was a man of books, and his widow had sought, more
\par and more, companionship in reading. Life--the actual world about her,
\par that is--, and vanity, but not disappointment, had, in a manner of
\par speaking, slipped from her, too. And she had turned to that great world
\par of shadows. "In books," she said, "I can choose my own company." She had
\par plighted her troth in youth to Dickens and to Thackeray, and to these
\par she had remained ever faithful. In a world of false books and unsafe
\par friends she knew that she had by the hand two true spirits. Jane Austen
\par she loaned me with tremulous pleasure. And she was very fond of Mr.
\par Howells, with whom, she said she lived a great deal; and the Kentons,
\par the Laphams, and the Marches, were characters better known to her "than
\par her next-door neighbors." But it must be confessed that the tender
\par perfume of Mrs. Knoll was not altogether an equivalent in the sphere of
\par her passive efforts to the homely vegetable odor of the authentic
\par landlady.
\par 
\par In great cities, amid the sheen of civilization is to be found just
\par adjacent to smart quarters of the town the tulip in the variegated
\par garden of landladies--the finished, polished stone gathered from the
\par mine, the bird of plumage of the species; I mean, of course, the
\par landlady _du beau monde_, the modish landlady, or perhaps I should say,
\par the professional hostess, as it were. For it seems rather vulgar, a
\par thing repellent to the finer sensibilities, to touch this distinguished
\par figure of immaculate artificiality with the plebeian term of "landlady."
\par The personages of this type are, so to say, of the peerage of their
\par order. Such a Lady Drew it was whose guest I became for a time on
\par Madison Avenue, New York. With silvered hair like a powdered coiffure;
\par softly tinted with the delicate enamel of cosmetic; rich and stately of
\par corsage--this expensive and highly sophisticated presence presided, in
\par the subdued tone of the best society, over the nicely adjusted machinery
\par of her smart establishment by the authority of a consciousness of highly
\par cultivated efficiency and an aroma of unexceptionable standards.
\par 
\par This consummate hostess type of landlady is, of course, one which the
\par passionate collector will preserve in the cabinet of his mind with
\par tremulous happiness in the sheer preciosity of it. I cannot but feel,
\par however, myself, that this type fails of complete perfection as a work
\par of art in this: that in every work of the first genius, it cannot be
\par denied, there is always a strain of coarseness. And perhaps I should
\par confess that my own taste in landladies, though I hope it is not
\par undiscriminating, leans a bit toward the popular taste, the relish of
\par the Rabelaisian.
\par 
\par Stevenson has observed that most men of high destinies have even
\par high-sounding names. And anyone who has reflected at all upon the
\par phenomenon of landladies must have been struck by the singularly
\par idiosyncratic character of their names. Indeed, an infallible way to
\par pick out a competent landlady from an advertisement is by her name. Is
\par it a happy name for a landlady? Go there! As her name is, so is her
\par nature. I one time had a landlady on Broome Street, New York, whom the
\par gods named Mrs. Brew. I one time had a landlady (in Milligan Place,
\par Manhattan) of the name of Mrs. Boggs. One time I had a landlady just off
\par the East India Dock Road, London, whose name was Wigger. I shall always
\par cherish the memory of the landlady I had down in Surrey, Mrs. Cheeseman.
\par One and all, these ladies, as landladies, were without stain.
\par 
\par Regarded as a bibelot, Mrs. Wigger was, I think, of the first
\par perfection. In her own genre, so to say, she was as finished, as
\par impossible of improvement, as an Elgin marble, a Grecian urn, a bit of
\par Chinese blue and white, a fan of old Japan, a Vermeer, a Whistler
\par symphony, a caricature by Max Beerbohm. She was of massive mould and
\par very individually shapen. Her face was very large and very red and
\par heavily pock-marked. In her bizarre garments, in some indefinable way
\par she imparted to the character of the born slattern something of the
\par Grand Style. Her utterance was quavered in a weird, cracked voice, which
\par had somewhat an effect as of the wind crying high aloft in a ship's
\par rigging. She slipslod about, always a bit unsteadily. Her movements and
\par her manner generally, I felt, made it not unreasonable to suppose that
\par she had in secret certain habits no longer widely approved by society.
\par The apple of her eye was an unkempt parrot which spent its days in
\par vainly attempting to ascend the embracing sides of a tin bathtub.
\par 
\par Landladies, beyond all other persons, have the esoteric power of
\par becoming for one the geniuses of places. It would, for instance, be
\par quite impossible for anyone to visualize my Mrs. Cheeseman torn from, as
\par you might say her context. If you were asked to describe Mrs. Cheeseman
\par you would naturally do it in this way: You would say, "Well, I wonder
\par what has become of the sweetest, quaintest, fairest old inn in all
\par England!" And into your mind would come a rapid cinematograph picture:
\par 
\par A highway winding out of Dorking, stretching its way between hills to
\par the sea. You round a turn and see before you long, low, glistening white
\par stables--the stables, evidently, of a coaching inn. And presently you
\par come into view of an ancient, white, stone building with a "Sussex
\par roof." From a tall post before the door swings the board of the "King's
\par Head." White ducks ride in a pond at the roadside there. Round this inn
\par which you are approaching is the greenest, handsomest hedge ever seen.
\par And along the road beyond you perceive the cottages of a wee village.
\par 
\par "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God."
\par The romance of destiny which in its inscrutable way has been leading you
\par all your long life long to the bosom, if I may so put it, of Mrs.
\par Cheeseman, reveals its beneficence now by carefully graduated steps. At
\par the other side of the main bulk of the "King's Head," which it was given
\par you first to see, you come upon a delicious little flagged yard leading
\par to another arm of the house, older still, very venerable, with a high
\par roof low descending, a roof which tucks under its projecting wing many
\par oddly placed little latticed windows gayly sporting innumerable tiny
\par panes. Like a miniature cathedral spire, a tall, quaint chimney stands
\par sentinel at one corner, and several chimney-pots peep over the roof's
\par dark crown.
\par 
\par Up this little yard, bounded on one side by a multicolored flower garden
\par whose fragrance bathes you in a softening vapor of perfume, you enter,
\par by a door which requires you to stoop, the wee taproom. Here: a
\par cavernous fireplace, settles are within against its sides, a gigantic
\par blackened crane swung across its middle, and a cubby-hole of a window at
\par its back. Above it is swung an ancient fowling-piece. The stone floor of
\par the room, like the ancient flags without, is worn into dips and hollows.
\par Along the window-sill of an oblong window measuring one wall is a bright
\par parade of potted plants.
\par 
\par It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is something psychic
\par about landladies. As you look about you at the environment in which you
\par find yourself, you experience a premonition that you are nearing an
\par affinity in the landlady world. It is strange, too, that there are
\par places where you have never been before (in the life which you
\par consciously remember) that give you at once completely the feeling of
\par your having arrived at the home familiar to your spirit. And there
\par presently occurs here an event in your career predetermined (I doubt
\par not) \'e6ons and \'e6ons ago. A buxom body with the most glorious complexion
\par (you ween) in all England--which is to say in the world--enters the
\par ancient room: a lass whose rosy, honest, pedestrian face and bursting
\par figure are to become forever more for you the connotation of the name
\par "Maggie." The daughter, this, (you later learn) of your Mrs. Cheeseman.
\par 
\par Soon it is all arranged, and you are having your tea--a "meat tea"--in
\par the sitting-room of the "King's Head," your sitting-room now. A bucolic
\par slavey--a person whose cheerful simpleness is like to that of the little
\par creatures of the field--attends you. In this commodious apartment of
\par yours is a great scintillation of chintz; flowers, in pots and vases,
\par everywhere caress the eye; and the fancy is kindled by the spectacle of
\par many stuffed birds in glass cases. On the heavily flowered wall hangs a
\par handsome specimen of the "glass" (invariably found in England) for
\par forecasting the weather; a "pianoforte," as piquantly old-fashioned as a
\par cocked hat, crosses one end wall; and venerable paintings (which time
\par has mellowed to the richness and the general color effect of an old plug
\par of tobacco), bright sporting prints, and antique oddities of furniture
\par to an extent that it would require a catalogue to name, all combine to
\par give an air of true sitting-room opulence to the chamber.
\par 
\par But of landladies, and the connotations of landladies, one could write a
\par book of several volumes; and it being a very fair day, and a Sunday, and
\par the first cool breath after a very hot summer, I do not think I shall
\par write those volumes this afternoon; I shall go out for a bit of air and
\par a look at the world.
\par

\par 
\par CHAPTER XXIII
\par 
\par AN IDIOSYNCRASY
\par 
\par 
\par Then there's the matter of these dedications. Several weeks ago I
\par received a communication. I think it was sent by Miss Katherine Lord, or
\par maybe it was Hamlin Garland. Anyhow, it was an invitation. The upshot of
\par this invitation was that the annual exhibit of the "best books of the
\par year" held at the National Arts Club, New York City, under the auspices
\par of the Joint Committee of Literary Arts was now going--or was just about
\par to go. Further, it was conveyed that the opening evening of the exhibit
\par would be devoted to a reception for the authors of the books exhibited.
\par Also, that on this evening speeches would be made by a number of
\par distinguished persons acquainted with this matter on the subject of the
\par idiosyncrasies of authors and editors. Further than this, this
\par invitation made clear beyond all manner of reasonable doubt that the
\par pleasure of the evening would be generally felt to be sadly incomplete
\par without the presence there among the speakers of myself.
\par 
\par The reasons why I was (I am sorry to say) unable to rise to this
\par occasion were two. For one thing, I have known long and intimately a
\par considerable number of authors and editors. Also, I have had the honor
\par of having been several times to the National Arts Club. And (such is my
\par tact and delicacy) I could not feel that this was any fit place for me
\par to discuss the (as the term is) idiosyncrasies with which a decidedly
\par checkered career has acquainted me. Then, as to one of my own
\par idiosyncrasies: I am like George Moore in this which he says, that he is
\par "the only Irishman living or dead who cannot make a speech"--except that
\par I am not an Irishman.
\par 
\par All of this, however, is merely picking up the threads of my thought.
\par What I have in my eye is an idiosyncrasy of authors which doubtless I
\par could have discussed with some propriety. That is, if I were able to
\par discuss before an audience anything at all. Though with this subject, as
\par many of those present were authors (who had their toes along with them)
\par I should have had to exercise more than a little caution, and
\par considerable skill in maintaining a honeyed amiability. Maybe this
\par theme wouldn't have done at all either.
\par 
\par You see, it's this way: Many people, I believe, do not read the
\par introductions, prefaces, forewords (and whatever else such things are
\par called) to books. I always do. Perhaps this is a habit formed during a
\par number of years spent as a professional reviewer. If you read the
\par introduction, preface (or whatever it's called), to a book you can
\par generally pick up pretty much what the author thought he was about when
\par he wrote it, the points he intended to make in the work, the
\par circumstances in which he wrote it, and so on. This is a great time and
\par labor saving procedure. All you've got to do then is to read a bit in
\par the volume here and there to taste the style, pick up a few errors of
\par fact or grammar, glance at the "conclusion," where the author sums up,
\par to see whether or not he got anywhere--and so far as you are further put
\par out by having this book on your hands it might just as well never have
\par been written. But I am drifting. That's one reason I can't make a
\par speech. Never can recollect what it was I set out to say.
\par 
\par Oh, yes! About these dedications. Less people than read prefaces, I
\par fancy, read the dedications of books. I always read 'em. I read them
\par when I have no intention whatever of reading the volumes which
\par they--well, dedicate. They are fine--dedications. Better, far better,
\par than old tombstones. But never judge a book by its dedication.
\par 
\par I one time knew a man, of a most decidedly humorous cast of mind, who
\par was a great spendthrift, an A 1 wastrel. He ran through everything his
\par father left him (a very fair little fortune), and then when he had run
\par through, in advance of that gentleman's death, everything his wife was
\par to inherit from his father-in-law he had no means whatever. He had a
\par daughter. Without, it was clearly evident, the least suspicion of the
\par pleasant humor of this, he named her Hope. She was a small child.
\par And--it's absurd, I know; but 'tis so; there was not a particle of
\par conscious irony in it; this child's name was the one blind spot in her
\par father's sense of the ridiculous--her parents frequently referred to her
\par affectionately as "little Hope."
\par 
\par So, quite so, with dedications. Whenever, or perhaps we had better say
\par frequently, when a man writes a particularly worthless book he lays the
\par deed (in his dedication of it) onto his wife, "without whose constant
\par devotion," etc., etc., etc., "this work would never have come into
\par being." Amen! Or he says that it is inscribed "To--my gentlest
\par friend--and severest critic--my aged Grandmother." Or maybe he accuses
\par his little daughter, "whose tiny hands have led me." Again he may say
\par benignantly: "To--my faithful friend--Murray Hill--who made possible
\par this volume"; or "the illumination of whose personality has lighted my
\par way to truth."
\par 
\par Doubtless he means well, this author. And, in most cases, highly
\par probable it is that his magnanimous sentiments are O. K. all round. For
\par to the minds of what would probably be called "right-thinking" persons
\par is not having a book dedicated to you the equivalent, almost, of having
\par a career yourself? I know a very distinguished American novelist--well,
\par I'll tell you who he is: Booth Tarkington--who has told me this: Time
\par and again he has been relentlessly pursued by some person unknown to him
\par who, in the belief that did he once hear it he would surely use it as
\par material for his next book, wished to tell him the story of his life.
\par This life, according to the communications received by the novelist,
\par was in every case one of the most remarkable ever lived by man. It was,
\par in every case, most extraordinary in, among a variety of other singular
\par things, this: the abounding in it of the most amazing coincidences. And
\par so on, and so on, and so on. One of these romantic personages nailed the
\par novelist somewhere coming out of a doorway one day, and contrived to
\par compel him to sit down and listen to the life story. He was an old, old
\par man, this chap, and firmly convinced that the tale of his many days (as
\par simple, commonplace, dull and monotonous an existence as ever was
\par conceived) was unique. Now he did not want any pay for telling his
\par story; he had no design on any royalty to come from the great book to be
\par made out of it; no, not at all. All he asked--and that, he thought, was
\par fair enough--was that the book be dedicated to him. And so it was with
\par them all, all of those with the remarkable, obscure, romantic, humdrum
\par lives. So much for that.
\par 
\par Dedications run the whole gamut of the emotions. A type of author very
\par tonic to the spirit is that one whose soul embraces not merely an
\par individual but which enfolds in its heroic sweep a nation, a people, or
\par some mighty idea. What, for instance, could be more vast in the
\par grandeur of its sweep than this--which I came upon the other day in a
\par modest little volume? "To the Children of Destiny." The Great War, which
\par has wrought so much evil and inspired so much literature, is responsible
\par for a flood of noble, lofty dedications. The merest snooping through a
\par bunch of recent war books turns up, among a multitude more, the
\par following: "To the Mothers of America." "To--the Loyalty and
\par Patriotism--of the--American People." "To the Hour--When the Troops Turn
\par Home." "To All the Men at the Front."
\par 
\par I should not affirm, of course, that there is anything new under the
\par sun. And it is very probable that ever since this psychic literature
\par began (whenever it began) authors resident beyond the stars have,
\par naturally enough, dedicated their manuscripts submitted to earthly
\par publishers to folks back in the old home, so to say. But with the War,
\par which has so greatly stimulated literary activity on the other side of
\par life, the dedications of these (to put it so) expatriated authors have
\par perhaps become (in a manner of speaking) loftier in tone than ever
\par before. As a sample of the present state of exalted feeling of authors
\par of this sort I copy the following dedication from the recently published
\par book of a writer "gone West": "To the heroic women of the world, the
\par mothers, wives and sweethearts who bravely sent us forth to battle for a
\par great cause:--we who have crossed the Great Divide salute you."
\par 
\par I wish, I do wish, I had at hand a book which I saw a number of years
\par ago.... As examples of persons to whom books have been dedicated may be
\par specified The Deity, The Virgin Mary, Royalty and Dignitaries of Church
\par and State, "The Reader," and the author himself. Many of the pleasantest
\par dedications have been to children. Besides armies and navies, countries,
\par states, cities and their inhabitants, books have also been dedicated to
\par institutions and societies, to animals, to things spiritual, and to
\par things inanimate. An attractive example of a dedication to Deity is
\par furnished by one John Leycaeter, who, in 1649, dedicated his "Civill
\par Warres of England, Briefly Related from his Majesties First Setting Up
\par his Standard, 1641, to this Present Personall Hopefull Treaty"--"To the
\par Honour and Glory of the Infinite, Immense, and Incomprehensible Majesty
\par of Jehovah, the Fountaine of all Excellencies, the Lord of Hosts, the
\par Giver of all Victories, and the God of Peace." He continued in a poem,
\par "By J. O. Ley, a small crumme of mortality."
\par 
\par But about that book I saw some time ago. You, of course, remember that
\par prayer in "Tom Sawyer" (or somewhere else in Mark Twain) where the
\par great-hearted minister called upon the Lord to bless the President of
\par the United States, the President's Cabinet, the Senate of the United
\par States, the governors of each of the states, and their legislatures, the
\par mayors of all the cities, and all the towns, of the United States, and
\par the inhabitants--grandmothers and grandfathers, mothers and wives,
\par husbands and fathers, sons and daughters, bachelors and little
\par children--of every hamlet, town and city of the United States, also of
\par all the countryside thereof. Well, this book of which I am
\par speaking,--this minister in the august range and compass of his prayer
\par had nothing on its dedication. It was published, as I recollect, by the
\par author; printed on very woody wood-pulp paper by a job press, and had a
\par coarse screen frontispiece portrait of the author, whose name has long
\par since left me. What it was about I do not remember. That is a little
\par matter. It lives in my mind, and should live in the memory of the
\par world, by its dedication; which, I recall, in part was: "To the Sultan
\par of Turkey--the Emperor of Japan--the Czar of Russia--the Emperor of
\par Germany--the President of France--the King of England--the President of
\par the United States--and to God."
\par 
\par But it was in an elder day that they really knew how to write sonorous
\par dedications. If I should write a book (and the idea of having one to
\par dedicate tempts me greatly) I'd pick out some important personage, such
\par as Benjamin De Casseres, or Frank Crowinshield, or Charles Hanson Towne,
\par or somebody like that. Then I would take as the model for my dedication
\par that one, say, of Boswell's to Sir Joshua Reynolds. I am afraid you have
\par not read it lately. And so, for the joy the meeting of it again will
\par give you, I will copy it out. It goes as follows:
\par 
\par      My Dear Sir,--Every liberal motive that can actuate an Authour in
\par      the dedication of his labours, concurs in directing me to you, as
\par      the person to whom the following Work should be inscribed.
\par 
\par      If there be a pleasure in celebrating the distinguished merit of a
\par      contemporary, mixed with a certain degree of vanity not altogether
\par      inexcusable, in appearing fully sensible of it, where can I find
\par      one, in complimenting whom I can with more general approbation
\par      gratify those feelings? Your excellence not only in the Art over
\par      which you have long presided with unrivalled fame, but also in
\par      Philosophy and elegant Literature, is well known to the present,
\par      and will continue to be the admiration of future ages. Your equal
\par      and placid temper, your variety of conversation, your true
\par      politeness, by which you are so amiable in private society, and
\par      that enlarged hospitality which has long made your house a common
\par      centre of union for the great and accomplished, the learned, and
\par      the ingenious; all these qualities I can, in perfect confidence of
\par      not being accused of flattery, ascribe to you.
\par 
\par      If a man may indulge an honest pride, in having it known to the
\par      world, that he has been thought worthy of particular attention by a
\par      person of the first eminence in the age in which he lived, whose
\par      company has been universally courted, I am justified in availing
\par      myself of the usual privilege of a Dedication, when I mention that
\par      there has been a long and uninterrupted friendship between us.
\par 
\par      If gratitude should be acknowledged for favours received, I have
\par      this opportunity, my dear Sir, most sincerely to thank you for the
\par      many happy hours which I owe to your kindness,--for the cordiality
\par      with which you have at all times been pleased to welcome me,--for
\par      the number of valuable acquaintances to whom you have introduced
\par      me,--for the _noctes c\'e6n\'e6que De\'fbm_, which I have enjoyed under your
\par      roof.
\par 
\par      If a work should be inscribed to one who is master of the subject
\par      of it, and whose approbation, therefore, must ensure it credit and
\par      success, the Life of Dr. Johnson is, with the greatest propriety,
\par      dedicated to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was the intimate and beloved
\par      friend of that great man; the friend, whom he declared to be "the
\par      most invulnerable man he knew; whom, if he should quarrel with him,
\par      he should find the most difficulty how to abuse." You, my dear Sir,
\par      studied him, and knew him well: you venerated and admired him. Yet,
\par      luminous as he was upon the whole, you perceived all the shades
\par      which mingled in the grand composition; all the peculiarities and
\par      slight blemishes which marked the literary Colossus. Your very warm
\par      commendation of the specimen which I gave in my "Journal of a Tour
\par      to the Hebrides," of my being able to preserve his conversation in
\par      an authentik and lively manner, which opinion the Publik has
\par      confirmed, was the best encouragement for me to persevere in my
\par      purpose of producing the whole of my stores....
\par 
\par        I am, my dear Sir,
\par           Your much obliged friend,
\par                And faithful humble servant,
\par     London, April 20, 1791.
\par                           JAMES BOSWELL.
\par 
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par In a more modern style of composition the epistolary form of dedication
\par is still employed. I wish I had not (one time when I was moving) lost
\par that copy I had, English edition, of George Moore's book "The Lake." I
\par have a feeling that the dedicatory letter there, in French, was an
\par admirable example of its kind of thing. If you happen to have a copy of
\par the book, why don't you look it up?
\par 
\par When poems are written as dedications an established convention is
\par followed. You affect at the beginning (in this formula) to be very
\par humble in spirit, deeply modest in your conception of your powers. You
\par speak, if your book is verse, of your "fragile rhyme," or (with Patmore)
\par you "drag a rumbling wain." Again perhaps you speak (in the words of
\par Burns) of your "wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble," or you call
\par Southwell to witness that:
\par 
\par     He that high growth on cedars did bestow,
\par     Gave also lowly mushrumps leave to grow.
\par 
\par And so on. At any rate, you always do this. Then you say that his (or
\par her) eyes for whom the book was written will change the dross to gold,
\par the "blind words" to "authentic song," the "mushrump" to a flower, or
\par some such thing. So, after all, you skillfully contrive to leave your
\par book to the reader on a rather high, confident note. Any other way of
\par writing a dedicatory poem to a book of verse (being out of the tradition
\par altogether) is, I take it, bad, very bad, literary etiquette.
\par 
\par Numerous dedications have considerable fame. There is that enigmatical
\par one to "Mr. W. H.," prefixed by Thomas Thorpe, bookseller of London, to
\par Shakespeare's Sonnets. And Dr. Johnson's scathing definition of a patron
\par when Lord Chesterfield fell short of Johnson's expectations in the
\par amount which he contributed to the publication of the famous dictionary
\par men will not willingly let die. Another celebrated dedication is that of
\par "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies"--"To the Rare Few, who, early in
\par life, have rid themselves of the Friendship of the Many." Laurence
\par Sterne's solemn "putting up fairly to public sale" to an imaginary lord
\par a dedication to "Tristram Shandy" is not without merit. John Burroughs
\par was felicitous in his dedication of "Bird and Bough"--"To the kinglet
\par that sang in my evergreens in October and made me think it was May." And
\par a very amiable dedication prefixed to "The Bashful Earthquake," by
\par Oliver Herford, illustrated by the author, is this: "To the Illustrator,
\par in grateful acknowledgment of his amiable condescension in lending his
\par exquisite and delicate art to the embellishment of these poor verses,
\par from his sincerest admirer, The Author." Mr. Herford's latest book (at
\par the time of this writing), "This Giddy Globe," is dedicated so: "To
\par President Wilson (With all his faults he quotes me still)."
\par 
\par A clever dedication, I think, is that of Christopher Morley's
\par "Shandygaff"--"To The Miehle Printing Press--More Sinned Against Than
\par Sinning." A dedication intended to be clever, and one frequently seen,
\par is, in effect, "To the Hesitating Purchaser." A certain appropriateness
\par is presented in a recent book on advertising, "Respectfully dedicated to
\par the men who invest millions of dollars a year in national advertising."
\par And some nimbleness of wit is attained in the inscription of the book
\par "Why Worry"--"To my long-suffering family and circle of friends, whose
\par patience has been tried by my efforts to eliminate worry, this book is
\par affectionately dedicated." As cheerful a dedication as I have come
\par across is that prefixed by Francis Hackett to his volume "The Invisible
\par Censor"; it is: "To My Wife--Signe Toksvig--whose lack of interest--in
\par this book has been my--constant desperation."
\par 
\par Miss Annie Carroll Moore, supervisor of work with children at the New
\par York Public Library, tells me that the other day a small boy inquired,
\par "Who was the first man to write a book to another man?" I'm sure I don't
\par know. Perhaps this is told somewhere. A number of books and articles
\par concerning dedications, I have heard, are to be found in studious
\par places. I have never read any of them. I remember, however, reviewing
\par for a newspaper a number of years ago (I think it was in 1913) a book,
\par then just published, called "Dedications: An Anthology of the Forms Used
\par from the Earliest Days of Bookmaking to the Present Time." It was
\par compiled by Mary Elizabeth Brown. The volume made handy to the general
\par reader a fairly representative collection of dedications.

\par CHAPTER XXIV
\par 
\par THE SEXLESS CAMERA
\par 
\par 
\par There is no nicer point, perhaps, in the study of photography as the one
\par true, detached observer of mankind than here: It sees, what man has not
\par seen--as his own representations show, his paintings, his drawings, his
\par sculptures--the feminine underpinning with a quite passive, sexless eye.
\par 
\par In this interesting matter there are two human conceptions. There is the
\par chorus girl style of leg, the expression of piquancy, which does not
\par perhaps appeal to the noblest emotions, but the fascination of which has
\par always haunted man whenever he has delineated anything in a stocking.
\par Then there is the chaste, nude feminine limb of the painter and the
\par sculptor. Both photography shows to be idealization.
\par 
\par When the camera reproduces the chorus girl herself, suddenly strangely
\par plain and painted, there is to the observing and reflective instead of
\par sauciness the hollowness of sauciness. There can be few things more
\par awful than those silent photographs of some gay chorus, reproducing, as
\par they do, the spectacle with solemn critical aloofness from the spirit.
\par It is as though the dawn of Judgment Day had suddenly broken upon the
\par unspeakably wretched and tawdry scene. There is something, it would
\par seem, indescribably tender, affectionate, in the irony of the gods which
\par arranges that men should display in theatre lobbies, as an inducement to
\par buy tickets of admission within, these death's heads of frivolity. As if
\par the Comic Spirit itself were touched by the charm of the naivet\'e9 of man.
\par 
\par But, indeed, twinkling in the sympathetic light upon the Broadway stage,
\par the professional chorus girl leg, well selected no doubt to begin with,
\par and shaped with all the science of art, has beguiled even the
\par reflective. A light intoxicant, it swirls in the veins like champagne
\par for the careless moment it makes. It is pleasant because it is false.
\par 
\par The real leg, remarks the camera, is the amateur leg; it is depressing,
\par but terribly convincing. As it stands in the raw light of the cheap
\par photographer (and this too, too human document, the likeness of the
\par poor girl who has performed somewhere in curiously home-made looking
\par "tights," and been photographed thus afterward, is one of the stock
\par exhibits of that most realistic of historians, the cheap photographer)
\par the amateur leg decidedly lacks dash. The knee joint somehow seems to
\par work somewhat the wrong way. Sometimes, in circumference, this limb is
\par immense, sometimes the reverse. But the terribleness of it always is
\par that it is so human. That is, it is the leg of an animal. Subconsciously
\par it suggests surgery.
\par 
\par Conspicuous among the postures assumed for its iconoclastic purpose by
\par the genius of photography is that of "art." That fetish of the great
\par body of the unenlightened, the dim feeling that to the enlightened
\par bodily nakedness in pictorial representation is something very fine, is
\par played upon. The "art photograph" is an ironic tour de force. If
\par specimens of this have ever fallen in the way of your observation, then
\par you have reflected upon the strange discrepancy between the female nude
\par as presented in painting and sculpture and in photographs. (Oh, souls of
\par Fragonard, Boucher, Watteau, what romantic rogues you were!) You will
\par have perceived, with some grim humor, that until the invention of
\par photography, nobody, apparently, had ever seen a nude female figure.
\par 
\par Now there is Edgar Degas,--and it is a curious reflection that in
\par comparison with the work of this pessimist genius who has deliberately
\par brought cynicism to bear upon the female nude, photographs purporting
\par (over their sneer) to be reflections of beauty, give by far the most
\par distressing impression. In the painful realization that they have a kind
\par of truth beyond human art these abominable humbugs are a kind of art.
\par What (you exclaimed) was Schopenhauer's remark about the clouded
\par intellect of _man_ which could give the name of the "fair sex" to "that
\par under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, knock-kneed race"?
\par 
\par It may be a long "drive," but it strikes you as a thoughtful observer
\par that there is some biological analogy between "art photographs" and the
\par photographs, to be seen in travel books, of native African women. What a
\par philosopher the camera is! The French savant was very probably
\par contemplating the photograph of some member of a savage tribe when he
\par wrote, in "The Garden of Epicurus" (addressing modern ladies): "But
\par never think too highly of yourselves, my sisters; you were not, at your
\par first appearance in the world, perfect and fully armed. Your
\par grandmothers in the days of the mammoth and the giant bear did not wield
\par the same dominion over the prehistoric hunters and cave-men which you
\par possess over us. You were useful then, and necessary, but you were not
\par invincible. To tell the truth, in those far-off ages, and for long
\par afterwards, you lacked charm. In those days you were like men, and men
\par were like brutes. To make of you the fearful and wonderful thing you are
\par today--veils: the Empire, crinoline, d\'e9collet\'e9, tube, pannier." And, the
\par sexless camera explains, the poetry of man.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXV
\par 
\par I KNOW AN EDITOR
\par 
\par 
\par I know a young woman--a very handsome young woman she is, too. (I have a
\par decided penchant for handsome young women.) But that is beside the
\par point. As I was about to say (when a pleasant but an extraneous idea
\par interrupted me): this young woman the other day took her young husband
\par by the hand and conducted him to the offices of a publisher. Here she
\par mounted him upon a chair (very much, I fancy, as though the child were
\par about to have his hair cut), and she said to the barber--I mean she said
\par to the editor, with whom she had some acquaintance--she said: "This is
\par my husband. He is just out of the army. I have brought him in to have
\par his head shingled"---- No, no! that isn't what she said; I am getting my
\par wires crossed. She said, "I have brought him in to get him a position
\par here."
\par 
\par Said the editor, "What would your son, I mean your husband, like to
\par do?"
\par 
\par "I want him," replied the young woman, "to be an editor."
\par 
\par "Has he ever been an editor?" inquired the editor kindly, as he admired
\par the shape of the young woman's nose.
\par 
\par "No," she answered, stroking his hand (the hand, that is, of her
\par husband), "why, no."
\par 
\par "What has been his experience?" asked the editor, as the thought of all
\par the hard work he had to do in the next hour and a half wrestled in his
\par mind with his pleasure in the young woman's voice.
\par 
\par "Why," she said, "before he went into the army I don't know that he had
\par any particular experience. He was just out of college, you see."
\par 
\par "Oh!" said the editor, "I see. And why," he asked musingly, "do you want
\par him to be an editor?"
\par 
\par "Well, I don't know exactly," answered the young woman, "I just thought
\par it would be rather nice to have him be an editor."
\par 
\par Even so. Day after day, come into publishing houses young persons, and
\par indeed people of all ages, who have a hunch (and apparently nothing more
\par to go by) that they would like to be "an editor." Also, in every other
\par mail, come letters from aspirants in distant parts setting forth (what
\par they deem) their qualifications.
\par 
\par Now and then someone makes such an application who has been an editor
\par before. It (editing) is probably the only business he knows, and perhaps
\par it is too late (or his spirit is too broken) for him to take up another.
\par So, disillusioned but not misguided, for him there is charity of
\par thought. But the fledglings are in the great majority. Their
\par qualifications (is it necessary to say?) usually are: a university
\par degree, perhaps some association with a college paper, maybe the credit
\par of an article (or a poem) or two published in a minor magazine issued
\par for the Intelligentzia, a very sincere attachment to books of superior
\par worth, a disdain for empyreal literature, openness to a modest salary
\par (to begin), and an abysmal lack of any comprehension of the business of
\par publishing books or magazines. Every little bit turns up one who (it
\par develops) wants a job on the side, as it were, merely to sustain the
\par real business of life, which (maybe) is taking a graduate course at
\par Columbia, or some such thing. And in many cases (it is obvious) the real
\par business of life is writing poetry, or fiction, though to this end a
\par job must be endured--doubtless temporarily.
\par 
\par Now why anyone should want to be an editor beats me. No, I retract. 'Tis
\par quite plain. Ignorance, ma'am, sheer ignorance of the calamity. I know
\par an editor; in fact, I know six. One, indeed, is a brother of mine,
\par another is a cousin, a third an uncle. Before they became editors they
\par used to read books and magazines--for pleasure, sometimes; or again for
\par profit to their souls. Now they do neither. They read only
\par professionally. They can't read anything unless they have to, in the way
\par of business. Before they became editors they led intellectual lives;
\par spiritually they grew continually. They used to be perfectly delighted,
\par excited (as people should be), by hearing of books, of authors, new to
\par them. They were fascinated by the journey of their minds. They might
\par have gone on thus through their years, interested in themselves,
\par interesting to others, pillars of society. They might even, for all
\par their thoughts (then) were inspirations, have written delightful things
\par themselves. In fact, two of them did. But they became editors.
\par 
\par Now they, subconsciously, count the words of manuscripts. They cut
\par articles, like cloth, to fit. They gauge the "rate" to be paid for
\par this, for that. They cannot take an interest in this because something
\par like it has just appeared somewhere else. They can't take an interest in
\par that because it is not like something that has just made a hit somewhere
\par else. Now when they have something to read they say (like Plim, Bimm,
\par whatever his name was, the veteran hack novelist in the early Barrie
\par story), "I'll begin the damn thing at eight o'clock."
\par 
\par Worst of all, they have lost, totally lost, that shield against
\par adversity, that great joy in days of prosperity, that deep satisfaction
\par of life. I mean, of course, the relish of _buying_ books. Everyone knows
\par that to revel in the possession of a book one must covet it before one
\par feels one should buy it. Everyone knows that to love a book jealously
\par one must have made some sacrifice to obtain it. That a library which
\par supplies unending strength to the spirit means in all its parts, a
\par little here, a little there, some self-denial of other things.
\par 
\par But editors, poor fish, are impotent in this high and lasting pleasure;
\par they have lost the power to spend their money for books. They expect
\par books to be given to them free by the publishers. Their money goes for
\par Kelley pool and cigars.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXVI
\par 
\par A DIP INTO THE UNDERWORLD
\par 
\par 
\par "When I go back home," he said, "and tell them about this they won't
\par believe it."
\par 
\par It was a pleasant April Sunday afternoon. We were sitting very
\par comfortably in a saloon over Third Avenue way about the middle of
\par Manhattan Island. Throngs of customers came and went through the front
\par door, whose wicket gate was seldom still. Whiskey glasses twinkled and
\par tinkled all along the long bar. Only here and there in the closely
\par packed line of patrons stood one with a tall "schooner" of beer before
\par him. Harry and Ed, in very soiled white jackets, led an active life.
\par 
\par You see, since theoretically intoxicants were not being sold, there was
\par no occasion for the pretence of being closed on Sunday and confining
\par business to the side door and the back room. On the table between us lay
\par a newspaper. Its headlines proclaimed yesterday's "liquor raids,"
\par thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of "rum" confiscated by the
\par city police in the progress of the campaign resulting from the recent
\par passage of the New York State "dry" law.
\par 
\par At the bottom of the page was a little story of the conviction of a
\par delicatessen dealer somewhere on the outskirts of Brooklyn on whose
\par premises had been discovered by the authorities a small amount of wine
\par containing more than one-half of one per cent alcohol.
\par 
\par Pete came in hurriedly. Harry and Ed glanced at him questioningly. He
\par nodded to them as though to say "yes," and dropped into the chair before
\par us. "They're comin'," he remarked. "About half a block off." Every
\par whiskey glass had suddenly disappeared from the bar.
\par 
\par Pete, a little grey man now of about fifty who arises for the day at
\par about noon, has had an interesting career. Once upon a time he was a
\par "bell-hop" in Albany. He is a devoted patron of the silent drama and a
\par man of intellectual interests--making a hobby of clipping from
\par newspapers poems and editorials which impress him and reading them
\par several months later to chance acquaintances who are too drowsy to
\par oppose him. His connection with this establishment is light and
\par picturesque. His duties are chiefly social. That is, he sees home one
\par after another customers who require that friendly attention. He is
\par perpetually agreeable to the suggestion of gratuitous refreshment. He is
\par very cheerful and gentlemanly in the matter of accommodating his tastes
\par to any liquid from ten-cent beer to ninety-cent Scotch which the
\par purchaser is disposed to pay for.
\par 
\par Here they were! The two police officers strolled in slowly, smiling. In
\par their blue and their gold buttons they looked very respendent against
\par the somewhat shabby scene. Ranged along before the bar were a number of
\par young men in the uniform of private soldiers. There were several
\par sailors. Here was a postman cheering himself on his rounds. There was a
\par huge fellow the nickel plate on whose cap announced that he was a piano
\par mover. The centre of a group, there was a very large man who looked as
\par though he had something darkly to do with ward politics. At one place in
\par the line was a very dapper little Japanese, who produced his money from
\par a wallet carried in his breast pocket. But mostly the motley company was
\par of the riff-raff order of humanity. That is another one of the curious
\par developments of "prohibition." Here, in all places of this character,
\par you may find an endless number of the sort of men who used to be
\par accustomed to paying as little as ten cents for a drink of very fiery
\par and inferior whiskey, now standing before the bar by the hour and paying
\par from fifty to seventy-five cents for whiskey (if you can call it that)
\par considerably worse. How on earth can they do it? I do not know.
\par 
\par The two policemen moved the length of the room, and came to a halt at
\par the open end of the bar. Here they stood for a couple of moments,
\par observing (I felt with some amusement) Harry and Ed serving their
\par beakers of beer. Then, as though suddenly having a bright idea, one of
\par them made his way along back of the bar to the cigar case at the front
\par end. He stooped, opened the sliding panel at the bottom of this and
\par poked around inside with his club. As he came along behind the bar back
\par to the open end he stooped several times to peer at the shelf below. He
\par joined his comrade, the two of them thrust their heads into the back
\par room, and then moved out through the side door.
\par 
\par "Well, we're safe for another hour," said Pete. "Why couldn't they find
\par the stuff?" I asked him. "I'll bet you couldn't find it if you'd go
\par behind the bar yourself," he answered. Harry and Ed had found it within
\par two seconds after the shadow of the law had lifted. And the room was
\par humming with the sound of renewed, and somewhat hectic, conviviality.
\par "We'll get caught pretty soon though, I guess," observed Johnnie, the
\par Italian "chef," who on week-days served the economical lunch of roast
\par beef sandwiches and "hot dogs." Harry and Ed laughed in a rather
\par uncomfortable way. But for the present, at least, business was too brisk
\par for their thoughts to be distracted more than a second or two from the
\par job.
\par 
\par "The old man," remarked Pete, referring to the proprietor, "is on a toot
\par again. Been under the weather for about a week now. He always gets that
\par way whenever one of the new law scares comes along. Gets worried or sore
\par or something and that upsets him."
\par 
\par Pete hadn't been very well himself for several days. Sick in bed, he
\par said, yesterday. He never used to be sick at all, "in the old days," he
\par declared, no matter how much he had taken the day before. Never had a
\par headache, or bad stomach, or anything like that. A little nervous,
\par perhaps, yes. "But it's the kind of stuff we get nowadays," he thought.
\par "There hasn't been time since prohibition started for the system to get
\par trained to react to this TNT stuff, like it was to regular liquor. Maybe
\par in ten years or in the next generation people's systems will have got
\par adjusted to this kind of poison and it'll be all right with 'em." It's
\par an interesting idea, I think.
\par 
\par A customer was requesting Ed to "fix him up" a pint flask. No, it
\par couldn't be done just now, as the supply was running too low for it to
\par be passed out that much at a time. The disappointed customer tried to
\par content himself with endeavoring to absorb as much of a pint as he could
\par obtain through a rapidly consumed series of single drinks. And pretty
\par soon it was officially announced from the bar that there would be "no
\par more until nine o'clock in the morning." I gathered that the reserve
\par stock was upstairs or downstairs and that the "old man" had gone away
\par with the key.
\par 
\par We went forth to take a walk, Pete accompanying us as a sort of
\par cicerone, and discoursing with much erudition of bar-rooms as we went.
\par "These places are getting scarce," he observed. "There don't seem to be
\par any, or there seems to be hardly any of the old places uptown," I
\par remarked. "Oh! no; not in residential neighborhoods," he replied; and I
\par inferred that the law was, in deference to the innocent spirit of
\par domesticity, keener-eyed there. "And there ain't but very few below the
\par dead-line downtown," Pete said.
\par 
\par They have, the bars, very largely disappeared from Broadway. Have been
\par gone from that thoroughfare for some time. And in this thought we come
\par upon one of the great mockeries of the situation which has existed since
\par the Eighteenth Amendment went (more or less) into effect. What I mean is
\par this: A great many people who had no ferocious opposition to the idea of
\par a cocktail being drunk before a meal, or wine with it, or even a liqueur
\par after it, did detest the saloon. It was the institution of the common,
\par corner saloon, I fancy, at which the bulk of American temperance
\par sentiment was directed.
\par 
\par The perverse operation of prohibition then was this: It ceased to be
\par possible (openly) to obtain any alcoholic beverage in anything like
\par wholesome surroundings, in a first-class restaurant or hotel or in a
\par gentleman's club. But in New York City, as is known to everybody who
\par knows anything at all about the matter, the saloons, and particularly
\par the lower class of saloons, have flourished as never before.
\par 
\par As we crossed Broadway Pete pointed out one place which had been going
\par until a short time ago, an odious looking place (as I remember it)
\par within. It was but a short way from a club of distinguished membership.
\par So much had this doggery become frequented by these gentlemen that it
\par became jocularly known among them as the "club annex."
\par 
\par Continuing on over into the West Side, here was a place, now a shop
\par dealing in raincoats, but formerly a "gin-mill" where throughout this
\par last winter there had been an extraordinary infusion of Bacardi rum,
\par drunk neat, as their favorite drink, by its multitudinous customers. And
\par there was a place, a baby carriage exhibited for sale in its window now,
\par which as a saloon had burned out one night not long ago; when its
\par proprietor accepted the catastrophe with striking cheerfulness, withdrew
\par his business activities to his nearby apartment and took up calling upon
\par old customers by appointment. Innumerable the places over which Pete
\par breathed a sigh, which had lately turned into tobacco stores or candy
\par shops.
\par 
\par We turned in at a door on Sixth Avenue. A little more caution seemed to
\par be observed here than at the place we had just left. But Pete, of
\par course, would pass any scrutiny. The liquor bottle, you noted, stood
\par within the safe at the inner end of the bar, its door hanging ready at
\par any moment to be kicked to. The barman covered with his hand the little
\par glasses he set out until you took them, and admonished, "Get away with
\par it!" The drinks were eighty cents a throw, but they had the feel of
\par genuine good-grade rye.
\par 
\par Night had fallen. We passed into the back room, where a pathetic object
\par was banging dismal tunes on a rattle-trap of a piano. A party of four
\par entered. The young women were very young and decidedly attractive. The
\par two couples began to circle about in a dance. Next moment came a
\par terrific thundering on the front of the building. "Cop wants less
\par noise," said the waiter to the dancers; "you'll have to quit." "Throw
\par that into you," he said to the seated customer he was serving, and
\par directly whisked away the glasses.
\par 
\par "When I go back home," said my friend from the Middle West, "and tell
\par them about this they won't believe it."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXVII
\par 
\par NOSING 'ROUND WASHINGTON
\par 
\par 
\par I
\par 
\par I came very near to being shot in the White House grounds the other day.
\par Yep! You see, my friend is a bit on the order of what the modistes call
\par "stylish stout." Rather more than a bit, indeed. Looks something like a
\par slightly youthfuller Irvin Cobb. Also wouldn't consider it decent of him
\par out of doors not to "wear" his stag-handled cane. Altogether, not
\par unlikely to be taken for a real somebody. He was fishing round in his
\par breast pocket for the letter his senator from "back home" had given him
\par to the President's secretary. Drew out what may have seemed an important
\par looking document.
\par 
\par As we came along the path toward the executive offices there was an
\par up-stage looking bunch thronging about the little steps--rollicking
\par gamins, smartly turned out flappers, a sprinkling of rather rakish
\par looking young males, and (in their best black silk) a populous
\par representation of those highly honorable and very ample figures who have
\par generously mothered the young sons and daughters of the American
\par prairies.
\par 
\par Suddenly from the side lines they popped out--a whole battery of them,
\par with their bug-like machines on tall stilts. The motion picture camera
\par men were taking no chances that anything important would escape their
\par fire. Evidently they couldn't quite place us, however, so we got through
\par the door without further incident.
\par 
\par When we had entered the grounds through the gate at the far side of the
\par lawn my thoughtful friend had thrown away his lighted cigar, feeling
\par that promiscuous smoking here would be taboo from danger of fire to so
\par precious a national jewel as the White House. Within the anteroom to the
\par executive offices the scene very decidedly suggested one of those jovial
\par masculine gatherings termed a "smoker." The seething and motley company
\par of (obviously) newspaper men put one in mind of the recent arrival at a
\par military training camp of a nondescript batch of drafted men not yet got
\par into uniform. General air about the room of loafing in a corner cigar
\par store.
\par 
\par Then, suddenly, a rising murmur and a pell-mell push toward the door. My
\par friend and I were swayed out upon the step, and saw at the gate directly
\par at the street corner of the building the movie camera men very
\par vigorously clearing for action. They had halted close before them a
\par tall, striking and very distinguished figure. You instantly recognized
\par him by the insignia which he wore on the slope toward his chin of his
\par under lip--a wisp of whisker (light straw color) such as decorated the
\par illustrious countenance, too, of the late James Abbott McNeil Whistler.
\par 
\par He was, this gentleman, looking very sheepish, continually bowing in a
\par rather strained manner to the camera men and lifting his black derby hat
\par to them. They were scrambling about the legs of their engines and
\par cranking away with a rattle. "Over this way a little, Mr. Paderewski!"
\par yelled one. "Hold on, Mr. Paderewski, there you are!" bawled another.
\par Boisterous mirth about the doorway.... "That's good!" "Sure, he's only a
\par premier."
\par 
\par Then, a deferential scattering to make way for him as he approached.
\par Held him up again, the camera guerrillas, on the steps. He was bowing
\par with an effect of increasing strain and the intensity of his
\par sheepishness becoming painful to contemplate. His hair a white bush
\par thrusting out behind. Ghostly white bow tie. His black clothes
\par beautifully sleek and pressed. At close up, his features blunter, less
\par sensitive in chiselling than appears in his photographs. The flesh of
\par his face striking in the degree of the pinkness and fairness of
\par complexion of the races of Northern Europe.
\par 
\par My friend and I had not yet seen Mr. Christian. Had that morning called
\par upon Mr. Tumulty on a matter of business. Found he had set up shop in a
\par business structure called the Southern Building. Transom Legend: Law
\par Offices ... Joseph P. Tumulty. On entrance door: Joseph P. Tumulty,
\par Charles H. Baker. Outstanding feature of ante-chamber a life-size cream
\par plaster bust, on tall polished wood pedestal, of Woodrow Wilson. Mr.
\par Tumulty, stocky of stature, driving in manner, bustled forth from his
\par private office. Exhaled atmosphere of ruddiness.
\par 
\par My friend at times (I fear) speaks with some circumlocution. Our real
\par business here settled, he was ambling on toward the expression of his
\par hope that we might possibly be able sometime, just for a moment, to see,
\par just get a glimpse of....
\par 
\par "The President," Mr. Tumulty cut in, with an anticipating nod. My friend
\par looked a bit confused as (I could see) the words "the ex-President" were
\par about to come from him. But, undoubtedly, both of them meant the same
\par gentleman.
\par 
\par In the executive offices we trailed along with the newspaper men for
\par their daily afternoon interview with Mr. Christian, my friend bathing
\par himself in tobacco smoke as complacently as anyone of the party. Entered
\par a sort of council chamber. Long table down the middle. Conspicuous
\par ornament of the apartment, on a mantel, a plaster cast of a humorous
\par Uncle Sam in a dress coat, holding aloft an American flag, and flanked
\par by a turkeyfied looking eagle.
\par 
\par Congregation pressed close about the table, behind which in a swivel
\par chair sat in a relaxed and rather pensive attitude an angular figure,
\par swinging leisurely looking legs which terminated in very white sox and
\par low-cut shoes. A rather thick thatch of greying hair, large aquiline
\par features, a rather melancholy cast of expression, eyes cast downward at
\par the table, clothes not recently pressed and which no one would be
\par inclined to call dapper, Mr. Christian in general effect suggested a
\par good deal one's impression of a somewhat dusty "reference librarian" at
\par the information desk of the New York Public Library being besieged by an
\par unusually large number of questioners.
\par 
\par "Well, gentlemen," he uttered very quietly and slowly, "what have you
\par got on your mind?"
\par 
\par "George," asked a figure with pad and pencil in hand, "what about this?"
\par Mr. Christian appeared to ponder the matter a good while, and the upshot
\par of his cogitation appeared to be that there wasn't much of anything
\par about it. "And what is there to that?" inquired another. Well at length
\par there didn't seem to be much to that either. A few items of information
\par were given. And the audience briefly closed.
\par 
\par When we had filed out with the company from the room my friend and I
\par took seats in the corridor. He had given his letter to the doorman. A
\par couple of soldiers in uniform, a group of very spruce, robust and
\par cheery-looking Catholic priests, an elderly individual of very dejected
\par pose, and a miscellaneous assortment of humanity also were waiting. The
\par doorman was being continually accosted. "Just want to shake hands with
\par him, that's all," and "Just want to say 'How de do'," were solicitations
\par frequently overheard.
\par 
\par The doorman beckoned to us and told us to go into an apartment which he
\par indicated and "take a seat." Probably my friend didn't hear that
\par instruction, as he marched straight up to Mr. Christian directly upon
\par entering the room flooded with afternoon light pouring through an
\par imposing row of tall and beautiful windows. Mr. Christian slowly arose
\par from his desk, coming gradually to his full height, and yielded a
\par cautious hand to my friend. He looked at the bright and somewhat
\par flustered countenance of my friend rather sadly, as it seemed. Though at
\par some sally of my friend's about the pronunciation of his name he smiled
\par with considerable natural human warmth. Then very gravely he stated that
\par with so many appointments at present to be made, and with the
\par multitudinous labors now upon him, and so forth and so on, it was hardly
\par possible that he could just now arrange for my friend to have a word
\par with, as he said, ... "the Senator."
\par 
\par My friend was, obviously, a bit taken aback by the term, as his mind
\par had been careering along with visions of his seeing no less a person
\par than the President. But there was no doubt that both he and Mr.
\par Christian were referring to the same gentleman.
\par 
\par I should add that my friend's self-imposed mission of shaking hands with
\par Mr. Harding and writing an article about his impressions of him before
\par the President had yet given an audience to the accredited
\par representatives of the press was more or less audacious. And I should
\par add still further that Mr. Christian seemed genuinely reluctant to
\par dismiss my friend without a ray of hope, and suggested that he call
\par again after a few days. Suggestion was at Mr. Christian's own volition.
\par 
\par As we turned to leave the room we saw that the bevy of Catholic Fathers
\par and several other persons had also been admitted, and were all beaming
\par with bland cheerful confidence.
\par 
\par We strolled along the driveway leading by the front entrance to the
\par White House. The baggy looking policeman lazily sunning himself beside
\par the portico recalled to my mind with amusing contrast the snappy
\par Redcoats who briskly pace back and forth before Buckingham Palace.
\par 
\par They are superbly haughty and disdainful beings. A charmingly democratic
\par character, this policeman. "'At a fierce cloud over there," he observed
\par to us as we paused nearby.
\par 
\par A splendid looking army officer together with a caped naval commander
\par emerged with springy step from the White House door, both carrying an
\par air of high elation. A sumptuous car rolled up and halted beneath the
\par portico roof extending over the driveway. From it a lady leaned out
\par extending a card. Out pranced a gleaming negro flunky to receive it with
\par bows of elaborate courtliness. As he turned to re-enter the White House
\par it struck me that I did not believe I had ever seen a happier looking
\par human being. Also, in his beautiful dark blue tail coat with bright
\par silver buttons, and delicately striped light waistcoat, he brought to my
\par mind (incongruously enough) the waiters at Keen's Chop House. The lady
\par rolled on.
\par 
\par A bumptious looking character mounted to the entrance, and sent in a
\par card. It was evident in his bearing that he expected within a moment to
\par stride through the doorway. A figure in a skirt coat emerged. Bumptious
\par being springs upon him and begins to pump his hand up and down with
\par extraordinary verve, straining the while toward the doorway. Skirt coat
\par (his hand continuing to be pumped) deferentially edges bumptious
\par character outward toward descending steps.
\par 
\par It had been an exceedingly hot day for early spring. Traffic policemen
\par had stood on their little platforms at the centre of the street
\par crossings under those mammoth parasols they have to shield them from the
\par rigors of the Washington sun. As we proceeded toward our exit from the
\par grounds, approaching to the White House came a diminutive and decrepit
\par figure muffled in an overcoat extending to his heels, bowed under a tall
\par top hat, a pair of mighty ear-muffs clamped over his ears.
\par 
\par We had that morning visited the Capitol. My friend had been much more
\par interested in the guide-conducted touring parties than in the atrocious
\par painting of the Battle of Lake Erie, and so on, expatiated on to them.
\par Parties which, he said, made him feel that he was back again at the
\par Indiana State Fair. We had sat, in the visitors' gallery of the Senate,
\par in the midst of a delegation of some sort of religious sect, whose
\par beards had most decidedly the effect of false whiskers very insecurely
\par attached. Had been much struck by the extreme politeness of a new
\par Senator who bowed deeply to each one in turn of a row of pages he passed
\par before. Had responded within a few minutes to the command of "All out!"
\par because of executive meeting, and sympathised with the sentiments of
\par fellow citizens likewise ejected who went forth murmuring that they
\par hadn't "got much."
\par 
\par We had wandered through the noble and immaculate Senate Office building,
\par and been much impressed by the scarcity of spittoons there, an abundance
\par of which articles of furniture we had since boyhood associated with all
\par public buildings. We had sat in the outer office of our state's senator,
\par and listened to one lady after another explain to his secretary in this
\par wise: "I just made up my mind ... I just decided to go right after it
\par ... I just determined ... I just thought ... Otherwise, of course, I
\par shouldn't presume to ask it."
\par 
\par In the Library of Congress we had been much interested to hear an
\par European gentleman of vast erudition connected with the Library declare
\par that "there was more intellectual life in Washington than in any other
\par city in America--that it was an European city, in the best sense." We
\par had been accosted on the street by a very portly and loud-voiced man who
\par introduced himself by inquiring where we were from; who confided that
\par his business in Washington had to do with an alcohol permit; and who
\par asked to be directed to Corcoran Gallery. We had run into an old actor
\par friend who was here playing, he said, "nut stuff"; and who observed that
\par Washington was "more of a boob town than ever." We had been assured by a
\par newspaper friend that Washington was so full of inventors and blue law
\par fans that if you "dropped a match anywhere a nut would step on it."
\par 
\par We had been charmed by the vast number of elderly couples apparently on
\par a final mellow honeymoon before the fall of the curtain. At lunch had
\par overheard an inland matron inquire of a waitress if scollops were
\par "nice." Had enjoyed hot corn bread with every meal. Had been unable to
\par account for the appearance on the streets of so many wounded soldiers.
\par Had made the mistake of getting up so early that in the deep Washington
\par stillness of half past seven we were scared to run the water for our
\par baths for fear of rousing the sleeping hotel to angry tumult. Had noted
\par that nowhere except in London is the fashion of freshly polished shoes
\par so much an institution. Had speculated as to why the standard model of
\par the American statesman's hat should be a blend of an expression of the
\par personalities of W. J. Bryan, Buffalo Bill and Colonel Watterson.
\par 
\par And, finally, listening in the evening to the orchestra in the corridor
\par of the New Willard, we discussed the large opportunities for a serious
\par literary work dealing with the varieties and idiosyncrasies of the
\par Washington hair cut. There is the Bryan type, with the hair turned
\par outward in a thick roll above the back of the neck, and forming a neat
\par hat rest. There is the roach back from a noble dome. There is the grey
\par curly bushy all around. There is the heavy grey wave mounting high over
\par one side. And--well, there seem to be an almost endless number of
\par styles, all more or less peculiar to the spirit of Washington, and all
\par of distinct distinction.
\par 
\par 
\par II
\par 
\par "Who's the old bird gettin' so many pictures took?" inquired a loitering
\par passerby.
\par 
\par A hum of much good nature was coming from the motley throng about the
\par steps before the executive office of the White House. "Beer and light
\par wine," called out someone, apparently in echo to something just said by
\par the queer looking character being photographed by the battery of camera
\par men, and a rattle of laughter went around through the group.
\par 
\par "That's old Coxey," replied someone. "He's down here to get Debs out,"
\par he added. The amiable and celebrated "General" who a number of years ago
\par had led his "army" on to Washington was smiling like a very wrinkled and
\par animated potato into the lenses of the cameras which had been moved to
\par within a couple of feet or so of his nose.
\par 
\par My friend and I crossed the street to the State, Army and Navy building.
\par We had been there the other day to see a young man in the State
\par Department to whom he had a card. Had been much struck by his beauty.
\par And had wondered if handsomeness was a requisite for a statesman in this
\par Administration.
\par 
\par Now we sought the press room. Presented our credentials to a press
\par association man there. Cordial chap. Said, "Stick around." Others
\par floated in. Pretty soon press association man heartily calls out to my
\par friend (whose name is Augustus), "George. Come on!" And we trail along
\par with about fifty others into the ante-chamber of the new Secretary of
\par the Navy, who at half past ten is to give his first interview to the
\par newspaper men.
\par 
\par Funny looking corridors, by the way, in this building. Swing doors all
\par about, constructed of horizontal slats, and in general effect bearing a
\par picturesque resemblance to the doors of the old-time saloon.
\par 
\par I noticed that as we went along my friend punched in one side of the
\par crown of his soft hat and raked it somewhat to one side of his head. He
\par felt, I suspected, uncomfortably neat for the society of this bonhomie
\par crowd of bona fide newspaper men, and did not wish to appear aloof by
\par being too correct in attire.
\par 
\par The company passed along the corridor and into the anteroom under a
\par heavy head of tobacco smoke. There the press association man presented
\par each of the flock in turn to a chubby little fellow behind a railing,
\par whom I took to be secretary to the Secretary; and presently the
\par delegation was admitted to the inner office, a spacious apartment where
\par one passed first an enormous globe, then a large model of the _Old
\par Kearsarge_ in a glass case; and at length we ranged ourselves closely
\par before a mountain of a man in a somewhat saggy suit. Clean shaven,
\par massive features, very bald dome, widely smiling, Secretary Denby looks
\par just a bit (I thought) like Mr. Punch. His voice comes in a deep rumble
\par and he has entirely ample ears. Trousers too long.
\par 
\par No; he had not seen the story in that morning's paper which was handed
\par to him by one of the reporters. He would not confirm this; he would not
\par deny that. After all, he had been "only a week in the job." And one
\par might so very easily be "injudicious." "Wily old boy," was one comment
\par as the party trailed out and made for the press telephones, discussing
\par among themselves "how would you interpret" this and that?
\par 
\par Next, at eleven o'clock, the Secretary of State was down on the
\par newspaper men's schedule. We went into a kind of waiting room across the
\par corridor from the real offices of the Secretary. Most conspicuous
\par decoration a huge painting of a Bey of Tunis, the presentation of which
\par (the inscription said) had something to do with condolences from France
\par on the death of Lincoln. Also on one wall a portrait of Daniel Webster.
\par 
\par Mr. Fletcher, Under Secretary of State, appeared before us. Very dapper
\par gentleman. Athletic in build. Fashionable clothes. Grey hair but
\par youthful in effect. Handsome, smooth-shaven face. Suggested an actor, or
\par perhaps a very gentlemanly retired pugilist. Held beautiful shell
\par spectacles in hand before him. Stood very straight. Had another fellow
\par alongside of him to supply information when himself in doubt. When asked
\par concerning someone who was in jail, inquired "Where is the old boy?"
\par Smiling cordially, seeking continually for an opportunity for some joke
\par or pleasantry, trying bravely to keep up a strong front, but obviously
\par becoming more and more uneasy under the ordeal of rapid-fire questions
\par about Russia, Germany, Japan and so on and so on. On being asked
\par concerning diplomatic appointments under consideration, bowed briskly,
\par replied "A great many," and escaped--almost, it might be said, fled.
\par 
\par Secretary of War next on the list. Full length portraits in his offices
\par of Generals Pershing, Bliss and Petain. Many flags, historic ones
\par (presumably) in glass cases. Heavy build, Secretary Weeks, very wide
\par across the middle. Straggling moustache, drooping. Very direct and
\par business-like in manner. Entered room saying, "Well, there are a number
\par of things I have to tell you gentlemen." Frank and positive in his
\par statements and denials. Stood twisting a key-ring as he talked. Wore
\par neat pin in tie. When told that the War Department was supposed to have
\par such and such a thing under consideration, he replied, tapping himself
\par on the breast, "Not this part of the War Department." One questioner
\par sought to obtain from him a more direct reply to a question that had
\par been put to the Secretary of the Navy. He answered, "I know nothing
\par about the navy." When there was apparently nothing more that he had to
\par say, he concluded the audience very deftly.
\par 
\par "He's a different guy, ain't he?" was one correspondent's observation as
\par we passed out of the room. "One of the biggest men in the government,"
\par he added. "Gives the impression of knowing as much about that job now as
\par Baker did when he left."
\par 
\par To the National Press Club we went for lunch. It is pleasant to see in
\par what esteem this club holds those two eminent journalists, Eugene Field
\par and Napoleon Bonaparte, whose portraits hang framed side beside on one
\par of its walls. Napoleon, however, is held in such very great regard as a
\par newspaper man that another and larger picture of him hangs in another
\par room.
\par 
\par The newspaper army had shifted to the business office of the White
\par House. As we entered Secretary Weeks was departing. He pressed through
\par the throng of reporters clustered about him. "Nothing to say," was
\par apparently what he was saying. "We are referred to Warren," said one of
\par the men. "Looks like we really were going to see him," said another. The
\par President had not yet given an interview to the press men. So we took
\par seats among the rows of figures ranged around the walls.
\par 
\par While waiting we were given an audience, so to say, by Laddie, the White
\par House Airedale. Curly haired breed. "How old is he?" we asked the small
\par colored boy whose office includes charge of him. "A year," he said. The
\par dog stands well, and holds his stump of a tail straight aloft, correctly
\par enough. But there is altogether too much black on him, we observed;
\par covers his breast and flanks, instead of being merely a "saddle" on his
\par back. "Yes, everybody says it," answered the boy.
\par 
\par Secretary Hughes was seen coming down the corridor on his way out. The
\par newspaper men pressed forward forming a narrow line through which he
\par walked, very erect, smiling broadly, bowing to right and left, and
\par continually moving his black derby hat up and down before him. "Gets a
\par great reception, don't he?" said one reporter, glowing with a sort of
\par jovial pride at Mr. Hughes.
\par 
\par "You'll have to see the boss," Mr. Hughes repeated a number of times as
\par he came along, and turning slightly made one last very good-natured bow
\par as he moved out through the door.
\par 
\par "Are they all here?" called out Mr. Christian, then marshalled us
\par through his office and into the large, circular and very handsome office
\par of the President.
\par 
\par While we awaited him he could be seen, through a doorway, talking, on a
\par porch-like structure opening out along the back of the building. He was
\par very leisurely in manner. I think my first outstanding impression of my
\par glimpse of him was that he was a very handsome man, most beautifully
\par dressed in a dark blue serge sack suit, very sharply pressed.
\par 
\par He came in, moving slowly, stood close behind his desk, and said,
\par "Well, gentlemen, what is there that I can tell you?" He spoke very
\par quietly and deliberately. The Cabinet he said had discussed problems
\par relating to the "hang-over" (as he put it) of the War, in particular the
\par trade situation of the world. He mentioned that he did not desire to be
\par quoted directly. He had not been "annoyed" but he had been "distressed,"
\par he said, by having been so quoted not long ago. The top button of his
\par coat was buttoned. His cuffs were stiffly starched. He inclined his head
\par a good part of the time to one side. Sometimes half closed his eyelids.
\par Then would open them very wide, and make an outward gesture with his
\par hands, accompanied by something like a shrug of the shoulders. Close up
\par I was struck by the bushiness of his eyebrows. He wore a single ring,
\par mounting a rather large light stone. No pin to his tie. He swung
\par backward and forward on his feet. Put on shell-rimmed nose glasses to
\par read. Sometimes pursed his lips slowly. As he talked absently rolled a
\par small piece of paper he had picked up from his desk into the shape of a
\par cigarette. His talk had a slightly oratorical roll. He was exceedingly
\par patient and exceedingly courteous. His general atmosphere was one of
\par deep kindness. In conclusion he said, "Glad to see you again."
\par 
\par "That's pretty nice," was the comment of one of the newspaper men as we
\par emerged from his presence.
\par 
\par As we moved away through the grounds my friend dilated on a somewhat
\par whimsical idea of his. This was to this effect. In motion picture plays
\par (my friend insisted) kings were always much more kingly in appearance
\par and manner than any modern king would be likely to be. But (he declared)
\par it would be very difficult for a motion picture concern to get hold of
\par any actor to play the part who would look so much like an American
\par President as President Harding.
\par 
\par We stopped in to look at the east room, now again open. A character who
\par had evidently not been born in any of the capitols of Europe was
\par admiring the place vastly. He looked with especial approval at the
\par enormous chandeliers, those great showers, or regular storms, of glass.
\par "Pretty hard to beat," was his patriotic comment.
\par 
\par 
\par III
\par 
\par It's a big old building, dark inside, the Washington Post Office. He
\par looked like some sort of a guard about the premises who was too tired
\par to stand up and so did his guarding sitting in a chair. My friend had
\par got so accustomed to inquiring our way to the office of Secretary
\par Hughes, and of Secretary Weeks, and so on, that he asked where we would
\par find Secretary Hays.
\par 
\par The man looked at us very contemptuously. "The Postmaster General?" at
\par length he boomed. Well, he was on the fifth floor. As we stepped from
\par the car my friend remarked on the practice universal in Washington of
\par men removing their hats when in the presence of women in elevators.
\par 
\par Our appointment was for ten o'clock. We had got quite used, however, to
\par waiting an hour or so for the gentlemen we sought to see. Several other
\par callers were ahead of us here, and we sat down in the outer office when
\par we had presented our cards to a very kind and attentive young man who
\par appeared to be in charge.
\par 
\par Within a very few minutes, however, we were ushered round into a
\par secluded inner office. "The General," the young man said, "will be in in
\par a moment. He sees them in two different rooms at the same time." This
\par large room was entirely bare of painting or other decorations.
\par 
\par Speaking of decorations reminds me of the striking handsomeness of the
\par Cabinet officers we had so far been seeing. Beginning with the President
\par himself (prize winner of the lot in this respect) the spectacle of this
\par Administration had up to this moment been a regular beauty show.
\par 
\par The physiognomy of Mr. Hays, of course, strikes a somewhat different
\par note in the picture. Though he is not, I should say, as funny looking as
\par some of his pictures suggest.
\par 
\par He fairly leaped into the room. Spidery figure. Calls you by your last
\par name without the prefix of Mister. Very, very earnest in effect. No
\par questions necessary to get him started. He began at once to talk. Poured
\par forth a steady stream of rapid utterance. Denounced the idea of labor as
\par a "commodity." Said: "We have a big job here. Three hundred thousand
\par employees. Millions of customers. I think we can do it all right,
\par though. But our people in the department all over the country everywhere
\par must be made to feel that a human spirit is behind them. It's in the
\par heart that the battle's won. It's because of the spirit behind them
\par whether our men throw a letter on the floor before a door or put it
\par through the door." Made a gesture with his hands illustrating putting a
\par letter through a door. Looked very hard at the very clean top of his
\par desk much of the time as he talked. Now and then looked very straight
\par indeed at us. Gave us a generous amount of his time. At length arose
\par very briskly.
\par 
\par Routed us out around through some side way. Had a private elevator
\par concealed somewhere in a dark corner. Turned us over to the colored man
\par in charge of it with the request, "Won't you please take my friends
\par down?"
\par 
\par As we were crossing the street we ran into our old friend from New York
\par who edits a very flourishing women's magazine. Down here, he said, to
\par get an article from Mrs. Harding. Had found her altogether willing to
\par supply him with an article, but in so much of a flutter with her new
\par activities that she didn't see her way to finding time soon to write it.
\par What, we asked, was the article to be about? Well, Mrs. Harding's idea
\par was to revive all the old traditions of the White House. And what were
\par those traditions? Mrs. Harding hadn't said beyond the custom of Easter
\par egg-rolling.
\par 
\par We were on our way over to see Assistant Secretary of the Navy
\par Roosevelt. He is not in the State, Army and Navy building where Mr.
\par Denby is, but some ten minutes' walk away, in the long, rather fragile
\par looking Navy Department building constructed during the War.
\par 
\par Here numerous gold-braided officers continually come and go. The
\par building is filled with very beautiful models of fighting ships. At one
\par side of Roosevelt's door is a model of the _San Diego_, at the other
\par side a "sample U. S. Navy Patrol Boat."
\par 
\par As we gave him our cards a young man asked us if we knew "the Colonel."
\par An old Washington newspaper man had told us that morning, "He will go
\par far under his own hat." Several very large men, also waiting, were
\par smoking very large cigars while we waited. While all male visitors to
\par public offices in Washington appear to smoke continually, those in
\par government positions apparently do not smoke during office hours. And
\par government business hours there seem to be queer. The Senate goes into
\par session at just about lunch time. The President seems to be around in
\par his business office throughout the whole of the middle of the day. And
\par the office of the Secretary of State telephones you at six o'clock
\par Saturday night.
\par 
\par The young man showed us in. Mr. Roosevelt arose from his desk, shook
\par hands very cordially, said "How do you do?" sat down again and at the
\par moment said nothing further. It was up to us to swing the conversation.
\par So my friend launched out: We had nothing to do with affairs of state,
\par had no design to interview him as to naval matters, simply were curious
\par to see if we should find him eating an apple and wearing white sox, or
\par what. With hearty good nature, Mr. Roosevelt replied that he was not
\par eating an apple because he did not have one to eat, and that he had only
\par once worn white sox, woolen ones, when a boy at school.
\par 
\par He was very neatly dressed in a suit of quiet dark material, wore rich
\par dark red tie, with a stick pin to it. Curiously weather beaten looking
\par complexion. As he has just published a book we asked him if he intended
\par to carry on more or less of a literary career together with his public
\par life. He said, well, perhaps more or less. But he wouldn't have time for
\par much such work. He "practised" writing on Saturdays and Sundays, but
\par mainly for the purpose of attaining to clearness in expressing himself.
\par He insisted that the great bulk of his father's writing had been done
\par _before_ the full course of his political activities and _after_ he had
\par retired from them.
\par 
\par After we had arisen to go he walked up and down the room with us, with a
\par somewhat arm-in-arm effect. Declared we should know a friend of his up
\par in Boston, because we'd "like him." Said to look in on him again any
\par time when in Washington. Very affable young man.
\par 
\par We went out on S Street to see Wilson's new house. Handsome enough
\par structure, but, undetached from the building next door and fronting
\par directly on the sidewalk, we decided that it looked somewhat more like a
\par club than like a private residence. Were told later that the part of
\par that house to look at is the back of it, as there are wonderful gardens
\par there.
\par 
\par One cannot fail to note in the numerous art shops where pictures of
\par Harding, Roosevelt, Washington, Lincoln and Cleveland are displayed in
\par abundance the relative absence of pictures of Wilson.
\par 
\par Why do august statesmen in the lobby of the New Willard cross their legs
\par so that we can see that their shoes need to be half-soled? Why do so
\par many distinguished looking gentlemen in Washington wear their overcoats
\par as though they were sleeveless capes? What on earth do so many Oklahoma
\par looking characters do in Washington? Why is it that there the masses do
\par not, as in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles, stroll about at night?
\par 
\par We stopped in again at the executive office of the White House.
\par Remarkable number of doormen there got up somewhat like policemen, so
\par that you repeatedly have to explain yourself all over again. Man new to
\par us on today. Suspiciously asked our names. Then (though what just our
\par names could have meant to him I cannot see) shook hands with immense
\par friendliness, and told us his name.
\par 
\par Quite a throng waiting. Busy hum all about. Different crowd from usual.
\par Hardly any reporters. Old gentlemen. Stout red-faced fellows with large
\par black slouch hats. Several youngish women with very generous bosom
\par displays. Some sort of a delegation, apparently. We did not make out
\par just what. But the scene somewhat suggested a meeting of the Los Angeles
\par branch of the Ohio Society. At length the company lines up. We trail in
\par through with the rest.
\par 
\par The President, looming in the centre of his office, shakes hands with
\par each caller in turn, in a manner of paternal affection. Holds your hand
\par very gently within his for a considerable while. Rather odd position he
\par takes when shaking hands. Right shoulder lifted. Looks (though I felt
\par that he was unconscious of this effect) somewhat like a pose that a
\par painter might put his model into when about to paint him shaking hands.
\par 
\par He bent over us in a very fatherly fashion. Said, yes, yes, he had got
\par our letters while in the South. Which was quite a mistake, as we hadn't
\par written him any letters. But his kindly intention was quite
\par unmistakable.
\par 
\par 
\par IV
\par 
\par Senator New's secretary, in his room on the second floor of the Senate
\par Office building, was opening a wooden box that had come by mail. No; he
\par wasn't exactly opening this box, either. He was looking at it
\par suspiciously and cautiously tipping it from side to side. "Feels like it
\par was a snake," he said fearsomely. "Soft, live-like weight in there. I
\par don't believe I'll open it. You see," indicating the stamps, "it's from
\par India, too."
\par 
\par "But why would anybody be sending Senator New a snake?" inquired my
\par friend.
\par 
\par "Goodness gracious! We get lots of things just as queer as snakes,"
\par replied Mr. Winter. "I guess the Senator must be coming in pretty soon,"
\par he remarked, glancing about. "So many people coming in," he added, and
\par continued: "It's a remarkable thing. Visitors seem to have some sort of
\par psychic knowledge of when the Senator will be in. Same way out in
\par Indianapolis, we could always tell when Tom Taggart was likely to be
\par back soon from French Lick--so many people (who couldn't have heard from
\par him) looking for him at the Denizen House."
\par 
\par "Everybody," someone observed, "always comes to Washington at least once
\par a year." All United-Statesians, at any rate, one would say looking about
\par the city, probably do. And among visiting United-Statesians not
\par habitually seen in such profusion elsewhere one would certainly include,
\par Indians, Mormons, Porto-Ricans, Civil War veterans, pedagogues,
\par octogenarians, vegetarians, Virginians, Creoles, pastors, suffragettes,
\par honeymooners, aunts, portly ladies of peculiar outline, people of a very
\par simple past, and a remarkable number of gentlemen who still cling to
\par white "lawn" ties, hard boiled shirts and "Congress shoes."
\par 
\par Also, of course, that vast congregation of people who "want" something
\par in Washington. "What are you looking for around here?" a remark commonly
\par overheard in the hotel lobbies.
\par 
\par But there are other American cities to which "everybody" goes, too, now
\par or then, though the visitors are not perhaps so recognizable. Coming out
\par of the Capitol, passing through the grounds of the White House, what do
\par you frequently overhear? Frequently some such remark as this: "Haven't
\par you ever been in the subway? To the Bronx? When you go back you
\par certainly must go in it."
\par 
\par And out in Los Angeles they boastfully tell you that one way in which
\par Los Angeles "is like New York" is this: That whereas a man may or may
\par not happen to go to Richmond or to Detroit, sooner or later you are
\par bound to see him on the streets of Los Angeles. That, as I say, is what
\par they tell you out there.
\par 
\par But what are those aspects of Washington which are peculiar to that
\par city, and make it so unlike any other city in the United States? And
\par which in some cases make it an influence for the bad to many of its
\par visitors? And which in some cases it is so strange should be the aspect
\par of such a city?
\par 
\par For one thing, the first thing which must strike any stranger to the
\par city is the enormous extent of the souvenir business there. It is
\par perhaps natural enough that this should be so, and that souvenir shops
\par should range themselves in an almost unbroken stretch for miles. What is
\par not altogether so easy to answer is why nearly all of the souvenirs
\par should be the kind of souvenirs they are.
\par 
\par Printed portraits of the present President and of former Presidents, and
\par plaster busts of these personages, of course. That many of the articles
\par for "remembrance" should be touched with a patriotic design, of course,
\par too. But why today should so many millions of the "souvenir spoons"
\par (with the Capitol in relief on the bowl), the "hand painted" plates
\par (presenting a comic valentine likeness of George Washington), the
\par paper-weights (with a delirious lithograph of the Library of Congress
\par showing through), the "napkin rings," butter knives, and so on and so
\par on--why should such millions of these things be precisely in the style
\par of such articles proudly displayed in the home of my grandmother when I
\par was a boy in the Middle West?
\par 
\par Outside of Washington, as far as I know in the world, any considerable
\par exhibition of wares so reminiscent of the taste of the past can only be
\par found along the water fronts of a city where men of ships shop. And
\par there, along water fronts, you always find that same idea of ornament.
\par 
\par Another thing. Where in Washington are shops where real art is
\par sold--paintings of reputable character and rare specimens of antique
\par furniture? They may be there; I do not swear that they are not, but they
\par are remarkably difficult to find.
\par 
\par Painting reminds me. The Corcoran Gallery is, of course, a justly famous
\par museum of art. But a minor museum, containing no Old Masters, but an
\par excellent collection of American painting, particularly excellent in its
\par representation of the period immediately preceding the present, the
\par period of the men called our impressionist painters. Its best canvas, I
\par should say, is the painting by John H. Twachtman, called (I believe)
\par "The Waterfall." My point is, that visitors there certainly are seeing
\par what they are supposed to be seeing there--art.
\par 
\par What I am coming to (and I do not know why someone does not come to it
\par oftener) is this: That hordes of people who come to Washington will look
\par at with wonder as something fine anything which is shown to them. The
\par numerous beautiful works of architecture--to which is now added the very
\par noble Lincoln Memorial--they see, and probably derive something from.
\par But the cultural benefits of their visits to their Mecca of patriotic
\par interest must be weirdly distorted when they are led gaping through the
\par Capitol and are charged twenty-five cents apiece to be told by a guard
\par who knows as much about paintings as an ashman a quantity of imbecile
\par facts about prodigious canvases atrociously bad almost beyond belief.
\par 
\par The Embarkation of the Pilgrims and Washington Resigning his Commission,
\par and so forth, indisputably are historic moments for the American breast
\par to recall with solemn emotion. And the iniquity of these paintings here
\par to minds uninstructed in works of art is that by reason of their appeal
\par to sentiments of love of country these nightmares of ugliness are put
\par over on the visitor as standards of beauty.
\par 
\par Still speaking (after a fashion) of "art," another aspect of Washington
\par hits the eye. And that is the extremely moral note here. In Los Angeles
\par (that other nation's playground of holiday makers) perhaps even more
\par picture cards are displayed for sale. A very merry lot of pictures,
\par those out there--all of "California bathing girls" and very lightly
\par veiled figures, limbs rythmically flashing in "Greek dances." Such
\par picture cards of gaiety of course may be found in windows here and there
\par on some streets in New York and other cities. But after much window
\par gazing I fancy that anybody bent upon buying such things in Washington
\par would have to get them from a bootlegger or someone like that.
\par 
\par And whereas, as I recall, in other centres of urban life, and especially
\par on the Pacific Coast, the photographers' exhibits run very largely to
\par feminine beauty and fashion, in photographers' windows in Washington,
\par you will note, masculine greatness dominates the scene.
\par 
\par Speaking of photographers and such-like suggests another thing. Let us
\par come at the matter in this way. A good many women of culture and means,
\par I understand, choose to live in Washington; probably in large measure
\par because the city is beautifully laid out, because it is a pleasant size,
\par because there are no factories and subways there, and so on. We know
\par that numerous retired statesmen prefer to remain there. There is society
\par of the embassies. In consideration of all this, and in consideration
\par further of the comparatively large leisure there for an American city,
\par you would suppose that, behind the transient population, in Washington,
\par a highly civilized life went on. Very well.
\par 
\par True, they have the third greatest reference library in the world and
\par the numerous scholars associated with it. But where do the people _buy_
\par their books? One bookstore of fair size. Another good but quite small. A
\par third dealing mainly in second-hand volumes. Not one shop devoted to
\par sets in fine bindings, first editions, rare items and such things.
\par Though in Philadelphia, for instance, there is one of the finest (if not
\par the finest) bookshops dealing in rare books anywhere in the world. In
\par San Francisco numerous bookstores. Larger cities? Yes (as to that part
\par of it), of course.
\par 
\par But it does seem queer that not a single newspaper in Washington runs
\par book reviews or prints any degree at all of literary comment.
\par 
\par Alluding to San Francisco, that happy dale of the _bon-vivant_, how does
\par he who likes good living make out in Washington, unless he lives in a
\par club, an embassy, or at the White House? A grand public market, two
\par first-class hotel dining-rooms, and many fine homes. But an earnest
\par seeker after eating as a fine art could find tucked away none of those
\par chop-houses and restaurants to dine in which enlarge the soul of man.
\par 
\par But, of course, perhaps you can't have everything at once. From the
\par visitors' gallery the spectacle of the Senate in active session is a
\par game more national than baseball. "There he goes!" cries one ardent
\par spectator, pointing to a "home player," so to say, moving down the
\par aisle. "That's him! Gettin' along pretty good, ain't he?"
\par

\par CHAPTER XXVIII
\par 
\par FAME: A STORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE
\par 
\par                           $10,000!
\par                 IN PRIZES FOR SHORT STORIES!
\par 
\par      _You_ have a story. We want to read it. Every human life has one
\par      great story in it. Every man, every woman, has at least one story
\par      to tell.
\par 
\par                       THIS MEANS YOU!
\par 
\par      From your experience, from your own heart history, you can draw a
\par      tale. You may not know that you can write. But you never know what
\par      you can do until you try. We believe there are thousands of
\par      unwritten little masterpieces, waiting only for the right
\par      encouragement to be produced. Here is our offer----
\par 
\par 
\par BENJAMIN KEYESER drew a long breath. "This means you"--there was no
\par doubt about that. These printed words had read his heart. He felt that
\par deep was answering unto deep.
\par 
\par A brief r\'e9sum\'e9 of his life passed through Keyes's mind. And he was
\par touched, as never before, by the romance of destiny. He had not
\par contrived to be called up to public charges or employments of dignity or
\par power in the world. When Ol' Necessity had tapped him on the shoulder he
\par had cut his scholastic pursuits short of college, and a family friend,
\par Dr. Nevens, had got him a fifth-rate job in a third-rate business
\par concern. Here it seemed extremely probable that he would spend a good
\par many of his days. By the continued exercise of steadiness of character,
\par diligence, and application, he might hope, as Dr. Nevens by way of
\par encouragement occasionally pointed out, to advance at the rate of a
\par couple of dollars or so every couple of years. Clerkdom hedged him about
\par as divinity doth a king.
\par 
\par The city directory rated him, "B. C. Keyes, Clerk." Should he be killed
\par in a railway accident, chosen as a juror, or arrested for homicide, the
\par newspapers would report that B. C. Keyes, a clerk, of 1120 Meredith
\par Street,--etc. There was, he felt when he looked at it fairly, no way
\par out. In the "Americans of Today" magazine articles, men rise from
\par bootblacks to multi-millionaires, but these legends, Keyes felt numbly,
\par had about as much relation to his own life as the hero tales of ancient
\par Greece. His lot was cast in the bottom of a well.
\par 
\par And yet,--Keyes had been considered a bright youngster at school; he
\par regarded himself as a rather bright young man now; and sometimes even
\par yet, in wayward, impractical moments, he saw in his mind a picture of
\par himself breaking away from the field (so to say) and coming rounding
\par into the home stretch to bear down on a grandstand wild with applause.
\par He bore about within him a subconscious premonition, as it were, which
\par apparently would not die, that something remarkable was to happen to him
\par sooner or later. An unpleasant circumstance was that it was getting
\par later now all the time. Still the estimate of his worth returned to him
\par by life did not rid him of the belief that he had been originally
\par intended by his Maker for higher things than he had found.
\par 
\par When, occasionally, the gloomy contrast of his life as it was with his
\par career as he conceived it had been meant to be depressed him too
\par untowardly, a young lady whom Keyes called Louise would administer
\par spiritual stimulants.
\par 
\par Louise was a very clever person, and she knew a superior young man when
\par she saw one. She did not care for your common men at all. She was
\par intellectual. She read everything, her friends said. She often told
\par Keyes that he ought to write. She knew, she declared, that he could
\par write better than most of the people who did write.
\par 
\par This idea of writing had, now and then, occurred to Keyes himself. He
\par was rather fond, in his odd hours, of reading periodical fiction, which
\par he liked to discuss with serious people like Louise. Sometimes with the
\par exhilaration occasioned by the reading of a particularly good story, a
\par romantic impulse to express himself welled up in him, and then
\par evaporated. Generally in these instances he wanted to write a kind of
\par story he had just read. He felt the glamour of the life of adventurous
\par tales. He thrilled in response to the note struck in that sort of
\par romance best exemplified, perhaps, in one of his favorites, "The Man Who
\par Would Be King." Or he longed to be like O. Henry, wise with the wisdom
\par of the Town. But there was one sort of story which always ignited in his
\par mind the thought that he really did know a story of his own. This he
\par sometimes positively yearned to tell. This the advertisement had put its
\par finger upon. "Every human life has one great story in it." It was even
\par so. "From your own heart history ..."--Benjamin Keyes felt that emotion
\par which is the conception of a work of art.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par He was pregnant with his idea. He rose from his bed betimes. He breathed
\par a strangely fragrant air. He looked at the beautiful world. He wrote. He
\par mentioned his little employment to no one: he felt rather ashamed of it,
\par in fact; but it infatuated him. He encountered some awful tough spots,
\par and at times he almost despaired--but he could not give up. Something
\par within him, which he himself was conscious he did not understand,
\par tortured him to go on. All day long, while at his business, his meals,
\par his shaving, his story turned and twisted and talked in the back of his
\par head. Despair alternated with exultation. At hours there came a gusto to
\par his work; words that he had heard or read, forgotten and never used,
\par came back to him from heaven knows where, and sprang to his pen at the
\par felicitous instance. He felt that his mind was more alert than he
\par remembered it to have ever been; he felt that his eyes were brighter;
\par his hands, his whole right arm, felt strong. He knew as he worked that
\par this was character, and this was sentiment, and this was humor. He was
\par shaken by the respiration of a heady drama. He felt that this--was
\par almost genius! And he was aghast that he had lived such a dull life
\par hitherto when this capacity had been in him.
\par 
\par He possessed little theoretic knowledge of writing; his story grew
\par naturally, like a tree: he was intelligent, and he had a story to tell
\par which must be told. In the matter of technical construction he followed
\par in a general way, intuitively, unconsciously for the most part, without
\par elaborate examination, the form of a short story as he was acquainted
\par with it through his reading of stories. He wandered alone at night,
\par oblivious of anything else, thinking, thinking his story over; and he
\par felt good in his brain and in his heart and in his stomach. He felt
\par virile, elated, full of power, and strangely happy. The joy of creating
\par a thing of art was upon him. Thrills ran down his spine and into his
\par legs; he would grin to himself in the dark streets; and sometimes he
\par laughed aloud. Everything else he neglected. He could not even read the
\par newspapers; he stayed at home two days from business; he worked early
\par and late, and walked up and down, throbbing, meantimes.
\par 
\par The story was almost finished. The story _was finished_. What would
\par Louise say? Would she think that he ought not to have written, ought not
\par to make public, so intimate a history? Then in the story he had carried
\par things further than they were in fact: the artistic instinct had
\par formally plighted the lovers' troth. He thought of submitting his
\par manuscript without showing it to Louise. Would it not be fine for her to
\par discover the story in print! But Keyes had to read that story to someone
\par or blow up.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par His evening with Louise began awkwardly. The pleasant interchange of
\par being did not, as usually so happily it did with Louise, flow naturally
\par along. Keyes was accustomed to feel that with Louise he talked better
\par than before anyone else. He now and then wished that certain other
\par people, upon whom he felt he had not made so favorable an impression as
\par he deserved, could overhear him sometime with Louise. Now, curiously,
\par with her he felt as he had with them: he could not somehow get his real
\par machinery started. Three or four times he determined to embark upon the
\par subject in his mind, and as many times the rising fulness in his chest
\par and the sudden quivering of his heart daunted him. As he looked now at
\par Louise, sitting there before him, the dignity of her as a young woman
\par struck him, and it occurred to him as extraordinary that he could have
\par been so intimate with her. He about concluded to put off his story until
\par another time, at which immediately he felt much relieved.
\par 
\par His gaze wandered about among the familiar objects of the little
\par parlor--the ordinary articles of the family furniture, the photographs
\par on the mantel, the hand-painted plate on the wall,--then rested upon the
\par framed Maxfield Parrish, which Keyes knew, with a glow of pride, to
\par express the superior refinement of Louise's own taste. Keyes shared
\par Louise's interest in art; he knew, and very much admired, the work of
\par Dulac, James Montgomery Flagg, N. C. Wyeth, Arthur Keller, and many
\par others; this was one of the fascinating bonds which united them, in
\par division from a frivolous, material, and unsympathetic world. He glanced
\par again now at the sumptuous Rackham book on the table, which it had been
\par such a delight to him to give her at Christmas; and the revived
\par discussion of \'e6sthetics led him fairly comfortably into the subject of
\par his own entrance into work in that field. His manuscript came out of
\par his pocket; and, straightening up on the edge of his chair, a little
\par nervous again in the still pause that ensued, he cleared his throat,
\par and, in a rather diffident voice, began to read. As he proceeded and
\par knew that his effort found favor, his want of confidence left him. He
\par fell into the swing and color of his work; and the heart of it he tasted
\par like fine wine as he read. In the more moving passages his voice shook a
\par trifle, and tears very nearly came into his eyes; it was all, he felt,
\par so beautiful. When he had concluded there was in Louise's eyes--as he
\par looked up, and saw her sitting, leaning forward with her chin on the
\par back of her hand, her elbow on her knee,--a strange light. It occurred
\par to Keyes that he did not remember ever to have seen a woman's face look
\par exactly that way before. Probably not. This was a light some men never
\par find on land or sea. It does not shine for any man more than once or
\par twice. They sat awhile, these two in the little parlor, and happiness
\par roared through their veins. Louise told Keyes that she had always known
\par that he "had it in him."
\par 
\par Then they arose, and they were near to each other, and their hearts
\par were filled, and beneath the chandelier he moved his arms about her. His
\par lips clasped hers. It was thus as it was in the story.
\par 
\par Keyes emerged from the brightly lighted doorway with Louise beaming
\par tenderly after him. In his blissful abstraction of mind he neglected, on
\par the dark porchway, to turn the corner of the house to the steps; but
\par walked instead, straight ahead, until the world gave way beneath him,
\par and he collapsed with a crash among the young vines.
\par 
\par The next week Louise, who held a position in the "Nickel's Weekly"
\par Circulation Branch office in the Middle West, neatly typed the
\par manuscript on one of the firm's machines. One evening they went together
\par to post the story.... The ancient, imperturbable moon observed this
\par momentous deed.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par When Keyes put that manuscript into the mail box, he _knew_ that it
\par would be accepted. He felt this in his bones. He felt it in the soles of
\par his feet and in the hair on his head.
\par 
\par For several days succeeding, a sensuous complacency pervaded young
\par Keyes. In a rich haze he saw himself acclaimed, famous, adored. His
\par nature was ardent, and he had always craved the warmth of approbation;
\par but he had not had it, except from Louise. Now there were moments when,
\par in a picture in his mind, he saw an attractive figure, which he
\par recognized as himself somewhat altered, come jauntily along, amiably
\par smiling, swinging a cane. He had always secretly desired very much to
\par carry a cane, but he had felt uncomfortably that the humbleness of his
\par position in life would make this ridiculous. In his moments of ambition
\par he had hoped, sometimes, that walking-sticks would not go out (to put it
\par so) before he came in. In the background of his mental picture Keyes
\par recognized among the doting multitude the faces of about all of his
\par acquaintances, some brought for the occasion from rather remote places.
\par 
\par Keyes felt a slight wrench of conscience in winking at this poetic
\par liberty taken with realistic probability. When a name occurred to him
\par the physiognomy of whose person was absent, Keyes's sense of probity was
\par smothered, with a slight twinge of pain, by the ardor of his
\par imagination; and place in the press was found for this person, very
\par kindly well up in front, where a good view could be had by him of the
\par celebrity--at this point the celebrity in the delectable vision was
\par observed gaily to light a cigarette. Discernible in the throng, too,
\par were some few whose mean and envious natures writhed, the psychologist
\par in Keyes perceived, at this handsome recognition of the worth of a young
\par man it had once been their wont to snub.
\par 
\par In this balmy temper of mind Keyes got down to business one morning a
\par little late. The humdrum of a business life had begun to be somewhat
\par more irksome than hitherto to Keyes's swelling spirit. He ruminated this
\par morning, as he stood before his tall stool at his ledger, on the curious
\par ill-adjustment of a universe so arranged that one of his capacity for
\par finer things could remain so unsuspected of the world about him, and the
\par rich value of his life to some unmeaning task-work be allowed to give. A
\par sudden electric buzzing beneath his high desk signalled him that his
\par presence was desired by his chief. "What now?" he thought, a little
\par tremulously and a little irritably, as he went: he had been caught up on
\par several slips lately. He paused respectfully in the private office
\par doorway. Mr. Winder, from his swivel-chair, flashed up his white
\par moustache very straight at Keyes. "Sit down," he directed. The suavity
\par which was his habit was quite absent. Keyes felt the presence in the air
\par of a good deal of masculine firmness.
\par 
\par "This," said Mr. Winder, his eye steadily on Keyes, "is a place of
\par business. It is not a gentleman's club. Now, I want you to take a brace.
\par That will do."
\par 
\par As Keyes took up his pen again and began to write, "By merchandise," his
\par breast was full with resentment: a sense of the real integrity of his
\par nature welled up in him. His mind rapidly generated the divers manly
\par replies he wished, with an intensity amounting to pain, he had thought
\par of a moment before. He saw himself, now exasperatingly too late, saying
\par with frank honesty to Mr. Winder:
\par 
\par "I realize that I have of late been a little delinquent. But (with some
\par eloquence) it has always been my intention to be, and I believe in the
\par main I have been, a faithful and conscientious employee. I shall not be
\par found wanting again."
\par 
\par But here he was a rebuked culprit. He felt the degradation of servitude.
\par He experienced sharply that violent yearning so familiar to all that
\par are employed everywhere, to be able to go in and tell Mr. Winder to go
\par to the devil. And though he felt at bottom the legitimacy, in the
\par business ethic, of Mr. Winder's attitude, he also felt forlornly the
\par coldness of the business relation, the brutal authority of worldly
\par power, and its conception of his insignificance. And he was stung at the
\par moral criminality, as he felt it to be, of a situation which placed such
\par a man as Mr. Winder over such a nature as his own; Mr. Winder he did not
\par suppose had read a book within the last ten years.
\par 
\par As, at that hour which sets the weary toiler free, in the gathering dusk
\par Keyes stood on the curb amid the hurrying throng homeward bound,--oh!
\par how he longed for that establishment in the eyes of men which the
\par success of his story would bring him. Oh, when would he hear! As he
\par bowled along in the crowded trolley the thought stole through him, until
\par it amounted almost to a conviction, that the great letter awaited him at
\par home now. He could hardly bear the tedium of the short journey.
\par Restlessly he turned his evening paper.
\par 
\par In him had developed of late a great interest in authors; he peered
\par between the pages, a little sheepishly, at the column, "Books and Their
\par Makers." He read that Mr. So and So, the author of "This and That," was
\par a young man thirty years of age. Instantly he reflected that he himself
\par was but twenty-seven. This was encouraging! He had formed a habit
\par recently of contrasting at once any writer's age with his own. If he
\par learned that Mr. Galsworthy, whose books were much advertised but which
\par he had not read, was forty-something, he wanted to know how old he had
\par been when he wrote his first book. Then he counted up the number of
\par books between that time--comparing his age at that time with his
\par own--and now. He was absorbed in the literary gossip of the day. That
\par Myra Kelly had been a schoolteacher, that Gertrude Atherton lived in
\par California, that Mr. Bennett had turned thirty before he published his
\par first book, that such a writer was in Rome, or that some other one was
\par engaged on a new work said to be about the Russian Jews,--he found very
\par interesting. He read in his newspaper the publishers' declaration that
\par Maurice Hewlett's new creation recalled Don Quixote, Cyrano, d'Artagnan,
\par Falstaff, Bombastes Furioso, Tartarin, Gil Blas. His notions concerning
\par the characters of this company were somewhat vague; but he was stirred
\par with an ambition to create some such character, too.
\par 
\par On leaving the car whom should he see but Dr. Nevens. They walked along
\par together. Dr. Nevens inquired about the business. A bad year, he
\par surmised, for trade. Trade! Keyes felt his heart thumping with the
\par temptation to confide the adventures of his literary life; which,
\par indeed, he had found exceedingly difficult to keep so much to himself.
\par But his position gave him clairvoyance: he divined that no sort of
\par ambition receives from people in general so little respect, by some
\par curious idiosyncrasy of the human mind, as literary aspiration. With
\par what coarse and withering scorn had an intimation--which had escaped
\par him--that he had sought to give some artistic articulation to his ideas
\par been met by Pimpkins the other day at the office!
\par 
\par The personality of Dr. Nevens, however, suggested a more sympathetic
\par attitude, by reason of the dentist's cultivation. Dr. Nevens was spoken
\par of as a "booklover." He had a "library"--it was, he implied, his
\par bachelor foible--the cornerstone of which was a set of the Thistle
\par edition of Stevenson that he had bought by subscription from an agent.
\par (Keyes had thought it odd one day that Dr. Nevens had not cut the
\par leaves.) And "the doctor" was fond of speaking familiarly of Dickens,
\par and gained much admiration by his often saying that he should like--had
\par he time--to read through "Esmond" once every year. Here, Keyes felt,
\par would be spiritual succor.
\par 
\par But Keyes quickly learned that he was quite in a different case from the
\par author of "Esmond." Dr. Nevens was kind, but pitying.
\par 
\par "Only one out of hundreds, thousands," he said, "ever comes to
\par anything."
\par 
\par It did not occur to him, Keyes thought, as within the range of remotest
\par possibility that he, Keyes, _might_ be one of these. Then came the
\par doctor's reason.
\par 
\par "You do not know anything," he said paternally, "anything at all."
\par 
\par Keyes realized, with some bitterness, that this world is not an
\par institution existing for the purpose of detecting and rewarding inner
\par worth. He had known enough to write his story, he guessed. With some
\par flare of rage, he felt that simply unsupported merit is rather frowned
\par upon, as tending by comparison to cast others possibly not possessing so
\par much of it somewhat into the shade. He had a savage thought that when
\par he was Dr. Nevens's age he would not be a country dentist. He saw the
\par intense egoism of mankind.
\par 
\par Dr. Nevens was determined to show a young man who had betrayed a
\par consciousness of superiority of grain, his place--economically and
\par socially. The selfish jealousy of the world!

\par 
\par His letter had not come. There was only a package from Louise--a copy of
\par "Book Talk," containing a marked article on "Representative American
\par Story Tellers"; from this, after dinner, Keyes imbibed most of the
\par purported facts about Booth Tarkington. Then he went to bed to sleep
\par through the hours until the return of the postman.
\par 
\par The next evening still there was no letter. Keyes's spirit was troubled.
\par He sought the solace of solitude in the quiet, shadowed streets. A
\par reaction was succeeding his rosy complacency! Doubts pierced his
\par dissolving confidence. Was his story so good, after all? Somehow, as he
\par looked back at it now, it seemed much less strong than it had before. He
\par felt a sort of sinking in his stomach. A sickening suspicion came to
\par him that, perhaps, it was absurd. Maybe it was very silly. In a
\par disconnected way certain remarks and passages in it came back to him now
\par as quite questionable. Yes, they sounded pretty maudlin. He squirmed
\par within with mortification as a recollection of these passages passed
\par through his mind. He hoped his story would never get into print. A fear
\par that it might nauseated him. Then he was suffused with a sensation of
\par how little he amounted to. He felt, with a sense of great weakness, the
\par precariousness of his job. A horror came over him that he might lose it.
\par He wished he did not know Louise, who expected things of him. He felt
\par how awkward it was so to fail her. In the position he had got himself
\par into with her, how he had laid himself open to humiliating exposure! Oh,
\par why had he ever sought her? He wished he did not know anybody well. He
\par was an ass and he would never come to anything. He felt the futility of
\par his life. Why could he not slink away somewhere and live out his feeble
\par existence unobserved? As he got into bed he felt that very easily he
\par could cry.

\par 
\par ... Keyes stood before a downtown news-stand. Hurrying pedestrians
\par bumped into him. An irascible character or two, thus impeded, glared
\par back at him--what was the matter with the fellow! Did he think there was
\par nobody but himself in the world?
\par 
\par B. C. Keyes walked home to the sound of a great orchestra reverberating
\par through him. He could not tolerate the thought of subduing himself to
\par the confinement of a car. He needed movement and air.
\par 
\par It had come, his great letter, a few weeks before. At his sitting down
\par to dinner his mother had given him the envelope. _The Favorite
\par Magazine_--these words had seemed to him to be printed in the upper
\par left-hand corner; it had struck him that perhaps the strain on his
\par nerves of late had so deranged his mind that he now saw, as in a
\par mirage, what was not. "Benjamin C. Keyes, Esq."--so ran the address.
\par Keyes in his dizziness noted this point: people had not customarily
\par addressed him as _esquire_. Then, for the first time in his life, he
\par held in his hand a substantial check payable to his own name--wealth!
\par Courteous and laudatory typewritten words danced before his burning
\par eyes.
\par 
\par He felt, though in a degree an hundred times intensified, as though he
\par had smoked so much tobacco, and drunk so much coffee, he could not
\par compose himself to eat, or read a paper, or go to bed, or stay where he
\par was; but must rush off somewhere else and talk hysterically. He got
\par through his meal blindly. He could not explain--just yet--to his mother:
\par he felt he could not control the patience necessary to begin at the
\par beginning and construct a coherent narrative.... He must go to Louise
\par who already understood the preliminary situation.
\par 
\par It had occurred to Keyes on his hurried, stumbling way thither that the
\par whole thing was unbelievable, and that he must be quite insane. After he
\par had pushed the bell, an interminable time seemed to elapse before his
\par ring was answered. As he stood there on the porch he felt his flesh
\par palpitating. A terrible fear came over him that Louise might not be at
\par home.... Louise said, when her frenzy had somewhat abated, that she had
\par always known that he "had it in him." She told him there was now "a
\par future" before him.... Keyes had determined to go on about his business
\par as though nothing unusual had occurred; then when the story appeared, to
\par accept congratulations with retiring modesty. Before noon the next day
\par he had told three people; by night, seven.
\par 
\par So, going over it all again, Keyes arrived at home, to learn that--"What
\par do you think?" His mother said "a reporter" had been at the house; an
\par occurrence--quite unprecedented in Mrs. Keyes's experience--which had
\par thrown her into considerable agitation. This public official she had
\par associated in her confusion with a policeman. He had, however, treated
\par her as a personage of great interest. He told her "there was nothing to
\par be ashamed of." He drew from her trembling lips some account of her
\par son's life, and requested a photograph.
\par 
\par Next day the dean of local newspapers, vigilant in patriotism, printed
\par an extended article on the "state's new writer." And in an editorial
\par entitled "The Modern Athens" (which referred to Keyes only by
\par implication) the paper affirmed again that Andiena was "by general
\par consent the present chief centre of letters in America." It
\par recapitulated the names of those of her sons and daughters whose works
\par were on the counters of every department store in the land. It concluded
\par by saying: "The hope of a people is in its writers, its chosen ones of
\par lofty thought, its poets and prophets, who shall dream and sing for it,
\par who shall gather up its tendencies and formulate its ideals and voice
\par its spirit, proclaiming its duties and awakening its enthusiasm." Keyes
\par read this, as he took it to be, moving and eloquent tribute to his prize
\par story with feelings akin to those experienced, very probably, by Isaiah.
\par 
\par Keyes received an ovation at "the office." The humility of Pimpkins's
\par admiration was abject. Keyes perceived the commanding quality of
\par ambition--when successful. Miss Wimble, the hollow-breasted cashieress,
\par regarded him with sheep's-eyes. Even Mr. Winder, in passing,
\par congratulated him upon his "stroke of luck."
\par 
\par Wonders once begun, it seemed, poured. Two letters awaited him that
\par evening. One from the editor of _The Monocle Magazine_. _The Monocle
\par Magazine_, as Louis said, "think of it!" The editor of this
\par distinguished institution spoke of his "pleasure" in reading Mr. Keyes's
\par "compelling" story; he begged to request the favor of the "offer" of
\par some of Keyes's "other work." By way of a fraternal insinuation he
\par mentioned that he was a native of Andiena, himself. "Most of us are,"
\par was his sportive comment. The "Consolidated Sunday Magazines, Inc.,"
\par wrote with much business directness to solicit "manuscript," at
\par "immediate payment on acceptance at your regular rates for fiction of
\par the first class."
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par The extraordinary turn of events in Keyes's life brought him visitors as
\par well as letters. Dr. Nevens called, benignly smiling appreciation. His
\par impression appeared to be that he had not been mistaken in giving Keyes
\par his support. Of more constructive importance, however, was the turning
\par up of Mr. Tate, who had been Keyes's instructor in "English" at the
\par Longridge High School. A slender, pale, young man, with a bald, domed
\par forehead "rising in its white mass like a tower of mind," Mr. Tate was
\par understood to nourish a deep respect for literature. He had contributed
\par one or two very serious and painstaking "papers" on the English of
\par Chaucer (not very well understood by Keyes at the time), to "Poet-Lore";
\par and had edited, with notes, several "texts"--one of "The Lady of the
\par Lake," with an "introduction," for school use. He reverenced, he now
\par made evident, the "creative gift," as he designated it; which, he
\par realized, had been denied him. He had come to pay homage to a vessel of
\par this gift, his former pupil, now illustrious.
\par 
\par With the hand of destiny Mr. Tate touched a vital chord. Self-assertion;
\par to be no longer an unregarded atom in the mass of those born only to
\par labor for others; to find play for the mind and the passion which, by no
\par choice of his own, distinguished him from the time slave: this was now
\par Keyes's smouldering thought. Mr. Tate, from his conversancy with the
\par literary situation, reported that there never was in the history of the
\par world such a demand for fiction as now, and that "the publishers"
\par declared there was not an overproduction of good fiction. Editors, Mr.
\par Tate said, were eager to welcome new talent. He strongly encouraged
\par Keyes to adopt what he spoke of as the "literary life." In fact, he
\par seemed to consider that there was no alternative. And, indeed, already
\par in Keyes's own idea of his future he saw himself eventually settled
\par somewhere amid the Irvin-Cobbs, the Julian-Streets, the
\par Joseph-Hergesheimers, and other clever people whose society would be
\par congenial to him.
\par 
\par For the present he cultivated his ego, as became a literary light; and
\par now, with Mr. Tate's assistance, he began to devote the time at his
\par command to preparation for his life's work, to study. Mr. Tate was
\par ardent to be of service; he felt that he had here connected himself with
\par literary history in the making. The great need for Keyes, he felt, was
\par education. The creative genius, Mr. Tate said, could not be implanted;
\par but he felt that this other he could supply. He recommended the patient
\par study of men and books. He thought that what Keyes needed in especial
\par was "technical" knowledge; so he went at that strong. Maupassant, Mr.
\par Tate said, was the great master of the short story. Keyes began his
\par evening studies in English translations of Maupassant.
\par 
\par The galling yoke of his business life was becoming well-nigh unbearable.
\par His soul was in ferment. If only he did not have to get up to hurry
\par every morning down to that penitentiary, there to waste his days, he
\par could get something done. That sapped his vitals. And he was tortured by
\par a flame--to do, to read, study, create, grow, accomplish! He was
\par expanding against the walls of his environment. God! could he but burst
\par them asunder, and leap out!
\par 
\par Mr. Tate had a high idea of a thing which he spoke of as "style." In
\par elucidation of this theme he suggested perusal of essays and treatises
\par by DeQuincey, Walter Pater, and Professor Raleigh, He felt also that the
\par "art of fiction" should be mastered by his prot\'e9g\'e9. So Keyes pitched
\par into examinations of this recondite subject by Sir Walter Besant, Marion
\par Crawford, R. L. Stevenson, and Anthony Trollope. Keyes realized that he
\par had _not_ realized before what a lot there was _to_ writing. Mr. Tate
\par purchased out of his slender means as a present, "Success in
\par Literature," by G. H. Lewes. He unearthed a rich collection in titles of
\par books the consumption of which literature would be invaluable to one in
\par training for the literary profession. An admirable bibliography, this
\par list, of the genre which was Keyes's specialty:--"The Art of Short
\par Story Writing," "Practical Short Story Writing," "The Art of the Short
\par Story," "The Short Story," "Book of the Short Story," "How to Write a
\par Short Story," "Writing of the Short Story," "Short Story Writing,"
\par "Philosophy of the Short Story," "The Story-Teller's Art," "The Short
\par Story in English," "Selections from the World's Greatest Short Stories,"
\par "American Short Stories," "Great English Short-Story Writers." In the
\par reading room of the public library Keyes followed a series of articles
\par in "Book Talk" on the "Craftsmanship of Writing." He advanced in
\par literary culture, under Mr. Tate's zealous lead, to consideration of
\par "the novel," its history and development. And, too, to the drama, its
\par law and technique. His head was filled with the theory of d\'e9nouements,
\par "moments," rising actions, climaxes, suspended actions, and
\par catastrophes. At times he had an uneasy feeling that all these things
\par did not much help him to think up any new stories of his own. But Mr.
\par Tate said "that" would "come."
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par And wealth and fame were even now at hand. The promoters of the great
\par prize contest advertising dodge had not been at fault in business
\par acumen; the winning story returned ample evidence of its popular appeal.
\par It was akin to the minds of the "peepul." _The Favorite Magazine_ was
\par sold during August by enterprising newsboys _on trolley cars_. That
\par great public whose literature is exclusively contemporaneous,--whose
\par world of letters is the current _Saturday Mail-Coach_, the _All-people's
\par Magazine_, the _Purple Book_, the _Nothing-But-Stories_, the _Modiste,
\par The Swift Set, Jones's--the Magazine that Entertains, Brisk Stories,
\par Popularity_, and the _Tip-Top_,--discussed the big features on front
\par porches. Keyes's story even attracted the interest of those _who seldom
\par read anything_. A number of letters from persons of that impulsive class
\par which communicates its inward feelings to authors personally unknown
\par were forwarded to Keyes from his publishers. A young lady resident in
\par St. Joe, Michigan, wrote to say that she thought the scene where the
\par boat upsets was the "_grandest thing_ ever written."
\par 
\par Imagine a man like Keyes sitting his days away on an office stool. His
\par mother, however, could not "see" his resigning his position. His
\par "father had always" ... and so forth. Keyes foamed within. What a
\par thing--woman's maddening narrowness! At the office Keyes's situation
\par grew, in subtle ways, more and more oppressive. His position appeared to
\par become equivocal. Mr. Winder seemed to make a point of increasing
\par exactness. Keyes felt a disposition in authority to put down any
\par subordinate uppishness of feeling possibly occasioned by doings outside
\par the line of business. And he became conscious, too, of a curious
\par estrangement from his associates there. They, on their side, Pimpkins in
\par especial, seemed to feel that he felt he was too good for them. And, in
\par truth, he did. The mundane aims of those around him got on his nerves.
\par Their commonplace thoughts irritated him. They were _common_ natures.
\par But, with fierce secret joy, Keyes knew that an event was approaching
\par which promised, would command, deliverance from it all.
\par 
\par Fall came. And the Favorite Publishing Company bound up the prize story
\par as a "gift book" for the holiday trade. Claud Clarence Chamberlain, the
\par well-known illustrator and creator of the famous "Picture-Hat Girl," was
\par commissioned to make the decorations. These were done with much dash in
\par highly colored crayon and popular sentiment. One was printed on the
\par paper jacket of the book, with the title in embossed letters. The
\par advertisement pronounced the work altogether "an exquisite piece of
\par book-making." It declared the production the "daintiest gift of the
\par season," and reminded "people of culture and refinement" that there was
\par "no present like a book."
\par 
\par Indeed a hero is not without fame in his own country. The
\par Stanton-Merritt bookstore on Capital Street arranged a window display of
\par about a ton of "Will Rockwell Makes Good," with one of Mr. Chamberlain's
\par original illustrations, framed, in the centre. A monster advertising
\par banner was flung across the front of the store above the entrance and
\par windows. Just inside, a pyramid breast-high was built of the books,
\par beneath an artistic piece of work--a hanging board upon which was burned
\par in old English letters: "'A good book is the precious life blood of a
\par Master Spirit'--Milton." A lady who informed the salesman that she
\par thought "books" were "just fine," bought twenty copies for holiday
\par distribution. She inquired if there was not a discount on that number
\par purchased.
\par 
\par Drugged with triumph, they returned together Saturday night from the
\par exhibition "down town"; and, in the now historic little parlor again,
\par Louise wept upon the shoulder of her affianced. Yes; they were formally
\par engaged. Keyes was not without a sensation that the situation was rather
\par chaotic. But destiny seemed to close in on him and bear him on.
\par 
\par The reviewers got on the job. And they were there with the goods.
\par Statements from a few typical press notices follow. "An absorbing
\par story," said the Topeka _Progressive_, "throbbing with optimism." "Mr.
\par Keyes strikes a new note in this unusual production; vivid,
\par dramatic,"--San Francisco _Lookout_. "A story of vivid and compelling
\par interest," one critic declared. "A delightful story, rich in heart
\par throbs," was one good one. One reviewer said, "Here we have a real love
\par story, a tale of love, tender and true, delightfully narrated. There are
\par so many fine, tender passages in the episode of these two, who live just
\par for each other, that reading the little book is like breathing strong,
\par refreshing air." "The creator of 'Will Rockwell," said one paper, "has
\par here written a new idyl of America." "An inspiring picture," said
\par another. One very fine critique said: "Once in awhile, possibly once in
\par a lifetime, there arises before us a writer of fiction whose genius is
\par undeniable the instant it greets us." When Keyes read this, quoted in
\par his publisher's latest newspaper advertisement, he knew that he had
\par found his work in the world. And reasoning from his experience, he saw
\par before him a calling that would be ever a noble intoxication of the
\par soul, a kind that would know naught of headaches or remorse.
\par 
\par But perhaps the best of all the critical dicta was this: "Written," it
\par declared, "with blood and tears and fire." Very impressive was the
\par number of times that were used such adjectives as "big," "vital,"
\par "absorbing," "compelling," "remarkable," "insistent," and "virile."
\par "Optimism," it developed too, was the supreme merit of fiction. One of
\par the arresting terms employed was "economy of means."
\par 
\par There were, it is true, a few dissenting voices from the chorus of
\par unrestrained praise, chiefly from certain notoriously dull,
\par conservative, killjoy journals. The New York _Evening Postman_ said:
\par "This somewhat amateurish little essay in fiction seems to be the
\par product of an untutored sincerity. In this, its sincerity, it is not
\par without a degree of vigor. We doubt, however, whether the author can
\par repeat the performance." And that irrepressibly ribald organ, the New
\par York _Beam_, could not forbear its customary jocular sport. Its smart
\par review of this little classic (as one bookseller already pronounced it)
\par began: "Hooray for 'Will'! Hooray also for 'Mabel'! They are the real
\par simegoozlia."
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par "Don't you think you could write something now, dear?" inquired Mrs.
\par Keyes, who did not see how scholarship pure and simple was, so to say,
\par to move the boat.
\par 
\par This idea of writing something now had indeed occurred to Keyes; but
\par somehow he had not been able to think of anything in particular to
\par write. So he went on with his studies, at the same time keeping an eye
\par open for available material, characters, and plots.
\par 
\par "Surely you can write something, Ben, that we could get some money for,"
\par said Louise. A wife, after all, is only a woman, with a mind fitted to
\par petty things, such as groceries, family washings, clothing, and divers
\par household bills. It is irritating to a man of lofty mind who night and
\par day is racking his brain for an idea, to be prodded on in this fashion.
\par Keyes ground his teeth and bore it; he reflected that an author's life
\par is frequently a battle with mediocrity. Perhaps he was mistaken as to
\par where lay the mediocrity with which he battled.
\par 
\par He fretted and worried and at length sat himself down to write without
\par an inspiration. He bethought himself of Trollope's example to literary
\par aspirants, and tried to grind out two hundred and fifty words every
\par fifteen minutes for three hours a day. He couldn't write twenty. He kept
\par doggedly on. He could not make his characters act or talk--the talk was
\par the most hopeless thing of all. He couldn't, as once he had done, cry
\par over them. Sometimes, in the stillness of the night with his clock
\par ticking before him, he almost thought that he had regained for a moment
\par a tithe of the power he once had; but in the morning when he reviewed
\par his work he admitted that he had been sadly mistaken. Now doubts haunted
\par his soul; even as he wrote another consciousness within not thus
\par employed whispered of his impotency. Fact is, Keyes had not at all the
\par creative gift.
\par 
\par He struggled through a number of stories, some better and some worse.
\par When he mailed these it was with a faltering, doubting heart. Something
\par with a weak action away in his interior told him that they would not be
\par accepted.
\par 
\par Keyes got thinner in flesh, more distressed in spirit, and poorer in
\par this world's goods as time went on. Sometimes he felt like an imposter
\par and was ashamed to face his wife; then he reread his press notices and a
\par fever to do something shook him. But a man cannot support himself and
\par his wife on a fever to do something. Benjamin Cecil Keyes could not
\par understand the thing: if he had literary genius why couldn't he write?
\par If he had not, how then had he written? To sit in full view of one's
\par wife day after day pretending to be interested in a book when the
\par bill-collector calls; and to be tormented all the time by a desire to do
\par something and not to be able to do it, or know when, if ever, one will
\par be able; and to be ashamed and afraid to tell one's wife this; but to be
\par compelled to be there, or to run away, or to hang one's self--this is a
\par situation more than uncomfortable.
\par 
\par A thousand times Keyes decided to roll up his sleeves and do something
\par else--engage in any profitable employment; and a thousand times he
\par decided not to--just yet. A man often exists in this way until he gets
\par quite to the end of the string where the wolf is.
\par 
\par "That was an accident, Louise," said Keyes sadly one day. "I find I
\par can't write."
\par 
\par Keyes was mistaken again. No fine thing ever was made by accident. Keyes
\par managed to write that story because its theme was the most interesting
\par incident in his life; because it appealed to him more strongly than
\par anything else had in his whole experience; because he was thoroughly
\par familiar with the life and the people he featured in his story; because
\par he was absolutely sincere in his sympathies, appreciation, and emotions
\par here; he had no ideals set way beyond his power, no aping tendencies
\par after an effective style, no attention distracted by an ill-digested
\par knowledge of mechanical construction. The structure, and the style
\par simply came, probably because--and finally he managed to write that
\par story because--he was keyed up to it.
\par 
\par A domestic woman often has a wretchedly unworshipful view of art and
\par fame. Keyes's confession did not kill Louise. I suppose he expected her
\par to go back to her parents in high dudgeon as one who had been grossly
\par swindled.
\par 
\par "Do you care if you can't write?" she said, after a moment's silence.
\par "Just think how nice you are--how much nicer you were before you tried
\par to write! And how it has worried you!"
\par 
\par Keyes got a job as a collector for a mercantile house. "My health
\par demands outdoor employment," he told his acquaintances.
\par 
\par        *       *       *       *       *
\par 
\par Sometimes, alone with his lamp after the day's confounded drudgery,
\par Keyes got out the old magazine and reread his forgotten story.

\par 
\par The Forethought
\par 
\par Herein lie buried many things which if read with patience may show the
\par strange meaning of being black here at the dawning of the Twentieth
\par Century.  This meaning is not without interest to you, Gentle Reader;
\par for the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color
\par line.  I pray you, then, receive my little book in all charity,
\par studying my words with me, forgiving mistake and foible for sake of the
\par faith and passion that is in me, and seeking the grain of truth hidden
\par there.
\par 
\par I have sought here to sketch, in vague, uncertain outline, the
\par spiritual world in which ten thousand thousand Americans live and
\par strive.  First, in two chapters I have tried to show what Emancipation
\par meant to them, and what was its aftermath.  In a third chapter I have
\par pointed out the slow rise of personal leadership, and criticized
\par candidly the leader who bears the chief burden of his race to-day.
\par Then, in two other chapters I have sketched in swift outline the two
\par worlds within and without the Veil, and thus have come to the central
\par problem of training men for life.  Venturing now into deeper detail, I
\par have in two chapters studied the struggles of the massed millions of
\par the black peasantry, and in another have sought to make clear the
\par present relations of the sons of master and man.  Leaving, then, the
\par white world, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may
\par view faintly its deeper recesses,--the meaning of its religion, the
\par passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls.
\par All this I have ended with a tale twice told but seldom written, and a
\par chapter of song.
\par 
\par Some of these thoughts of mine have seen the light before in other
\par guise.  For kindly consenting to their republication here, in altered
\par and extended form, I must thank the publishers of the Atlantic Monthly,
\par The World's Work, the Dial, The New World, and the Annals of the
\par American Academy of Political and Social Science.  Before each chapter,
\par as now printed, stands a bar of the Sorrow Songs,--some echo of
\par haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black
\par souls in the dark past.  And, finally, need I add that I who speak here
\par am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the
\par Veil?

\par     Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail,
\par   And the fire of the end begin to burn in the west;

\par     All life long crying without avail,
\par       As the water all night long is crying to me.

\par   ARTHUR SYMONS.
\par 
\par 
\par Between me and the other world there is ever an unasked question:
\par unasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the
\par difficulty of rightly framing it.  All, nevertheless, flutter round it.
\par They approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or
\par compassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, How does it feel
\par to be a problem?  they say, I know an excellent colored man in my town;
\par or, I fought at Mechanicsville; or, Do not these Southern outrages make
\par your blood boil?  At these I smile, or am interested, or reduce the
\par boiling to a simmer, as the occasion may require.  To the real
\par question, How does it feel to be a problem?  I answer seldom a word.
\par 
\par And yet, being a problem is a strange experience,--peculiar even for
\par one who has never been anything else, save perhaps in babyhood and in
\par Europe.  It is in the early days of rollicking boyhood that the
\par revelation first bursts upon one, all in a day, as it were.  I remember
\par well when the shadow swept across me. I was a little thing, away up in
\par the hills of New England, where the dark Housatonic winds between
\par Hoosac and Taghkanic to the sea.  In a wee wooden schoolhouse,
\par something put it into the boys' and girls' heads to buy gorgeous
\par visiting-cards--ten cents a package--and exchange.  The exchange was
\par merry, till one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card,--refused it
\par peremptorily, with a glance.  Then it dawned upon me with a certain
\par suddenness that I was different from the others; or like, mayhap, in
\par heart and life and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast
\par veil.  I had thereafter no desire to tear down that veil, to creep
\par through; I held all beyond it in common contempt, and lived above it in
\par a region of blue sky and great wandering shadows.  That sky was bluest
\par when I could beat my mates at examination-time, or beat them at a
\par foot-race, or even beat their stringy heads.  Alas, with the years all
\par this fine contempt began to fade; for the words I longed for, and all
\par their dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine.  But they should
\par not keep these prizes, I said; some, all, I would wrest from them.
\par Just how I would do it I could never decide: by reading law, by healing
\par the sick, by telling the wonderful tales that swam in my head,--some
\par way.  With other black boys the strife was not so fiercely sunny: their
\par youth shrunk into tasteless sycophancy, or into silent hatred of the
\par pale world about them and mocking distrust of everything white; or
\par wasted itself in a bitter cry, Why did God make me an outcast and a
\par stranger in mine own house?  The shades of the prison-house closed
\par round about us all: walls strait and stubborn to the whitest, but
\par relentlessly narrow, tall, and unscalable to sons of night who must
\par plod darkly on in resignation, or beat unavailing palms against the
\par stone, or steadily, half hopelessly, watch the streak of blue above.
\par 
\par After the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and
\par Mongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and
\par gifted with second-sight in this American world,--a world which yields
\par him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through
\par the revelation of the other world.  It is a peculiar sensation, this
\par double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self
\par through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a
\par world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.  One ever feels his
\par twoness,--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two
\par unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose
\par dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.
\par 
\par The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,--this
\par longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into
\par a better and truer self.  In this merging he wishes neither of the
\par older selves to be lost.  He would not Africanize America, for America
\par has too much to teach the world and Africa.  He would not bleach his
\par Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro
\par blood has a message for the world.  He simply wishes to make it
\par possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being
\par cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of
\par Opportunity closed roughly in his face.
\par 
\par This, then, is the end of his striving: to be a co-worker in the
\par kingdom of culture, to escape both death and isolation, to husband and
\par use his best powers and his latent genius.  These powers of body and
\par mind have in the past been strangely wasted, dispersed, or forgotten.
\par The shadow of a mighty Negro past flits through the tale of Ethiopia
\par the Shadowy and of Egypt the Sphinx.  Through history, the powers of
\par single black men flash here and there like falling stars, and die
\par sometimes before the world has rightly gauged their brightness.  Here
\par in America, in the few days since Emancipation, the black man's turning
\par hither and thither in hesitant and doubtful striving has often made his
\par very strength to lose effectiveness, to seem like absence of power,
\par like weakness.  And yet it is not weakness,--it is the contradiction of
\par double aims.  The double-aimed struggle of the black artisan--on the
\par one hand to escape white contempt for a nation of  mere hewers of wood
\par and drawers of water, and on the other hand to plough and nail and dig
\par for a poverty-stricken horde--could only result in making him a poor
\par craftsman, for he had but half a heart in either cause.  By the poverty
\par and ignorance of his people, the Negro minister or doctor was tempted
\par toward quackery and demagogy; and by the criticism of the other world,
\par toward ideals that made him ashamed of his lowly tasks.  The would-be
\par black savant was confronted by the paradox that the knowledge his
\par people needed was a twice-told tale to his white neighbors, while the
\par knowledge which would teach the white world was Greek to his own flesh
\par and blood.  The innate love of harmony and beauty that set the ruder
\par souls of his people a-dancing and a-singing raised but confusion and
\par doubt in the soul of the black artist; for the beauty revealed to him
\par was the soul-beauty of a race which his larger audience despised, and
\par he could not articulate the message of another people.  This waste of
\par double aims, this seeking to satisfy two unreconciled ideals, has
\par wrought sad havoc with the courage and faith and deeds of ten thousand
\par thousand people,--has sent them often wooing false gods and invoking
\par false means of salvation, and at times has even seemed about to make
\par them ashamed of themselves.
\par 
\par Away back in the days of bondage they thought to see in one divine
\par event the end of all doubt and disappointment; few men ever worshipped
\par Freedom with half such unquestioning faith as did the American Negro
\par for two centuries.  To him, so far as he thought and dreamed, slavery
\par was indeed the sum of all villainies, the cause of all sorrow, the root
\par of all prejudice; Emancipation was the key to a promised land of
\par sweeter beauty than ever stretched before the eyes of wearied
\par Israelites.  In song and exhortation swelled one refrain--Liberty; in
\par his tears and curses the God he implored had Freedom in his right hand.
\par At last it came,--suddenly, fearfully, like a dream.  With one wild
\par carnival of blood and passion came the message in his own plaintive
\par cadences:--
\par 
\par   "Shout, O children!
\par   Shout, you're free!
\par   For God has bought your liberty!"
\par 
\par 
\par Years have passed away since then,--ten, twenty, forty; forty years of
\par national life, forty years of renewal and development, and yet the
\par swarthy spectre sits in its accustomed seat at the Nation's feast.  In
\par vain do we cry to this our vastest social problem:--
\par 
\par   "Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
\par   Shall never tremble!"
\par 
\par 
\par The Nation has not yet found peace from its sins; the freedman has not
\par yet found in freedom his promised land.  Whatever of good may have come
\par in these years of change, the shadow of a deep disappointment rests
\par upon the Negro people,--a disappointment all the more bitter because
\par the unattained ideal was unbounded save by the simple ignorance of a
\par lowly people.
\par 
\par The first decade was merely a prolongation of the vain search for
\par freedom, the boon that seemed ever barely to elude their grasp,--like a
\par tantalizing will-o'-the-wisp, maddening and misleading the headless
\par host.  The holocaust of war, the terrors of the Ku-Klux Klan, the lies
\par of carpet-baggers, the disorganization of industry, and the
\par contradictory advice of friends and foes, left the bewildered serf with
\par no new watchword beyond the old cry for freedom.  As the time flew,
\par however, he began to grasp a new idea.  The ideal of liberty demanded
\par for its attainment powerful means, and these the Fifteenth Amendment
\par gave him.  The ballot, which before he had looked upon as a visible
\par sign of freedom, he now regarded as the chief means of gaining and
\par perfecting the liberty with which war had partially endowed him.  And
\par why not?  Had not votes made war and emancipated millions?  Had not
\par votes enfranchised the freedmen?  Was anything impossible to a power
\par that had done all this?  A million black men started with renewed zeal
\par to vote themselves into the kingdom.  So the decade flew away, the
\par revolution of 1876 came, and left the half-free serf weary, wondering,
\par but still inspired.  Slowly but steadily, in the following years, a new
\par vision began gradually to replace the dream of political power,--a
\par powerful movement, the rise of another ideal to guide the unguided,
\par another pillar of fire by night after a clouded day.  It was the ideal
\par of "book-learning"; the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to
\par know and test the power of the cabalistic letters of the white man, the
\par longing to know.  Here at last seemed to have been discovered the
\par mountain path to Canaan; longer than the highway of Emancipation and
\par law, steep and rugged, but straight, leading to heights high enough to
\par overlook life.
\par 
\par Up the new path the advance guard toiled, slowly, heavily, doggedly;
\par only those who have watched and guided the faltering feet, the misty
\par minds, the dull understandings, of the dark pupils of these schools
\par know how faithfully, how piteously, this people strove to learn.  It
\par was weary work.  The cold statistician wrote down the inches of
\par progress here and there, noted also where here and there a foot had
\par slipped or some one had fallen.  To the tired climbers, the horizon was
\par ever dark, the mists were often cold, the Canaan was always dim and far
\par away.  If, however, the vistas disclosed as yet no goal, no
\par resting-place, little but flattery and criticism, the journey at least
\par gave leisure for reflection and self-examination; it changed the child
\par of Emancipation to the youth with dawning self-consciousness,
\par self-realization, self-respect.  In those sombre forests of his
\par striving his own soul rose before him, and he saw himself,--darkly as
\par through a veil; and yet he saw in himself some faint revelation of his
\par power, of his mission.  He began to have a dim feeling that, to attain
\par his place in the world, he must be himself, and not another.  For the
\par first time he sought to analyze the burden he bore upon his back, that
\par dead-weight of social degradation partially masked behind a half-named
\par Negro problem.  He felt his poverty; without a cent, without a home,
\par without land, tools, or savings, he had entered into competition with
\par rich, landed, skilled neighbors.  To be a poor man is hard, but to be a
\par poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships.  He
\par felt the weight of his ignorance,--not simply of letters, but of life,
\par of business, of the humanities; the accumulated sloth and shirking and
\par awkwardness of decades and centuries shackled his hands and feet.  Nor
\par was his burden all poverty and ignorance.  The red stain of bastardy,
\par which two centuries of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had
\par stamped upon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African
\par chastity, but also the hereditary weight of a mass of corruption from
\par white adulterers, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home.
\par 
\par A people thus handicapped ought not to be asked to race with the world,
\par but rather allowed to give all its time and thought to its own social
\par problems.  But alas! while sociologists gleefully count his bastards
\par and his prostitutes, the very soul of the toiling, sweating black man
\par is darkened by the shadow of a vast despair.  Men call the shadow
\par prejudice, and learnedly explain it as the natural defence of culture
\par against barbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime,
\par the "higher" against the "lower" races.  To which the Negro cries Amen!
\par and swears that to so much of this strange prejudice as is founded on
\par just homage to civilization, culture, righteousness, and progress, he
\par humbly bows and meekly does obeisance.  But before that nameless
\par prejudice that leaps beyond all this he stands helpless, dismayed, and
\par well-nigh speechless; before that personal disrespect and mockery, the
\par ridicule and systematic humiliation, the distortion of fact and wanton
\par license of fancy, the cynical ignoring of the better and the boisterous
\par welcoming of the worse, the all-pervading desire to inculcate disdain
\par for everything black, from Toussaint to the devil,--before this there
\par rises a sickening despair that would disarm and discourage any nation
\par save that black host to whom "discouragement" is an unwritten word.
\par 
\par But the facing of so vast a prejudice could not but bring the
\par inevitable self-questioning, self-disparagement, and lowering of ideals
\par which ever accompany repression and breed in an atmosphere of contempt
\par and hate.  Whisperings and portents came home upon the four winds: Lo!
\par we are diseased and dying, cried the dark hosts; we cannot write, our
\par voting is vain; what need of education, since we must always cook and
\par serve?  And the Nation echoed and enforced this self-criticism, saying:
\par Be content to be servants, and nothing more; what need of higher
\par culture for half-men?  Away with the black man's ballot, by force or
\par fraud,--and behold the suicide of a race!  Nevertheless, out of the
\par evil came something of good,--the more careful adjustment of education
\par to real life, the clearer perception of the Negroes' social
\par responsibilities, and the sobering realization of the meaning of
\par progress.
\par 
\par So dawned the time of Sturm und Drang: storm and stress to-day rocks
\par our little boat on the mad waters of the world-sea; there is within and
\par without the sound of conflict, the burning of body and rending of soul;
\par inspiration strives with doubt, and faith with vain questionings.  The
\par bright ideals of the past,--physical freedom, political power, the
\par training of brains and the training of hands,--all these in turn have
\par waxed and waned, until even the last grows dim and overcast.  Are they
\par all wrong,--all false?  No, not that, but each alone was over-simple
\par and incomplete,--the dreams of a credulous race-childhood, or the fond
\par imaginings of the other world which does not know and does not want to
\par know our power.  To be really true, all these ideals must be melted and
\par welded into one.  The training of the schools we need to-day more than
\par ever,--the training of deft hands, quick eyes and ears, and above all
\par the broader, deeper, higher culture of gifted minds and pure hearts.
\par The power of the ballot we need in sheer self-defence,--else what shall
\par save us from a second slavery?  Freedom, too, the long-sought, we still
\par seek,--the freedom of life and limb, the freedom to work and think, the
\par freedom to love and aspire.  Work, culture, liberty,--all these we
\par need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each
\par growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that
\par swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained
\par through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and
\par developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or
\par contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater
\par ideals of the American Republic, in order that some day on American
\par soil two world-races may give each to each those characteristics both
\par so sadly lack.  We the darker ones come even now not altogether
\par empty-handed: there are to-day no truer exponents of the pure human
\par spirit of the Declaration of Independence than the American Negroes;
\par there is no true American music but the wild sweet melodies of the
\par Negro slave; the American fairy tales and folklore are Indian and
\par African; and, all in all, we black men seem the sole oasis of simple
\par faith and reverence in a dusty desert of dollars and smartness.  Will
\par America be poorer if she replace her brutal dyspeptic blundering with
\par light-hearted but determined Negro humility? or her coarse and cruel
\par wit with loving jovial good-humor? or her vulgar music with the soul of
\par the Sorrow Songs?
\par 
\par Merely a concrete test of the underlying principles of the great
\par republic is the Negro Problem, and the spiritual striving of the
\par freedmen's sons is the travail of souls whose burden is almost beyond
\par the measure of their strength, but who bear it in the name of an
\par historic race, in the name of this the land of their fathers' fathers,
\par and in the name of human opportunity.
\par 
\par 
\par And now what I have briefly sketched in large outline let me on coming
\par pages tell again in many ways, with loving emphasis and deeper detail,
\par that men may listen to the striving in the souls of black folk.
\par

\par II
\par 
\par Of the Dawn of Freedom
\par 
\par   Careless seems the great Avenger;
\par     History's lessons but record
\par   One death-grapple in the darkness
\par     'Twixt old systems and the Word;
\par   Truth forever on the scaffold,
\par     Wrong forever on the throne;
\par   Yet that scaffold sways the future,
\par     And behind the dim unknown
\par   Standeth God within the shadow
\par     Keeping watch above His own.
\par 
\par   LOWELL.
\par 
\par 
\par The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the
\par color-line,--the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in
\par Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.  It was a phase
\par of this problem that caused the Civil War; and however much they who
\par marched South and North in 1861 may have fixed on the technical points,
\par of union and local autonomy as a shibboleth, all nevertheless knew, as
\par we know, that the question of Negro slavery was the real cause of the
\par conflict.  Curious it was, too, how this deeper question ever forced
\par itself to the surface despite effort and disclaimer.  No sooner had
\par Northern armies touched Southern soil than this old question, newly
\par guised, sprang from the earth,--What shall be done with Negroes?
\par Peremptory military commands this way and that, could not answer the
\par query; the Emancipation Proclamation seemed but to broaden and
\par intensify the difficulties; and the War Amendments made the Negro
\par problems of to-day.
\par 
\par It is the aim of this essay to study the period of history from 1861 to
\par 1872 so far as it relates to the American Negro.  In effect, this tale
\par of the dawn of Freedom is an account of that government of men called
\par the Freedmen's Bureau,--one of the most singular and interesting of the
\par attempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race
\par and social condition.
\par 
\par The war has naught to do with slaves, cried Congress, the President,
\par and the Nation; and yet no sooner had the armies, East and West,
\par penetrated Virginia and Tennessee than fugitive slaves appeared within
\par their lines.  They came at night, when the flickering camp-fires shone
\par like vast unsteady stars along the black horizon: old men and thin,
\par with gray and tufted hair; women with frightened eyes, dragging
\par whimpering hungry children; men and girls, stalwart and gaunt,--a horde
\par of starving vagabonds, homeless, helpless, and pitiable, in their dark
\par distress.  Two methods of treating these newcomers seemed equally
\par logical to opposite sorts of minds.  Ben Butler, in Virginia, quickly
\par declared slave property contraband of war, and put the fugitives to
\par work; while Fremont, in Missouri, declared the slaves free under
\par martial law.  Butler's action was approved, but Fremont's was hastily
\par countermanded, and his successor, Halleck, saw things differently.
\par "Hereafter," he commanded, "no slaves should be allowed to come into
\par your lines at all; if any come without your knowledge, when owners call
\par for them deliver them."  Such a policy was difficult to enforce; some
\par of the black refugees declared themselves freemen, others showed that
\par their masters had deserted them, and still others were captured with
\par forts and plantations.  Evidently, too, slaves were a source of
\par strength to the Confederacy, and were being used as laborers and
\par producers.  "They constitute a military resource," wrote Secretary
\par Cameron, late in 1861; "and being such, that they should not be turned
\par over to the enemy is too plain to discuss."  So gradually the tone of
\par the army chiefs changed; Congress forbade the rendition of fugitives,
\par and Butler's "contrabands" were welcomed as military laborers.  This
\par complicated rather than solved the problem, for now the scattering
\par fugitives became a steady stream, which flowed faster as the armies
\par marched.
\par 
\par Then the long-headed man with care-chiselled face who sat in the White
\par House saw the inevitable, and emancipated the slaves of rebels on New
\par Year's, 1863.  A month later Congress called earnestly for the Negro
\par soldiers whom the act of July, 1862, had half grudgingly allowed to
\par enlist.  Thus the barriers were levelled and the deed was done.  The
\par stream of fugitives swelled to a flood, and anxious army officers kept
\par inquiring: "What must be done with slaves, arriving almost daily?  Are
\par we to find food and shelter for women and children?"
\par 
\par It was a Pierce of Boston who pointed out the way, and thus became in a
\par sense the founder of the Freedmen's Bureau.  He was a firm friend of
\par Secretary Chase; and when, in 1861, the care of slaves and abandoned
\par lands devolved upon the Treasury officials, Pierce was specially
\par detailed from the ranks to study the conditions.  First, he cared for
\par the refugees at Fortress Monroe; and then, after Sherman had captured
\par Hilton Head, Pierce was sent there to found his Port Royal experiment
\par of making free workingmen out of slaves.  Before his experiment was
\par barely started, however, the problem of the fugitives had assumed such
\par proportions that it was taken from the hands of the over-burdened
\par Treasury Department and given to the army officials.  Already centres
\par of massed freedmen were forming at Fortress Monroe, Washington, New
\par Orleans, Vicksburg and Corinth, Columbus, Ky., and Cairo, Ill., as well
\par as at Port Royal.  Army chaplains found here new and fruitful fields;
\par "superintendents of contrabands" multiplied, and some attempt at
\par systematic work was made by enlisting the able-bodied men and giving
\par work to the others.
\par 
\par Then came the Freedmen's Aid societies, born of the touching appeals
\par from Pierce and from these other centres of distress.  There was the
\par American Missionary Association, sprung from the Amistad, and now
\par full-grown for work; the various church organizations, the National
\par Freedmen's Relief Association, the American Freedmen's Union, the
\par Western Freedmen's Aid Commission,--in all fifty or more active
\par organizations, which sent clothes, money, school-books, and teachers
\par southward.  All they did was needed, for the destitution of the
\par freedmen was often reported as "too appalling for belief," and the
\par situation was daily growing worse rather than better.
\par 
\par And daily, too, it seemed more plain that this was no ordinary matter
\par of temporary relief, but a national crisis; for here loomed a labor
\par problem of vast dimensions.  Masses of Negroes stood idle, or, if they
\par worked spasmodically, were never sure of pay; and if perchance they
\par received pay, squandered the new thing thoughtlessly.  In these and
\par other ways were camp-life and the new liberty demoralizing the
\par freedmen.  The broader economic organization thus clearly demanded
\par sprang up here and there as accident and local conditions determined.
\par Here it was that Pierce's Port Royal plan of leased plantations and
\par guided workmen pointed out the rough way.  In Washington the military
\par governor, at the urgent appeal of the superintendent, opened
\par confiscated estates to the cultivation of the fugitives, and there in
\par the shadow of the dome gathered black farm villages.  General Dix gave
\par over estates to the freedmen of Fortress Monroe, and so on, South and
\par West.  The government and benevolent societies furnished the means of
\par cultivation, and the Negro turned again slowly to work.  The systems of
\par control, thus started, rapidly grew, here and there, into strange
\par little governments, like that of General Banks in Louisiana, with its
\par ninety thousand black subjects, its fifty thousand guided laborers, and
\par its annual budget of one hundred thousand dollars and more.  It made
\par out four thousand pay-rolls a year, registered all freedmen, inquired
\par into grievances and redressed them, laid and collected taxes, and
\par established a system of public schools.  So, too, Colonel Eaton, the
\par superintendent of Tennessee and Arkansas, ruled over one hundred
\par thousand freedmen, leased and cultivated seven thousand acres of cotton
\par land, and fed ten thousand paupers a year.  In South Carolina was
\par General Saxton, with his deep interest in black folk.  He succeeded
\par Pierce and the Treasury officials, and sold forfeited estates, leased
\par abandoned plantations, encouraged schools, and received from Sherman,
\par after that terribly picturesque march to the sea, thousands of the
\par wretched camp followers.
\par 
\par Three characteristic things one might have seen in Sherman's raid
\par through Georgia, which threw the new situation in shadowy relief: the
\par Conqueror, the Conquered, and the Negro.  Some see all significance in
\par the grim front of the destroyer, and some in the bitter sufferers of
\par the Lost Cause.  But to me neither soldier nor fugitive speaks with so
\par deep a meaning as that dark human cloud that clung like remorse on the
\par rear of those swift columns, swelling at times to half their size,
\par almost engulfing and choking them.  In vain were they ordered back, in
\par vain were bridges hewn from beneath their feet; on they trudged and
\par writhed and surged, until they rolled into Savannah, a starved and
\par naked horde of tens of thousands.  There too came the characteristic
\par military remedy: "The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned
\par rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and
\par the country bordering the St. John's River, Florida, are reserved and
\par set apart for the settlement of Negroes now made free by act of war."
\par So read the celebrated "Field-order Number Fifteen."
\par 
\par All these experiments, orders, and systems were bound to attract and
\par perplex the government and the nation.  Directly after the Emancipation
\par Proclamation, Representative Eliot had introduced a bill creating a
\par Bureau of Emancipation; but it was never reported.  The following June
\par a committee of inquiry, appointed by the Secretary of War, reported in
\par favor of a temporary bureau for the "improvement, protection, and
\par employment of refugee freedmen," on much the same lines as were
\par afterwards followed.  Petitions came in to President Lincoln from
\par distinguished citizens and organizations, strongly urging a
\par comprehensive and unified plan of dealing with the freedmen, under a
\par bureau which should be "charged with the study of plans and execution
\par of measures for easily guiding, and in every way judiciously and
\par humanely aiding, the passage of our emancipated and yet to be
\par emancipated blacks from the old condition of forced labor to their new
\par state of voluntary industry."
\par 
\par Some half-hearted steps were taken to accomplish this, in part, by
\par putting the whole matter again in charge of the special Treasury
\par agents.  Laws of 1863 and 1864 directed them to take charge of and
\par lease abandoned lands for periods not exceeding twelve months, and to
\par "provide in such leases, or otherwise, for the employment and general
\par welfare" of the freedmen.  Most of the army officers greeted this as a
\par welcome relief from perplexing "Negro affairs," and Secretary
\par Fessenden, July 29, 1864, issued an excellent system of regulations,
\par which were afterward closely followed by General Howard.  Under
\par Treasury agents, large quantities of land were leased in the
\par Mississippi Valley, and many Negroes were employed; but in August,
\par 1864, the new regulations were suspended for reasons of "public
\par policy," and the army was again in control.
\par 
\par Meanwhile Congress had turned its attention to the subject; and in
\par March the House passed a bill by a majority of two establishing a
\par Bureau for Freedmen in the War Department.  Charles Sumner, who had
\par charge of the bill in the Senate, argued that freedmen and abandoned
\par lands ought to be under the same department, and reported a substitute
\par for the House bill attaching the Bureau to the Treasury Department.
\par This bill passed, but too late for action by the House.  The debates
\par wandered over the whole policy of the administration and the general
\par question of slavery, without touching very closely the specific merits
\par of the measure in hand.  Then the national election took place; and the
\par administration, with a vote of renewed confidence from the country,
\par addressed itself to the matter more seriously.  A conference between
\par the two branches of Congress agreed upon a carefully drawn measure
\par which contained the chief provisions of Sumner's bill, but made the
\par proposed organization a department independent of both the War and the
\par Treasury officials.  The bill was conservative, giving the new
\par department "general superintendence of all freedmen."  Its purpose was
\par to "establish regulations" for them, protect them, lease them lands,
\par adjust their wages, and appear in civil and military courts as their
\par "next friend." There were many limitations attached to the powers thus
\par granted, and the organization was made permanent.  Nevertheless, the
\par Senate defeated the bill, and a new conference committee was appointed.
\par This committee reported a new bill, February 28, which was whirled
\par through just as the session closed, and became the act of 1865
\par establishing in the War Department a "Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and
\par Abandoned Lands."
\par 
\par This last compromise was a hasty bit of legislation, vague and
\par uncertain in outline.  A Bureau was created, "to continue during the
\par present War of Rebellion, and for one year thereafter," to which was
\par given "the supervision and management of all abandoned lands and the
\par control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen," under "such
\par rules and regulations as may be presented by the head of the Bureau and
\par approved by the President."  A Commissioner, appointed by the President
\par and Senate, was to control the Bureau, with an office force not
\par exceeding ten clerks.  The President might also appoint assistant
\par commissioners in the seceded States, and to all these offices military
\par officials might be detailed at regular pay.  The Secretary of War could
\par issue rations, clothing, and fuel to the destitute, and all abandoned
\par property was placed in the hands of the Bureau for eventual lease and
\par sale to ex-slaves in forty-acre parcels.
\par 
\par Thus did the United States government definitely assume charge of the
\par emancipated Negro as the ward of the nation.  It was a tremendous
\par undertaking.  Here at a stroke of the pen was erected a government of
\par millions of men,--and not ordinary men either, but black men
\par emasculated by a peculiarly complete system of slavery, centuries old;
\par and now, suddenly, violently, they come into a new birthright, at a
\par time of war and passion, in the midst of the stricken and embittered
\par population of their former masters.  Any man might well have hesitated
\par to assume charge of such a work, with vast responsibilities, indefinite
\par powers, and limited resources.  Probably no one but a soldier would
\par have answered such a call promptly; and, indeed, no one but a soldier
\par could be called, for Congress had appropriated no money for salaries
\par and expenses.
\par 
\par Less than a month after the weary Emancipator passed to his rest, his
\par successor assigned Major-Gen. Oliver O. Howard to duty as Commissioner
\par of the new Bureau.  He was a Maine man, then only thirty-five years of
\par age.  He had marched with Sherman to the sea, had fought well at
\par Gettysburg, and but the year before had been assigned to the command of
\par the Department of Tennessee.  An honest man, with too much faith in
\par human nature, little aptitude for business and intricate detail, he had
\par had large opportunity of becoming acquainted at first hand with much of
\par the work before him.  And of that work it has been truly said that "no
\par approximately correct history of civilization can ever be written which
\par does not throw out in bold relief, as one of the great landmarks of
\par political and social progress, the organization and administration of
\par the Freedmen's Bureau."
\par 
\par On May 12, 1865, Howard was appointed; and he assumed the duties of his
\par office promptly on the 15th, and began examining the field of work.  A
\par curious mess he looked upon: little despotisms, communistic
\par experiments, slavery, peonage, business speculations, organized
\par charity, unorganized almsgiving,--all reeling on under the guise of
\par helping the freedmen, and all enshrined in the smoke and blood of the
\par war and the cursing and silence of angry men.  On May 19 the new
\par government--for a government it really was--issued its constitution;
\par commissioners were to be appointed in each of the seceded states, who
\par were to take charge of "all subjects relating to refugees and
\par freedmen," and all relief and rations were to be given by their consent
\par alone.  The Bureau invited continued cooperation with benevolent
\par societies, and declared: "It will be the object of all commissioners to
\par introduce practicable systems of compensated labor," and to establish
\par schools.  Forthwith nine assistant commissioners were appointed.  They
\par were to hasten to their fields of work; seek gradually to close relief
\par establishments, and make the destitute self-supporting; act as courts
\par of law where there were no courts, or where Negroes were not recognized
\par in them as free; establish the institution of marriage among ex-slaves,
\par and keep records; see that freedmen were free to choose their
\par employers, and help in making fair contracts for them; and finally, the
\par circular said: "Simple good faith, for which we hope on all hands for
\par those concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve
\par the assistant commissioners in the discharge of their duties toward the
\par freedmen, as well as promote the general welfare."
\par 
\par No sooner was the work thus started, and the general system and local
\par organization in some measure begun, than two grave difficulties
\par appeared which changed largely the theory and outcome of Bureau work.
\par First, there were the abandoned lands of the South.  It had long been
\par the more or less definitely expressed theory of the North that all the
\par chief problems of Emancipation might be settled by establishing the
\par slaves on the forfeited lands of their masters,--a sort of poetic
\par justice, said some.  But this poetry done into solemn prose meant
\par either wholesale confiscation of private property in the South, or vast
\par appropriations.  Now Congress had not appropriated a cent, and no
\par sooner did the proclamations of general amnesty appear than the eight
\par hundred thousand acres of abandoned lands in the hands of the
\par Freedmen's Bureau melted quickly away.  The second difficulty lay in
\par perfecting the local organization of the Bureau throughout the wide
\par field of work.  Making a new machine and sending out officials of duly
\par ascertained fitness for a great work of social reform is no child's
\par task; but this task was even harder, for a new central organization had
\par to be fitted on a heterogeneous and confused but already existing
\par system of relief and control of ex-slaves; and the agents available for
\par this work must be sought for in an army still busy with war
\par operations,--men in the very nature of the case ill fitted for delicate
\par social work,--or among the questionable camp followers of an invading
\par host.  Thus, after a year's work, vigorously as it was pushed, the
\par problem looked even more difficult to grasp and solve than at the
\par beginning.  Nevertheless, three things that year's work did, well worth
\par the doing: it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it
\par transported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the
\par farm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England
\par schoolma'am.
\par 
\par The annals of this Ninth Crusade are yet to be written,--the tale of a
\par mission that seemed to our age far more quixotic than the quest of St.
\par Louis seemed to his.  Behind the mists of ruin and rapine waved the
\par calico dresses of women who dared, and after the hoarse mouthings of
\par the field guns rang the rhythm of the alphabet.  Rich and poor they
\par were, serious and curious.  Bereaved now of a father, now of a brother,
\par now of more than these, they came seeking a life work in planting New
\par England schoolhouses among the white and black of the South.  They did
\par their work well.  In that first year they taught one hundred thousand
\par souls, and more.
\par 
\par Evidently, Congress must soon legislate again on the hastily organized
\par Bureau, which had so quickly grown into wide significance and vast
\par possibilities.  An institution such as that was well-nigh as difficult
\par to end as to begin.  Early in 1866 Congress took up the matter, when
\par Senator Trumbull, of Illinois, introduced a bill to extend the Bureau
\par and enlarge its powers.  This measure received, at the hands of
\par Congress, far more thorough discussion and attention than its
\par predecessor.  The war cloud had thinned enough to allow a clearer
\par conception of the work of Emancipation.  The champions of the bill
\par argued that the strengthening of the Freedmen's Bureau was still a
\par military necessity; that it was needed for the proper carrying out of
\par the Thirteenth Amendment, and was a work of sheer justice to the
\par ex-slave, at a trifling cost to the government.  The opponents of the
\par measure declared that the war was over, and the necessity for war
\par measures past; that the Bureau, by reason of its extraordinary powers,
\par was clearly unconstitutional in time of peace, and was destined to
\par irritate the South and pauperize the freedmen, at a final cost of
\par possibly hundreds of millions.  These two arguments were unanswered,
\par and indeed unanswerable: the one that the extraordinary powers of the
\par Bureau threatened the civil rights of all citizens; and the other that
\par the government must have power to do what manifestly must be done, and
\par that present abandonment of the freedmen meant their practical
\par reenslavement.  The bill which finally passed enlarged and made
\par permanent the Freedmen's Bureau.  It was promptly vetoed by President
\par Johnson as "unconstitutional," "unnecessary," and "extrajudicial," and
\par failed of passage over the veto.  Meantime, however, the breach between
\par Congress and the President began to broaden, and a modified form of the
\par lost bill was finally passed over the President's second veto, July 16.
\par 
\par The act of 1866 gave the Freedmen's Bureau its final form,--the form by
\par which it will be known to posterity and judged of men.  It extended the
\par existence of the Bureau to July, 1868; it authorized additional
\par assistant commissioners, the retention of army officers mustered out of
\par regular service, the sale of certain forfeited lands to freedmen on
\par nominal terms, the sale of Confederate public property for Negro
\par schools, and a wider field of judicial interpretation and cognizance.
\par The government of the unreconstructed South was thus put very largely
\par in the hands of the Freedmen's Bureau, especially as in many cases the
\par departmental military commander was now made also assistant
\par commissioner.  It was thus that the Freedmen's Bureau became a
\par full-fledged government of men.  It made laws, executed them and
\par interpreted them; it laid and collected taxes, defined and punished
\par crime, maintained and used military force, and dictated such measures
\par as it thought necessary and proper for the accomplishment of its varied
\par ends.  Naturally, all these powers were not exercised continuously nor
\par to their fullest extent; and yet, as General Howard has said, "scarcely
\par any subject that has to be legislated upon in civil society failed, at
\par one time or another, to demand the action of this singular Bureau."
\par 
\par To understand and criticise intelligently so vast a work, one must not
\par forget an instant the drift of things in the later sixties.  Lee had
\par surrendered, Lincoln was dead, and Johnson and Congress were at
\par loggerheads; the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted, the Fourteenth
\par pending, and the Fifteenth declared in force in 1870.  Guerrilla
\par raiding, the ever-present flickering after-flame of war, was spending
\par its forces against the Negroes, and all the Southern land was awakening
\par as from some wild dream to poverty and social revolution.  In a time of
\par perfect calm, amid willing neighbors and streaming wealth, the social
\par uplifting of four million slaves to an assured and self-sustaining
\par place in the body politic and economic would have been a herculean
\par task; but when to the inherent difficulties of so delicate and nice a
\par social operation were added the spite and hate of conflict, the hell of
\par war; when suspicion and cruelty were rife, and gaunt Hunger wept beside
\par Bereavement,--in such a case, the work of any instrument of social
\par regeneration was in large part foredoomed to failure.  The very name of
\par the Bureau stood for a thing in the South which for two centuries and
\par better men had refused even to argue,--that life amid free Negroes was
\par simply unthinkable, the maddest of experiments.
\par 
\par The agents that the Bureau could command varied all the way from
\par unselfish philanthropists to narrow-minded busybodies and thieves; and
\par even though it be true that the average was far better than the worst,
\par it was the occasional fly that helped spoil the ointment.
\par 
\par Then amid all crouched the freed slave, bewildered between friend and
\par foe.  He had emerged from slavery,--not the worst slavery in the world,
\par not a slavery that made all life unbearable, rather a slavery that had
\par here and there something of kindliness, fidelity, and happiness,--but
\par withal slavery, which, so far as human aspiration and desert were
\par concerned, classed the black man and the ox together.  And the Negro
\par knew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may have been,
\par Southern men had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate this
\par slavery under which the black masses, with half-articulate thought, had
\par writhed and shivered.  They welcomed freedom with a cry.  They shrank
\par from the master who still strove for their chains; they fled to the
\par friends that had freed them, even though those friends stood ready to
\par use them as a club for driving the recalcitrant South back into
\par loyalty.  So the cleft between the white and black South grew.  Idle to
\par say it never should have been; it was as inevitable as its results were
\par pitiable.  Curiously incongruous elements were left arrayed against
\par each other,--the North, the government, the carpet-bagger, and the
\par slave, here; and there, all the South that was white, whether gentleman
\par or vagabond, honest man or rascal, lawless murderer or martyr to duty.
\par 
\par Thus it is doubly difficult to write of this period calmly, so intense
\par was the feeling, so mighty the human passions that swayed and blinded
\par men.  Amid it all, two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming
\par ages,--the one, a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers had quit
\par themselves like men, whose sons lay in nameless graves; who bowed to
\par the evil of slavery because its abolition threatened untold ill to all;
\par who stood at last, in the evening of life, a blighted, ruined form,
\par with hate in his eyes;--and the other, a form hovering dark and
\par mother-like, her awful face black with the mists of centuries, had
\par aforetime quailed at that white master's command, had bent in love over
\par the cradles of his sons and daughters, and closed in death the sunken
\par eyes of his wife,--aye, too, at his behest had laid herself low to his
\par lust, and borne a tawny man-child to the world, only to see her dark
\par boy's limbs scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after
\par "damned Niggers."  These were the saddest sights of that woful day; and
\par no man clasped the hands of these two passing figures of the
\par present-past; but, hating, they went to their long home, and, hating,
\par their children's children live today.
\par 
\par Here, then, was the field of work for the Freedmen's Bureau; and since,
\par with some hesitation, it was continued by the act of 1868 until 1869,
\par let us look upon four years of its work as a whole.  There were, in
\par 1868, nine hundred Bureau officials scattered from Washington to Texas,
\par ruling, directly and indirectly, many millions of men.  The deeds of
\par these rulers fall mainly under seven heads: the relief of physical
\par suffering, the overseeing of the beginnings of free labor, the buying
\par and selling of land, the establishment of schools, the paying of
\par bounties, the administration of justice, and the financiering of all
\par these activities.
\par 
\par Up to June, 1869, over half a million patients had been treated by
\par Bureau physicians and surgeons, and sixty hospitals and asylums had
\par been in operation.  In fifty months twenty-one million free rations
\par were distributed at a cost of over four million dollars.  Next came the
\par difficult question of labor.  First, thirty thousand black men were
\par transported from the refuges and relief stations back to the farms,
\par back to the critical trial of a new way of working.  Plain instructions
\par went out from Washington: the laborers must be free to choose their
\par employers, no fixed rate of wages was prescribed, and there was to be
\par no peonage or forced labor.  So far, so good; but where local agents
\par differed toto caelo in capacity and character, where the personnel was
\par continually changing, the outcome was necessarily varied.  The largest
\par element of success lay in the fact that the majority of the freedmen
\par were willing, even eager, to work.  So labor contracts were
\par written,--fifty thousand in a single State,--laborers advised, wages
\par guaranteed, and employers supplied.  In truth, the organization became
\par a vast labor bureau,--not perfect, indeed, notably defective here and
\par there, but on the whole successful beyond the dreams of thoughtful men.
\par The two great obstacles which confronted the officials were the tyrant
\par and the idler,--the slaveholder who was determined to perpetuate
\par slavery under another name; and, the freedman who regarded freedom as
\par perpetual rest,--the Devil and the Deep Sea.
\par 
\par In the work of establishing the Negroes as peasant proprietors, the
\par Bureau was from the first handicapped and at last absolutely checked.
\par Something was done, and larger things were planned; abandoned lands
\par were leased so long as they remained in the hands of the Bureau, and a
\par total revenue of nearly half a million dollars derived from black
\par tenants.  Some other lands to which the nation had gained title were
\par sold on easy terms, and public lands were opened for settlement to the
\par very few freedmen who had tools and capital.  But the vision of "forty
\par acres and a mule"--the righteous and reasonable ambition to become a
\par landholder, which the nation had all but categorically promised the
\par freedmen--was destined in most cases to bitter disappointment.  And
\par those men of marvellous hindsight who are today seeking to preach the
\par Negro back to the present peonage of the soil know well, or ought to
\par know, that the opportunity of binding the Negro peasant willingly to
\par the soil was lost on that day when the Commissioner of the Freedmen's
\par Bureau had to go to South Carolina and tell the weeping freedmen, after
\par their years of toil, that their land was not theirs, that there was a
\par mistake--somewhere.  If by 1874 the Georgia Negro alone owned three
\par hundred and fifty thousand acres of land, it was by grace of his thrift
\par rather than by bounty of the government.
\par 
\par The greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of
\par the free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary
\par education among all classes in the South.  It not only called the
\par school-mistresses through the benevolent agencies and built them
\par schoolhouses, but it helped discover and support such apostles of human
\par culture as Edmund Ware, Samuel Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath.  The
\par opposition to Negro education in the South was at first bitter, and
\par showed itself in ashes, insult, and blood; for the South believed an
\par educated Negro to be a dangerous Negro.  And the South was not wholly
\par wrong; for education among all kinds of men always has had, and always
\par will have, an element of danger and revolution, of dissatisfaction and
\par discontent.  Nevertheless, men strive to know.  Perhaps some inkling of
\par this paradox, even in the unquiet days of the Bureau, helped the
\par bayonets allay an opposition to human training which still to-day lies
\par smouldering in the South, but not flaming.  Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and
\par Hampton were founded in these days, and six million dollars were
\par expended for educational work, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
\par of which the freedmen themselves gave of their poverty.
\par 
\par Such contributions, together with the buying of land and various other
\par enterprises, showed that the ex-slave was handling some free capital
\par already.  The chief initial source of this was labor in the army, and
\par his pay and bounty as a soldier.  Payments to Negro soldiers were at
\par first complicated by the ignorance of the recipients, and the fact that
\par the quotas of colored regiments from Northern States were largely
\par filled by recruits from the South, unknown to their fellow soldiers.
\par Consequently, payments were accompanied by such frauds that Congress,
\par by joint resolution in 1867, put the whole matter in the hands of the
\par Freedmen's Bureau.  In two years six million dollars was thus
\par distributed to five thousand claimants, and in the end the sum exceeded
\par eight million dollars.  Even in this system fraud was frequent; but
\par still the work put needed capital in the hands of practical paupers,
\par and some, at least, was well spent.
\par 
\par The most perplexing and least successful part of the Bureau's work lay
\par in the exercise of its judicial functions.  The regular Bureau court
\par consisted of one representative of the employer, one of the Negro, and
\par one of the Bureau.  If the Bureau could have maintained a perfectly
\par judicial attitude, this arrangement would have been ideal, and must in
\par time have gained confidence; but the nature of its other activities and
\par the character of its personnel prejudiced the Bureau in favor of the
\par black litigants, and led without doubt to much injustice and annoyance.
\par On the other hand, to leave the Negro in the hands of Southern courts
\par was impossible.  In a distracted land where slavery had hardly fallen,
\par to keep the strong from wanton abuse of the weak, and the weak from
\par gloating insolently over the half-shorn strength of the strong, was a
\par thankless, hopeless task.  The former masters of the land were
\par peremptorily ordered about, seized, and imprisoned, and punished over
\par and again, with scant courtesy from army officers.  The former slaves
\par were intimidated, beaten, raped, and butchered by angry and revengeful
\par men.  Bureau courts tended to become centres simply for punishing
\par whites, while the regular civil courts tended to become solely
\par institutions for perpetuating the slavery of blacks.  Almost every law
\par and method ingenuity could devise was employed by the legislatures to
\par reduce the Negroes to serfdom,--to make them the slaves of the State,
\par if not of individual owners; while the Bureau officials too often were
\par found striving to put the "bottom rail on top," and gave the freedmen a
\par power and independence which they could not yet use.  It is all well
\par enough for us of another generation to wax wise with advice to those
\par who bore the burden in the heat of the day.  It is full easy now to see
\par that the man who lost home, fortune, and family at a stroke, and saw
\par his land ruled by "mules and niggers," was really benefited by the
\par passing of slavery.  It is not difficult now to say to the young
\par freedman, cheated and cuffed about who has seen his father's head
\par beaten to a jelly and his own mother namelessly assaulted, that the
\par meek shall inherit the earth.  Above all, nothing is more convenient
\par than to heap on the Freedmen's Bureau all the evils of that evil day,
\par and damn it utterly for every mistake and blunder that was made.
\par 
\par All this is easy, but it is neither sensible nor just.  Someone had
\par blundered, but that was long before Oliver Howard was born; there was
\par criminal aggression and heedless neglect, but without some system of
\par control there would have been far more than there was.  Had that
\par control been from within, the Negro would have been re-enslaved, to all
\par intents and purposes.  Coming as the control did from without, perfect
\par men and methods would have bettered all things; and even with imperfect
\par agents and questionable methods, the work accomplished was not
\par undeserving of commendation.
\par 
\par  Such was the dawn of Freedom; such was the work of the
\par Freedmen's Bureau, which, summed up in brief, may be epitomized thus:
\par for some fifteen million dollars, beside the sums spent before 1865,
\par and the dole of benevolent societies, this Bureau set going a system of
\par free labor, established a beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured
\par the recognition of black freedmen before courts of law, and founded the
\par free common school in the South.  On the other hand, it failed to begin
\par the establishment of good-will between ex-masters and freedmen, to
\par guard its work wholly from paternalistic methods which discouraged
\par self-reliance, and to carry out to any considerable extent its implied
\par promises to furnish the freedmen with land.  Its successes were the
\par result of hard work, supplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the
\par eager striving of black men.  Its failures were the result of bad local
\par agents, the inherent difficulties of the work, and national neglect.
\par 
\par Such an institution, from its wide powers, great responsibilities,
\par large control of moneys, and generally conspicuous position, was
\par naturally open to repeated and bitter attack.  It sustained a searching
\par Congressional investigation at the instance of Fernando Wood in 1870.
\par Its archives and few remaining functions were with blunt discourtesy
\par transferred from Howard's control, in his absence, to the supervision
\par of Secretary of War Belknap in 1872, on the Secretary's recommendation.
\par Finally, in consequence of grave intimations of wrong-doing made by the
\par Secretary and his subordinates, General Howard was court-martialed in
\par 1874.  In both of these trials the Commissioner of the Freedmen's
\par Bureau was officially exonerated from any wilful misdoing, and his work
\par commended.  Nevertheless, many unpleasant things were brought to
\par light,--the methods of transacting the business of the Bureau were
\par faulty; several cases of defalcation were proved, and other frauds
\par strongly suspected; there were some business transactions which savored
\par of dangerous speculation, if not dishonesty; and around it all lay the
\par smirch of the Freedmen's Bank.
\par 
\par Morally and practically, the Freedmen's Bank was part of the Freedmen's
\par Bureau, although it had no legal connection with it.  With the prestige
\par of the government back of it, and a directing board of unusual
\par respectability and national reputation, this banking institution had
\par made a remarkable start in the development of that thrift among black
\par folk which slavery had kept them from knowing.  Then in one sad day
\par came the crash,--all the hard-earned dollars of the freedmen
\par disappeared; but that was the least of the loss,--all the faith in
\par saving went too, and much of the faith in men; and that was a loss that
\par a Nation which to-day sneers at Negro shiftlessness has never yet made
\par good.  Not even ten additional years of slavery could have done so much
\par to throttle the thrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and
\par bankruptcy of the series of savings banks chartered by the Nation for
\par their especial aid.  Where all the blame should rest, it is hard to
\par say; whether the Bureau and the Bank died chiefly by reason of the
\par blows of its selfish friends or the dark machinations of its foes,
\par perhaps even time will never reveal, for here lies unwritten history.
\par 
\par Of the foes without the Bureau, the bitterest were those who attacked
\par not so much its conduct or policy under the law as the necessity for
\par any such institution at all.  Such attacks came primarily from the
\par Border States and the South; and they were summed up by Senator Davis,
\par of Kentucky, when he moved to entitle the act of 1866 a bill "to
\par promote strife and conflict between the white and black races . . . by
\par a grant of unconstitutional power."  The argument gathered tremendous
\par strength South and North; but its very strength was its weakness.  For,
\par argued the plain common-sense of the nation, if it is unconstitutional,
\par unpractical, and futile for the nation to stand guardian over its
\par helpless wards, then there is left but one alternative,--to make those
\par wards their own guardians by arming them with the ballot.  Moreover,
\par the path of the practical politician pointed the same way; for, argued
\par this opportunist, if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with
\par white votes, we certainly can with black votes.  So justice and force
\par joined hands.
\par 
\par The alternative thus offered the nation was not between full and
\par restricted Negro suffrage; else every sensible man, black and white,
\par would easily have chosen the latter.  It was rather a choice between
\par suffrage and slavery, after endless blood and gold had flowed to sweep
\par human bondage away.  Not a single Southern legislature stood ready to
\par admit a Negro, under any conditions, to the polls; not a single
\par Southern legislature believed free Negro labor was possible without a
\par system of restrictions that took all its freedom away; there was
\par scarcely a white man in the South who did not honestly regard
\par Emancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a duty.  In
\par such a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black man was a
\par necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race,
\par and the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of
\par the war.  Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race
\par feud.  And some felt gratitude toward the race thus sacrificed in its
\par swaddling clothes on the altar of national integrity; and some felt and
\par feel only indifference and contempt.
\par 
\par Had political exigencies been less pressing, the opposition to
\par government guardianship of Negroes less bitter, and the attachment to
\par the slave system less strong, the social seer can well imagine a far
\par better policy,--a permanent Freedmen's Bureau, with a national system
\par of Negro schools; a carefully supervised employment and labor office; a
\par system of impartial protection before the regular courts; and such
\par institutions for social betterment as savings-banks, land and building
\par associations, and social settlements.  All this vast expenditure of
\par money and brains might have formed a great school of prospective
\par citizenship, and solved in a way we have not yet solved the most
\par perplexing and persistent of the Negro problems.
\par 
\par That such an institution was unthinkable in 1870 was due in part to
\par certain acts of the Freedmen's Bureau itself.  It came to regard its
\par work as merely temporary, and Negro suffrage as a final answer to all
\par present perplexities.  The political ambition of many of its agents and
\par proteges led it far afield into questionable activities, until the
\par South, nursing its own deep prejudices, came easily to ignore all the
\par good deeds of the Bureau and hate its very name with perfect hatred.
\par So the Freedmen's Bureau died, and its child was the Fifteenth
\par Amendment.
\par 
\par The passing of a great human institution before its work is done, like
\par the untimely passing of a single soul, but leaves a legacy of striving
\par for other men.  The legacy of the Freedmen's Bureau is the heavy
\par heritage of this generation.  To-day, when new and vaster problems are
\par destined to strain every fibre of the national mind and soul, would it
\par not be well to count this legacy honestly and carefully?  For this much
\par all men know: despite compromise, war, and struggle, the Negro is not
\par free.  In the backwoods of the Gulf States, for miles and miles, he may
\par not leave the plantation of his birth; in well-nigh the whole rural
\par South the black farmers are peons, bound by law and custom to an
\par economic slavery, from which the only escape is death or the
\par penitentiary.  In the most cultured sections and cities of the South
\par the Negroes are a segregated servile caste, with restricted rights and
\par privileges.  Before the courts, both in law and custom, they stand on a
\par different and peculiar basis.  Taxation without representation is the
\par rule of their political life.  And the result of all this is, and in
\par nature must have been, lawlessness and crime.  That is the large legacy
\par of the Freedmen's Bureau, the work it did not do because it could not.
\par 
\par 
\par I have seen a land right merry with the sun, where children sing, and
\par rolling hills lie like passioned women wanton with harvest.  And there
\par in the King's Highways sat and sits a figure veiled and bowed, by which
\par the traveller's footsteps hasten as they go.  On the tainted air broods
\par fear.  Three centuries' thought has been the raising and unveiling of
\par that bowed human heart, and now behold a century new for the duty and
\par the deed.  The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the
\par color-line.

\par III
\par 
\par Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others
\par 
\par   From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned!
\par   *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *
\par   Hereditary bondsmen!  Know ye not
\par   Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?
\par 
\par   BYRON.
\par 
\par Easily the most striking thing in the history of the American Negro
\par since 1876 is the ascendancy of Mr. Booker T. Washington.  It began at
\par the time when war memories and ideals were rapidly passing; a day of
\par astonishing commercial development was dawning; a sense of doubt and
\par hesitation overtook the freedmen's sons,--then it was that his leading
\par began.  Mr. Washington came, with a simple definite programme, at the
\par psychological moment when the nation was a little ashamed of having
\par bestowed so much sentiment on Negroes, and was concentrating its
\par energies on Dollars.  His programme of industrial education,
\par conciliation of the South, and submission and silence as to civil and
\par political rights, was not wholly original; the Free Negroes from 1830
\par up to war-time had striven to build industrial schools, and the
\par American Missionary Association had from the first taught various
\par trades; and Price and others had sought a way of honorable alliance
\par with the best of the Southerners.  But Mr. Washington first
\par indissolubly linked these things; he put enthusiasm, unlimited energy,
\par and perfect faith into his programme, and changed it from a by-path
\par into a veritable Way of Life.  And the tale of the methods by which he
\par did this is a fascinating study of human life.
\par 
\par It startled the nation to hear a Negro advocating such a programme
\par after many decades of bitter complaint; it startled and won the
\par applause of the South, it interested and won the admiration of the
\par North; and after a confused murmur of protest, it silenced if it did
\par not convert the Negroes themselves.
\par 
\par To gain the sympathy and cooperation of the various elements comprising
\par the white South was Mr. Washington's first task; and this, at the time
\par Tuskegee was founded, seemed, for a black man, well-nigh impossible.
\par And yet ten years later it was done in the word spoken at Atlanta: "In
\par all things purely social we can be as separate as the five fingers, and
\par yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress."  This
\par "Atlanta Compromise" is by all odds the most notable thing in Mr.
\par Washington's career.  The South interpreted it in different ways: the
\par radicals received it as a complete surrender of the demand for civil
\par and political equality; the conservatives, as a generously conceived
\par working basis for mutual understanding.  So both approved it, and
\par to-day its author is certainly the most distinguished Southerner since
\par Jefferson Davis, and the one with the largest personal following.
\par 
\par Next to this achievement comes Mr. Washington's work in gaining place
\par and consideration in the North.  Others less shrewd and tactful had
\par formerly essayed to sit on these two stools and had fallen between
\par them; but as Mr. Washington knew the heart of the South from birth and
\par training, so by singular insight he intuitively grasped the spirit of
\par the age which was dominating the North.  And so thoroughly did he learn
\par the speech and thought of triumphant commercialism, and the ideals of
\par material prosperity, that the picture of a lone black boy poring over a
\par French grammar amid the weeds and dirt of a neglected home soon seemed
\par to him the acme of absurdities.  One wonders what Socrates and St.
\par Francis of Assisi would say to this.
\par 
\par And yet this very singleness of vision and thorough oneness with his
\par age is a mark of the successful man.  It is as though Nature must needs
\par make men narrow in order to give them force.  So Mr. Washington's cult
\par has gained unquestioning followers, his work has wonderfully prospered,
\par his friends are legion, and his enemies are confounded.  To-day he
\par stands as the one recognized spokesman of his ten million fellows, and
\par one of the most notable figures in a nation of seventy millions.  One
\par hesitates, therefore, to criticise a life which, beginning with so
\par little, has done so much.  And yet the time is come when one may speak
\par in all sincerity and utter courtesy of the mistakes and shortcomings of
\par Mr. Washington's career, as well as of his triumphs, without being
\par thought captious or envious, and without forgetting that it is easier
\par to do ill than well in the world.
\par 
\par The criticism that has hitherto met Mr. Washington has not always been
\par of this broad character.  In the South especially has he had to walk
\par warily to avoid the harshest judgments,--and naturally so, for he is
\par dealing with the one subject of deepest sensitiveness to that section.
\par Twice--once when at the Chicago celebration of the Spanish-American War
\par he alluded to the color-prejudice that is "eating away the vitals of
\par the South," and once when he dined with President Roosevelt--has the
\par resulting Southern criticism been violent enough to threaten seriously
\par his popularity.  In the North the feeling has several times forced
\par itself into words, that Mr. Washington's counsels of submission
\par overlooked certain elements of true manhood, and that his educational
\par programme was unnecessarily narrow.  Usually, however, such criticism
\par has not found open expression, although, too, the spiritual sons of the
\par Abolitionists have not been prepared to acknowledge that the schools
\par founded before Tuskegee, by men of broad ideals and self-sacrificing
\par spirit, were wholly failures or worthy of ridicule.  While, then,
\par criticism has not failed to follow Mr. Washington, yet the prevailing
\par public opinion of the land has been but too willing to deliver the
\par solution of a wearisome problem into his hands, and say, "If that is
\par all you and your race ask, take it."
\par 
\par Among his own people, however, Mr. Washington has encountered the
\par strongest and most lasting opposition, amounting at times to
\par bitterness, and even today continuing strong and insistent even though
\par largely silenced in outward expression by the public opinion of the
\par nation.  Some of this opposition is, of course, mere envy; the
\par disappointment of displaced demagogues and the spite of narrow minds.
\par But aside from this, there is among educated and thoughtful colored men
\par in all parts of the land a feeling of deep regret, sorrow, and
\par apprehension at the wide currency and ascendancy which some of Mr.
\par Washington's theories have gained.  These same men admire his sincerity
\par of purpose, and are willing to forgive much to honest endeavor which is
\par doing something worth the doing.  They cooperate with Mr. Washington as
\par far as they conscientiously can; and, indeed, it is no ordinary tribute
\par to this man's tact and power that, steering as he must between so many
\par diverse interests and opinions, he so largely retains the respect of
\par all.
\par 
\par But the hushing of the criticism of honest opponents is a dangerous
\par thing.  It leads some of the best of the critics to unfortunate silence
\par and paralysis of effort, and others to burst into speech so
\par passionately and intemperately as to lose listeners.  Honest and
\par earnest criticism from those whose interests are most nearly
\par touched,--criticism of writers by readers,--this is the soul of
\par democracy and the safeguard of modern society.  If the best of the
\par American Negroes receive by outer pressure a leader whom they had not
\par recognized before, manifestly there is here a certain palpable gain.
\par Yet there is also irreparable loss,--a loss of that peculiarly valuable
\par education which a group receives when by search and criticism it finds
\par and commissions its own leaders.  The way in which this is done is at
\par once the most elementary and the nicest problem of social growth.
\par History is but the record of such group-leadership; and yet how
\par infinitely changeful is its type and character!  And of all types and
\par kinds, what can be more instructive than the leadership of a group
\par within a group?--that curious double movement where real progress may
\par be negative and actual advance be relative retrogression.  All this is
\par the social student's inspiration and despair.
\par 
\par Now in the past the American Negro has had instructive experience in
\par the choosing of group leaders, founding thus a peculiar dynasty which
\par in the light of present conditions is worth while studying.  When
\par sticks and stones and beasts form the sole environment of a people,
\par their attitude is largely one of determined opposition to and conquest
\par of natural forces.  But when to earth and brute is added an environment
\par of men and ideas, then the attitude of the imprisoned group may take
\par three main forms,--a feeling of revolt and revenge; an attempt to
\par adjust all thought and action to the will of the greater group; or,
\par finally, a determined effort at self-realization and self-development
\par despite environing opinion.  The influence of all of these attitudes at
\par various times can be traced in the history of the American Negro, and
\par in the evolution of his successive leaders.
\par 
\par Before 1750, while the fire of African freedom still burned in the
\par veins of the slaves, there was in all leadership or attempted
\par leadership but the one motive of revolt and revenge,--typified in the
\par terrible Maroons, the Danish blacks, and Cato of Stono, and veiling all
\par the Americas in fear of insurrection.  The liberalizing tendencies of
\par the latter half of the eighteenth century brought, along with kindlier
\par relations between black and white, thoughts of ultimate adjustment and
\par assimilation.  Such aspiration was especially voiced in the earnest
\par songs of Phyllis, in the martyrdom of Attucks, the fighting of Salem
\par and Poor, the intellectual accomplishments of Banneker and Derham, and
\par the political demands of the Cuffes.
\par 
\par Stern financial and social stress after the war cooled much of the
\par previous humanitarian ardor.  The disappointment and impatience of the
\par Negroes at the persistence of slavery and serfdom voiced itself in two
\par movements.  The slaves in the South, aroused undoubtedly by vague
\par rumors of the Haytian revolt, made three fierce attempts at
\par insurrection,--in 1800 under Gabriel in Virginia, in 1822 under Vesey
\par in Carolina, and in 1831 again in Virginia under the terrible Nat
\par Turner.  In the Free States, on the other hand, a new and curious
\par attempt at self-development was made.  In Philadelphia and New York
\par color-prescription led to a withdrawal of Negro communicants from white
\par churches and the formation of a peculiar socio-religious institution
\par among the Negroes known as the African Church,--an organization still
\par living and controlling in its various branches over a million of men.
\par 
\par Walker's wild appeal against the trend of the times showed how the
\par world was changing after the coming of the cotton-gin.  By 1830 slavery
\par seemed hopelessly fastened on the South, and the slaves thoroughly
\par cowed into submission.  The free Negroes of the North, inspired by the
\par mulatto immigrants from the West Indies, began to change the basis of
\par their demands; they recognized the slavery of slaves, but insisted that
\par they themselves were freemen, and sought assimilation and amalgamation
\par with the nation on the same terms with other men.  Thus, Forten and
\par Purvis of Philadelphia, Shad of Wilmington, Du Bois of New Haven,
\par Barbadoes of Boston, and others, strove singly and together as men,
\par they said, not as slaves; as "people of color," not as "Negroes."  The
\par trend of the times, however, refused them recognition save in
\par individual and exceptional cases, considered them as one with all the
\par despised blacks, and they soon found themselves striving to keep even
\par the rights they formerly had of voting and working and moving as
\par freemen.  Schemes of migration and colonization arose among them; but
\par these they refused to entertain, and they eventually turned to the
\par Abolition movement as a final refuge.
\par 
\par Here, led by Remond, Nell, Wells-Brown, and Douglass, a new period of
\par self-assertion and self-development dawned.  To be sure, ultimate
\par freedom and assimilation was the ideal before the leaders, but the
\par assertion of the manhood rights of the Negro by himself was the main
\par reliance, and John Brown's raid was the extreme of its logic.  After
\par the war and emancipation, the great form of Frederick Douglass, the
\par greatest of American Negro leaders, still led the host.
\par Self-assertion, especially in political lines, was the main programme,
\par and behind Douglass came Elliot, Bruce, and Langston, and the
\par Reconstruction politicians, and, less conspicuous but of greater social
\par significance, Alexander Crummell and Bishop Daniel Payne.
\par 
\par Then came the Revolution of 1876, the suppression of the Negro votes,
\par the changing and shifting of ideals, and the seeking of new lights in
\par the great night.  Douglass, in his old age, still bravely stood for the
\par ideals of his early manhood,--ultimate assimilation through
\par self-assertion, and on no other terms.  For a time Price arose as a new
\par leader, destined, it seemed, not to give up, but to re-state the old
\par ideals in a form less repugnant to the white South.  But he passed away
\par in his prime.  Then came the new leader.  Nearly all the former ones
\par had become leaders by the silent suffrage of their fellows, had sought
\par to lead their own people alone, and were usually, save Douglass, little
\par known outside their race.  But Booker T. Washington arose as
\par essentially the leader not of one race but of two,--a compromiser
\par between the South, the North, and the Negro.  Naturally the Negroes
\par resented, at first bitterly, signs of compromise which surrendered
\par their civil and political rights, even though this was to be exchanged
\par for larger chances of economic development.  The rich and dominating
\par North, however, was not only weary of the race problem, but was
\par investing largely in Southern enterprises, and welcomed any method of
\par peaceful cooperation.  Thus, by national opinion, the Negroes began to
\par recognize Mr. Washington's leadership; and the voice of criticism was
\par hushed.
\par 
\par Mr. Washington represents in Negro thought the old attitude of
\par adjustment and submission; but adjustment at such a peculiar time as to
\par make his programme unique.  This is an age of unusual economic
\par development, and Mr. Washington's programme naturally takes an economic
\par cast, becoming a gospel of Work and Money to such an extent as
\par apparently almost completely to overshadow the higher aims of life.
\par Moreover, this is an age when the more advanced races are coming in
\par closer contact with the less developed races, and the race-feeling is
\par therefore intensified; and Mr. Washington's programme practically
\par accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races.  Again, in our own
\par land, the reaction from the sentiment of war time has given impetus to
\par race-prejudice against Negroes, and Mr. Washington withdraws many of
\par the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.  In other
\par periods of intensified prejudice all the Negro's tendency to
\par self-assertion has been called forth; at this period a policy of
\par submission is advocated.  In the history of nearly all other races and
\par peoples the doctrine preached at such crises has been that manly
\par self-respect is worth more than lands and houses, and that a people who
\par voluntarily surrender such respect, or cease striving for it, are not
\par worth civilizing.
\par 
\par In answer to this, it has been claimed that the Negro can survive only
\par through submission.  Mr. Washington distinctly asks that black people
\par give up, at least for the present, three things,--
\par 
\par First, political power,
\par 
\par Second, insistence on civil rights,
\par 
\par Third, higher education of Negro youth,--and concentrate all their
\par energies on industrial education, and accumulation of wealth, and the
\par conciliation of the South.  This policy has been courageously and
\par insistently advocated for over fifteen years, and has been triumphant
\par for perhaps ten years.  As a result of this tender of the palm-branch,
\par what has been the return?  In these years there have occurred:
\par 
\par 1.  The disfranchisement of the Negro.
\par 
\par 2.  The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for
\par the Negro.
\par 
\par 3.  The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher
\par training of the Negro.
\par 
\par These movements are not, to be sure, direct results of Mr. Washington's
\par teachings; but his propaganda has, without a shadow of doubt, helped
\par their speedier accomplishment.  The question then comes: Is it
\par possible, and probable, that nine millions of men can make effective
\par progress in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights,
\par made a servile caste, and allowed only the most meagre chance for
\par developing their exceptional men?  If history and reason give any
\par distinct answer to these questions, it is an emphatic NO.  And Mr.
\par Washington thus faces the triple paradox of his career:
\par 
\par 1.  He is striving nobly to make Negro artisans business men and
\par property-owners; but it is utterly impossible, under modern competitive
\par methods, for workingmen and property-owners to defend their rights and
\par exist without the right of suffrage.
\par 
\par 2.  He insists on thrift and self-respect, but at the same time
\par counsels a silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to
\par sap the manhood of any race in the long run.
\par 
\par 3.  He advocates common-school and industrial training, and depreciates
\par institutions of higher learning; but neither the Negro common-schools,
\par nor Tuskegee itself, could remain open a day were it not for teachers
\par trained in Negro colleges, or trained by their graduates.
\par 
\par This triple paradox in Mr. Washington's position is the object of
\par criticism by two classes of colored Americans.  One class is
\par spiritually descended from Toussaint the Savior, through Gabriel,
\par Vesey, and Turner, and they represent the attitude of revolt and
\par revenge; they hate the white South blindly and distrust the white race
\par generally, and so far as they agree on definite action, think that the
\par Negro's only hope lies in emigration beyond the borders of the United
\par States.  And yet, by the irony of fate, nothing has more effectually
\par made this programme seem hopeless than the recent course of the United
\par States toward weaker and darker peoples in the West Indies, Hawaii, and
\par the Philippines,--for where in the world may we go and be safe from
\par lying and brute force?
\par 
\par The other class of Negroes who cannot agree with Mr. Washington has
\par hitherto said little aloud.  They deprecate the sight of scattered
\par counsels, of internal disagreement; and especially they dislike making
\par their just criticism of a useful and earnest man an excuse for a
\par general discharge of venom from small-minded opponents.  Nevertheless,
\par the questions involved are so fundamental and serious that it is
\par difficult to see how men like the Grimkes, Kelly Miller, J. W. E.
\par Bowen, and other representatives of this group, can much longer be
\par silent.  Such men feel in conscience bound to ask of this nation three
\par things:
\par 
\par 1.  The right to vote.
\par 
\par 2.  Civic equality.
\par 
\par 3.  The education of youth according to ability.  They acknowledge Mr.
\par Washington's invaluable service in counselling patience and courtesy in
\par such demands; they do not ask that ignorant black men vote when
\par ignorant whites are debarred, or that any reasonable restrictions in
\par the suffrage should not be applied; they know that the low social level
\par of the mass of the race is responsible for much discrimination against
\par it, but they also know, and the nation knows, that relentless
\par color-prejudice is more often a cause than a result of the Negro's
\par degradation; they seek the abatement of this relic of barbarism, and
\par not its systematic encouragement and pampering by all agencies of
\par social power from the Associated Press to the Church of Christ.  They
\par advocate, with Mr. Washington, a broad system of Negro common schools
\par supplemented by thorough industrial training; but they are surprised
\par that a man of Mr. Washington's insight cannot see that no such
\par educational system ever has rested or can rest on any other basis than
\par that of the well-equipped college and university, and they insist that
\par there is a demand for a few such institutions throughout the South to
\par train the best of the Negro youth as teachers, professional men, and
\par leaders.
\par 
\par This group of men honor Mr. Washington for his attitude of conciliation
\par toward the white South; they accept the "Atlanta Compromise" in its
\par broadest interpretation; they recognize, with him, many signs of
\par promise, many men of high purpose and fair judgment, in this section;
\par they know that no easy task has been laid upon a region already
\par tottering under heavy burdens.  But, nevertheless, they insist that the
\par way to truth and right lies in straightforward honesty, not in
\par indiscriminate flattery; in praising those of the South who do well and
\par criticising uncompromisingly those who do ill; in taking advantage of
\par the opportunities at hand and urging their fellows to do the same, but
\par at the same time in remembering that only a firm adherence to their
\par higher ideals and aspirations will ever keep those ideals within the
\par realm of possibility.  They do not expect that the free right to vote,
\par to enjoy civic rights, and to be educated, will come in a moment; they
\par do not expect to see the bias and prejudices of years disappear at the
\par blast of a trumpet; but they are absolutely certain that the way for a
\par people to gain their reasonable rights is not by voluntarily throwing
\par them away and insisting that they do not want them; that the way for a
\par people to gain respect is not by continually belittling and ridiculing
\par themselves; that, on the contrary, Negroes must insist continually, in
\par season and out of season, that voting is necessary to modern manhood,
\par that color discrimination is barbarism, and that black boys need
\par education as well as white boys.
\par 
\par In failing thus to state plainly and unequivocally the legitimate
\par demands of their people, even at the cost of opposing an honored
\par leader, the thinking classes of American Negroes would shirk a heavy
\par responsibility,--a responsibility to themselves, a responsibility to
\par the struggling masses, a responsibility to the darker races of men
\par whose future depends so largely on this American experiment, but
\par especially a responsibility to this nation,--this common Fatherland.
\par It is wrong to encourage a man or a people in evil-doing; it is wrong
\par to aid and abet a national crime simply because it is unpopular not to
\par do so.  The growing spirit of kindliness and reconciliation between the
\par North and South after the frightful difference of a generation ago
\par ought to be a source of deep congratulation to all, and especially to
\par those whose mistreatment caused the war; but if that reconciliation is
\par to be marked by the industrial slavery and civic death of those same
\par black men, with permanent legislation into a position of inferiority,
\par then those black men, if they are really men, are called upon by every
\par consideration of patriotism and loyalty to oppose such a course by all
\par civilized methods, even though such opposition involves disagreement
\par with Mr. Booker T. Washington.  We have no right to sit silently by
\par while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our
\par children, black and white.
\par 
\par First, it is the duty of black men to judge the South discriminatingly.
\par The present generation of Southerners are not responsible for the past,
\par and they should not be blindly hated or blamed for it.  Furthermore, to
\par no class is the indiscriminate endorsement of the recent course of the
\par South toward Negroes more nauseating than to the best thought of the
\par South.  The South is not "solid"; it is a land in the ferment of social
\par change, wherein forces of all kinds are fighting for supremacy; and to
\par praise the ill the South is today perpetrating is just as wrong as to
\par condemn the good.  Discriminating and broad-minded criticism is what
\par the South needs,--needs it for the sake of her own white sons and
\par daughters, and for the insurance of robust, healthy mental and moral
\par development.
\par 
\par Today even the attitude of the Southern whites toward the blacks is
\par not, as so many assume, in all cases the same; the ignorant Southerner
\par hates the Negro, the workingmen fear his competition, the money-makers
\par wish to use him as a laborer, some of the educated see a menace in his
\par upward development, while others--usually the sons of the masters--wish
\par to help him to rise.  National opinion has enabled this last class to
\par maintain the Negro common schools, and to protect the Negro partially
\par in property, life, and limb.  Through the pressure of the money-makers,
\par the Negro is in danger of being reduced to semi-slavery, especially in
\par the country districts; the workingmen, and those of the educated who
\par fear the Negro, have united to disfranchise him, and some have urged
\par his deportation; while the passions of the ignorant are easily aroused
\par to lynch and abuse any black man.  To praise this intricate whirl of
\par thought and prejudice is nonsense; to inveigh indiscriminately against
\par "the South" is unjust; but to use the same breath in praising Governor
\par Aycock, exposing Senator Morgan, arguing with Mr. Thomas Nelson Page,
\par and denouncing Senator Ben Tillman, is not only sane, but the
\par imperative duty of thinking black men.
\par 
\par It would be unjust to Mr. Washington not to acknowledge that in several
\par instances he has opposed movements in the South which were unjust to
\par the Negro; he sent memorials to the Louisiana and Alabama
\par constitutional conventions, he has spoken against lynching, and in
\par other ways has openly or silently set his influence against sinister
\par schemes and unfortunate happenings.  Notwithstanding this, it is
\par equally true to assert that on the whole the distinct impression left
\par by Mr. Washington's propaganda is, first, that the South is justified
\par in its present attitude toward the Negro because of the Negro's
\par degradation; secondly, that the prime cause of the Negro's failure to
\par rise more quickly is his wrong education in the past; and, thirdly,
\par that his future rise depends primarily on his own efforts.  Each of
\par these propositions is a dangerous half-truth.  The supplementary truths
\par must never be lost sight of: first, slavery and race-prejudice are
\par potent if not sufficient causes of the Negro's position; second,
\par industrial and common-school training were necessarily slow in planting
\par because they had to await the black teachers trained by higher
\par institutions,--it being extremely doubtful if any essentially different
\par development was possible, and certainly a Tuskegee was unthinkable
\par before 1880; and, third, while it is a great truth to say that the
\par Negro must strive and strive mightily to help himself, it is equally
\par true that unless his striving be not simply seconded, but rather
\par aroused and encouraged, by the initiative of the richer and wiser
\par environing group, he cannot hope for great success.
\par 
\par In his failure to realize and impress this last point, Mr. Washington
\par is especially to be criticised.  His doctrine has tended to make the
\par whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the
\par Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic
\par spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the
\par hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting
\par these great wrongs.
\par 
\par The South ought to be led, by candid and honest criticism, to assert
\par her better self and do her full duty to the race she has cruelly
\par wronged and is still wronging.  The North--her co-partner in
\par guilt--cannot salve her conscience by plastering it with gold.  We
\par cannot settle this problem by diplomacy and suaveness, by "policy"
\par alone.  If worse come to worst, can the moral fibre of this country
\par survive the slow throttling and murder of nine millions of men?
\par 
\par The black men of America have a duty to perform, a duty stern and
\par delicate,--a forward movement to oppose a part of the work of their
\par greatest leader.  So far as Mr. Washington preaches Thrift, Patience,
\par and Industrial Training for the masses, we must hold up his hands and
\par strive with him, rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength
\par of this Joshua called of God and of man to lead the headless host.  But
\par so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does
\par not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, belittles the
\par emasculating effects of caste distinctions, and opposes the higher
\par training and ambition of our brighter minds,--so far as he, the South,
\par or the Nation, does this,--we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.
\par By every civilized and peaceful method we must strive for the rights
\par which the world accords to men, clinging unwaveringly to those great
\par words which the sons of the Fathers would fain forget: "We hold these
\par truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they
\par are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
\par among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

\par   Willst Du Deine Macht verkunden,

\par   Nicht die zarte Jungfrau wahle,
\par   Nicht der Hirtin weiche Seele!

\par   SCHILLER.
\par 
\par 
\par Once upon a time I taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the
\par broad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet
\par the Alleghanies.  I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought
\par that Tennessee--beyond the Veil--was theirs alone, and in vacation time
\par they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county
\par school-commissioners.  Young and happy, I too went, and I shall not
\par soon forget that summer, seventeen years ago.
\par 
\par First, there was a Teachers' Institute at the county-seat; and there
\par distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers
\par fractions and spelling and other mysteries,--white teachers in the
\par morning, Negroes at night.  A picnic now and then, and a supper, and
\par the rough world was softened by laughter and song.  I remember how--
\par But I wander.
\par 
\par There came a day when all the teachers left the Institute and began the
\par hunt for schools.  I learn from hearsay (for my mother was mortally
\par afraid of firearms) that the hunting of ducks and bears and men is
\par wonderfully interesting, but I am sure that the man who has never
\par hunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the
\par chase.  I see now the white, hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind
\par before me under the burning July sun; I feel the deep weariness of
\par heart and limb as ten, eight, six miles stretch relentlessly ahead; I
\par feel my heart sink heavily as I hear again and again, "Got a teacher?
\par Yes."  So I walked on and on--horses were too expensive--until I had
\par wandered beyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a land of "varmints"
\par and rattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men
\par lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill.
\par 
\par Sprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses, shut out from
\par the world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east.  There
\par I found at last a little school.  Josie told me of it; she was a thin,
\par homely girl of twenty, with a dark-brown face and thick, hard hair.  I
\par had crossed the stream at Watertown, and rested under the great
\par willows; then I had gone to the little cabin in the lot where Josie was
\par resting on her way to town.  The gaunt farmer made me welcome, and
\par Josie, hearing my errand, told me anxiously that they wanted a school
\par over the hill; that but once since the war had a teacher been there;
\par that she herself longed to learn,--and thus she ran on, talking fast
\par and loud, with much earnestness and energy.
\par 
\par Next morning I crossed the tall round hill, lingered to look at the
\par blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the Carolinas, then plunged
\par into the wood, and came out at Josie's home.  It was a dull frame
\par cottage with four rooms, perched just below the brow of the hill, amid
\par peach-trees.  The father was a quiet, simple soul, calmly ignorant,
\par with no touch of vulgarity.  The mother was different,--strong,
\par bustling, and energetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an ambition
\par to live "like folks." There was a crowd of children.  Two boys had gone
\par away.  There remained two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; John,
\par tall, awkward, and eighteen; Jim, younger, quicker, and better looking;
\par and two babies of indefinite age.  Then there was Josie herself.  She
\par seemed to be the centre of the family: always busy at service, or at
\par home, or berry-picking; a little nervous and inclined to scold, like
\par her mother, yet faithful, too, like her father.  She had about her a
\par certain fineness, the shadow of an unconscious moral heroism that would
\par willingly give all of life to make life broader, deeper, and fuller for
\par her and hers.  I saw much of this family afterwards, and grew to love
\par them for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable, and for
\par their knowledge of their own ignorance.  There was with them no
\par affectation.  The mother would scold the father for being so "easy";
\par Josie would roundly berate the boys for carelessness; and all knew that
\par it was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky side-hill.
\par 
\par I secured the school.  I remember the day I rode horseback out to the
\par commissioner's house with a pleasant young white fellow who wanted the
\par white school.  The road ran down the bed of a stream; the sun laughed
\par and the water jingled, and we rode on.  "Come in," said the
\par commissioner,--"come in.  Have a seat.  Yes, that certificate will do.
\par Stay to dinner.  What do you want a month?"  "Oh," thought I, "this is
\par lucky"; but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate
\par first, then I--alone.
\par 
\par The schoolhouse was a log hut, where Colonel Wheeler used to shelter
\par his corn.  It sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes, near
\par the sweetest of springs.  There was an entrance where a door once was,
\par and within, a massive rickety fireplace; great chinks between the logs
\par served as windows.  Furniture was scarce.  A pale blackboard crouched
\par in the corner.  My desk was made of three boards, reinforced at
\par critical points, and my chair, borrowed from the landlady, had to be
\par returned every night.  Seats for the children--these puzzled me much.
\par I was haunted by a New England vision of neat little desks and chairs,
\par but, alas! the reality was rough plank benches without backs, and at
\par times without legs.  They had the one virtue of making naps
\par dangerous,--possibly fatal, for the floor was not to be trusted.
\par 
\par It was a hot morning late in July when the school opened.  I trembled
\par when I heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road, and saw the
\par growing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager eyes facing me.
\par First came Josie and her brothers and sisters.  The longing to know, to
\par be a student in the great school at Nashville, hovered like a star
\par above this child-woman amid her work and worry, and she studied
\par doggedly.  There were the Dowells from their farm over toward
\par Alexandria,--Fanny, with her smooth black face and wondering eyes;
\par Martha, brown and dull; the pretty girl-wife of a brother, and the
\par younger brood.
\par 
\par There were the Burkes,--two brown and yellow lads, and a tiny
\par haughty-eyed girl.  Fat Reuben's little chubby girl came, with golden
\par face and old-gold hair, faithful and solemn.  'Thenie was on hand
\par early,--a jolly, ugly, good-hearted girl, who slyly dipped snuff and
\par looked after her little bow-legged brother.  When her mother could
\par spare her, 'Tildy came,--a midnight beauty, with starry eyes and
\par tapering limbs; and her brother, correspondingly homely.  And then the
\par big boys,--the hulking Lawrences; the lazy Neills, unfathered sons of
\par mother and daughter; Hickman, with a stoop in his shoulders; and the
\par rest.
\par 
\par There they sat, nearly thirty of them, on the rough benches, their
\par faces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown, the little feet bare
\par and swinging, the eyes full of expectation, with here and there a
\par twinkle of mischief, and the hands grasping Webster's blue-black
\par spelling-book.  I loved my school, and the fine faith the children had
\par in the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvellous.  We read and
\par spelled together, wrote a little, picked flowers, sang, and listened to
\par stories of the world beyond the hill.  At times the school would
\par dwindle away, and I would start out.  I would visit Mun Eddings, who
\par lived in two very dirty rooms, and ask why little Lugene, whose flaming
\par face seemed ever ablaze with the dark-red hair uncombed, was absent all
\par last week, or why I missed so often the inimitable rags of Mack and Ed.
\par Then the father, who worked Colonel Wheeler's farm on shares, would
\par tell me how the crops needed the boys; and the thin, slovenly mother,
\par whose face was pretty when washed, assured me that Lugene must mind the
\par baby.  "But we'll start them again next week."  When the Lawrences
\par stopped, I knew that the doubts of the old folks about book-learning
\par had conquered again, and so, toiling up the hill, and getting as far
\par into the cabin as possible, I put Cicero "pro Archia Poeta" into the
\par simplest English with local applications, and usually convinced
\par them--for a week or so.
\par 
\par On Friday nights I often went home with some of the
\par children,--sometimes to Doc Burke's farm.  He was a great, loud, thin
\par Black, ever working, and trying to buy the seventy-five acres of hill
\par and dale where he lived; but people said that he would surely fail, and
\par the "white folks would get it all."  His wife was a magnificent Amazon,
\par with saffron face and shining hair, uncorseted and barefooted, and the
\par children were strong and beautiful.  They lived in a
\par one-and-a-half-room cabin in the hollow of the farm, near the spring.
\par The front room was full of great fat white beds, scrupulously neat; and
\par there were bad chromos on the walls, and a tired centre-table.  In the
\par tiny back kitchen I was often invited to "take out and help" myself to
\par fried chicken and wheat biscuit, "meat" and corn pone, string-beans and
\par berries.  At first I used to be a little alarmed at the approach of
\par bedtime in the one lone bedroom, but embarrassment was very deftly
\par avoided.  First, all the children nodded and slept, and were stowed
\par away in one great pile of goose feathers; next, the mother and the
\par father discreetly slipped away to the kitchen while I went to bed;
\par then, blowing out the dim light, they retired in the dark.  In the
\par morning all were up and away before I thought of awaking.  Across the
\par road, where fat Reuben lived, they all went outdoors while the teacher
\par retired, because they did not boast the luxury of a kitchen.
\par 
\par I liked to stay with the Dowells, for they had four rooms and plenty of
\par good country fare.  Uncle Bird had a small, rough farm, all woods and
\par hills, miles from the big road; but he was full of tales,--he preached
\par now and then,--and with his children, berries, horses, and wheat he was
\par happy and prosperous.  Often, to keep the peace, I must go where life
\par was less lovely; for instance, 'Tildy's mother was incorrigibly dirty,
\par Reuben's larder was limited seriously, and herds of untamed insects
\par wandered over the Eddingses' beds.  Best of all I loved to go to
\par Josie's, and sit on the porch, eating peaches, while the mother bustled
\par and talked: how Josie had bought the sewing-machine; how Josie worked
\par at service in winter, but that four dollars a month was "mighty little"
\par wages; how Josie longed to go away to school, but that it "looked like"
\par they never could get far enough ahead to let her; how the crops failed
\par and the well was yet unfinished; and, finally, how "mean" some of the
\par white folks were.
\par 
\par For two summers I lived in this little world; it was dull and humdrum.
\par The girls looked at the hill in wistful longing, and the boys fretted
\par and haunted Alexandria.  Alexandria was "town,"--a straggling, lazy
\par village of houses, churches, and shops, and an aristocracy of Toms,
\par Dicks, and Captains.  Cuddled on the hill to the north was the village
\par of the colored folks, who lived in three- or four-room unpainted
\par cottages, some neat and homelike, and some dirty.  The dwellings were
\par scattered rather aimlessly, but they centred about the twin temples of
\par the hamlet, the Methodist, and the Hard-Shell Baptist churches.  These,
\par in turn, leaned gingerly on a sad-colored schoolhouse.  Hither my
\par little world wended its crooked way on Sunday to meet other worlds, and
\par gossip, and wonder, and make the weekly sacrifice with frenzied priest
\par at the altar of the "old-time religion."  Then the soft melody and
\par mighty cadences of Negro song fluttered and thundered.
\par 
\par I have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it;
\par and yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness,
\par sprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a
\par common hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all,
\par from the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity.  All
\par this caused us to think some thoughts together; but these, when ripe
\par for speech, were spoken in various languages.  Those whose eyes
\par twenty-five and more years before had seen "the glory of the coming of
\par the Lord," saw in every present hindrance or help a dark fatalism bound
\par to bring all things right in His own good time.  The mass of those to
\par whom slavery was a dim recollection of childhood found the world a
\par puzzling thing: it asked little of them, and they answered with little,
\par and yet it ridiculed their offering.  Such a paradox they could not
\par understand, and therefore sank into listless indifference, or
\par shiftlessness, or reckless bravado.  There were, however, some--such as
\par Josie, Jim, and Ben--to whom War, Hell, and Slavery were but childhood
\par tales, whose young appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and
\par story and half-awakened thought.  Ill could they be content, born
\par without and beyond the World.  And their weak wings beat against their
\par barriers,--barriers of caste, of youth, of life; at last, in dangerous
\par moments, against everything that opposed even a whim.
\par 
\par 
\par The ten years that follow youth, the years when first the realization
\par comes that life is leading somewhere,--these were the years that passed
\par after I left my little school.  When they were past, I came by chance
\par once more to the walls of Fisk University, to the halls of the chapel
\par of melody.  As I lingered there in the joy and pain of meeting old
\par school-friends, there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again
\par beyond the blue hill, and to see the homes and the school of other
\par days, and to learn how life had gone with my school-children; and I
\par went.
\par 
\par Josie was dead, and the gray-haired mother said simply, "We've had a
\par heap of trouble since you've been away."  I had feared for Jim.  With a
\par cultured parentage and a social caste to uphold him, he might have made
\par a venturesome merchant or a West Point cadet.  But here he was, angry
\par with life and reckless; and when Fanner Durham charged him with
\par stealing wheat, the old man had to ride fast to escape the stones which
\par the furious fool hurled after him.  They told Jim to run away; but he
\par would not run, and the constable came that afternoon.  It grieved
\par Josie, and great awkward John walked nine miles every day to see his
\par little brother through the bars of Lebanon jail.  At last the two came
\par back together in the dark night.  The mother cooked supper, and Josie
\par emptied her purse, and the boys stole away.  Josie grew thin and
\par silent, yet worked the more.  The hill became steep for the quiet old
\par father, and with the boys away there was little to do in the valley.
\par Josie helped them to sell the old farm, and they moved nearer town.
\par Brother Dennis, the carpenter, built a new house with six rooms; Josie
\par toiled a year in Nashville, and brought back ninety dollars to furnish
\par the house and change it to a home.
\par 
\par When the spring came, and the birds twittered, and the stream ran proud
\par and full, little sister Lizzie, bold and thoughtless, flushed with the
\par passion of youth, bestowed herself on the tempter, and brought home a
\par nameless child.  Josie shivered and worked on, with the vision of
\par schooldays all fled, with a face wan and tired,--worked until, on a
\par summer's day, some one married another; then Josie crept to her mother
\par like a hurt child, and slept--and sleeps.
\par 
\par I paused to scent the breeze as I entered the valley.  The Lawrences
\par have gone,--father and son forever,--and the other son lazily digs in
\par the earth to live.  A new young widow rents out their cabin to fat
\par Reuben.  Reuben is a Baptist preacher now, but I fear as lazy as ever,
\par though his cabin has three rooms; and little Ella has grown into a
\par bouncing woman, and is ploughing corn on the hot hillside.  There are
\par babies a-plenty, and one half-witted girl.  Across the valley is a
\par house I did not know before, and there I found, rocking one baby and
\par expecting another, one of my schoolgirls, a daughter of Uncle Bird
\par Dowell.  She looked somewhat worried with her new duties, but soon
\par bristled into pride over her neat cabin and the tale of her thrifty
\par husband, and the horse and cow, and the farm they were planning to buy.
\par 
\par My log schoolhouse was gone.  In its place stood Progress; and
\par Progress, I understand, is necessarily ugly.  The crazy foundation
\par stones still marked the former site of my poor little cabin, and not
\par far away, on six weary boulders, perched a jaunty board house, perhaps
\par twenty by thirty feet, with three windows and a door that locked.  Some
\par of the window-glass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay
\par mournfully under the house.  I peeped through the window half
\par reverently, and found things that were more familiar.  The blackboard
\par had grown by about two feet, and the seats were still without backs.
\par The county owns the lot now, I hear, and every year there is a session
\par of school.  As I sat by the spring and looked on the Old and the New I
\par felt glad, very glad, and yet--
\par 
\par After two long drinks I started on.  There was the great double
\par log-house on the corner.  I remembered the broken, blighted family that
\par used to live there.  The strong, hard face of the mother, with its
\par wilderness of hair, rose before me.  She had driven her husband away,
\par and while I taught school a strange man lived there, big and jovial,
\par and people talked.  I felt sure that Ben and 'Tildy would come to
\par naught from such a home.  But this is an odd world; for Ben is a busy
\par farmer in Smith County, "doing well, too," they say, and he had cared
\par for little 'Tildy until last spring, when a lover married her.  A hard
\par life the lad had led, toiling for meat, and laughed at because he was
\par homely and crooked.  There was Sam Carlon, an impudent old skinflint,
\par who had definite notions about "niggers," and hired Ben a summer and
\par would not pay him.  Then the hungry boy gathered his sacks together,
\par and in broad daylight went into Carlon's corn; and when the hard-fisted
\par farmer set upon him, the angry boy flew at him like a beast.  Doc Burke
\par saved a murder and a lynching that day.
\par 
\par The story reminded me again of the Burkes, and an impatience seized me
\par to know who won in the battle, Doc or the seventy-five acres.  For it
\par is a hard thing to make a farm out of nothing, even in fifteen years.
\par So I hurried on, thinking of the Burkes.  They used to have a certain
\par magnificent barbarism about them that I liked.  They were never vulgar,
\par never immoral, but rather rough and primitive, with an
\par unconventionality that spent itself in loud guffaws, slaps on the back,
\par and naps in the corner.  I hurried by the cottage of the misborn Neill
\par boys.  It was empty, and they were grown into fat, lazy farm-hands.  I
\par saw the home of the Hickmans, but Albert, with his stooping shoulders,
\par had passed from the world.  Then I came to the Burkes' gate and peered
\par through; the enclosure looked rough and untrimmed, and yet there were
\par the same fences around the old farm save to the left, where lay
\par twenty-five other acres.  And lo! the cabin in the hollow had climbed
\par the hill and swollen to a half-finished six-room cottage.
\par 
\par The Burkes held a hundred acres, but they were still in debt.  Indeed,
\par the gaunt father who toiled night and day would scarcely be happy out
\par of debt, being so used to it.  Some day he must stop, for his massive
\par frame is showing decline.  The mother wore shoes, but the lion-like
\par physique of other days was broken.  The children had grown up.  Rob,
\par the image of his father, was loud and rough with laughter.  Birdie, my
\par school baby of six, had grown to a picture of maiden beauty, tall and
\par tawny.  "Edgar is gone," said the mother, with head half bowed,--"gone
\par to work in Nashville; he and his father couldn't agree."
\par 
\par Little Doc, the boy born since the time of my school, took me horseback
\par down the creek next morning toward Farmer Dowell's.  The road and the
\par stream were battling for mastery, and the stream had the better of it.
\par We splashed and waded, and the merry boy, perched behind me, chattered
\par and laughed.  He showed me where Simon Thompson had bought a bit of
\par ground and a home; but his daughter Lana, a plump, brown, slow girl,
\par was not there.  She had married a man and a farm twenty miles away.  We
\par wound on down the stream till we came to a gate that I did not
\par recognize, but the boy insisted that it was "Uncle Bird's."  The farm
\par was fat with the growing crop.  In that little valley was a strange
\par stillness as I rode up; for death and marriage had stolen youth and
\par left age and childhood there.  We sat and talked that night after the
\par chores were done.  Uncle Bird was grayer, and his eyes did not see so
\par well, but he was still jovial.  We talked of the acres bought,--one
\par hundred and twenty-five,--of the new guest-chamber added, of Martha's
\par marrying.  Then we talked of death: Fanny and Fred were gone; a shadow
\par hung over the other daughter, and when it lifted she was to go to
\par Nashville to school.  At last we spoke of the neighbors, and as night
\par fell, Uncle Bird told me how, on a night like that, 'Thenie came
\par wandering back to her home over yonder, to escape the blows of her
\par husband.  And next morning she died in the home that her little
\par bow-legged brother, working and saving, had bought for their widowed
\par mother.
\par 
\par My journey was done, and behind me lay hill and dale, and Life and
\par Death.  How shall man measure Progress there where the dark-faced Josie
\par lies?  How many heartfuls of sorrow shall balance a bushel of wheat?
\par How hard a thing is life to the lowly, and yet how human and real!  And
\par all this life and love and strife and failure,--is it the twilight of
\par nightfall or the flush of some faint-dawning day?
\par 
\par Thus sadly musing, I rode to Nashville in the Jim Crow car.

\par Of the Wings of Atalanta
\par 
\par   O black boy of Atlanta!
\par     But half was spoken;
\par   The slave's chains and the master's
\par     Alike are broken;
\par   The one curse of the races
\par     Held both in tether;
\par   They are rising--all are rising--
\par     The black and white together.
\par 
\par   WHITTIER.
\par 
\par 
\par South of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred
\par Hills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the
\par future.  I have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day
\par had half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of
\par Georgia; then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the
\par tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and
\par roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl
\par of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.
\par 
\par Once, they say, even Atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of
\par the Alleghanies, until the iron baptism of war awakened her with its
\par sullen waters, aroused and maddened her, and left her listening to the
\par sea.  And the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea,
\par till the city rose like a widow and cast away her weeds, and toiled for
\par her daily bread; toiled steadily, toiled cunningly,--perhaps with some
\par bitterness, with a touch, of reclame,--and yet with real earnestness,
\par and real sweat.
\par 
\par It is a hard thing to live haunted by the ghost of an untrue dream; to
\par see the wide vision of empire fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel
\par the pang of the conquered, and yet know that with all the Bad that fell
\par on one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to live,
\par something killed that in justice had not dared to die; to know that
\par with the Right that triumphed, triumphed something of Wrong, something
\par sordid and mean, something less than the broadest and best.  All this
\par is bitter hard; and many a man and city and people have found in it
\par excuse for sulking, and brooding, and listless waiting.
\par 
\par Such are not men of the sturdier make; they of Atlanta turned
\par resolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of
\par purple and gold:--Atlanta, Queen of the cotton kingdom; Atlanta,
\par Gateway to the Land of the Sun; Atlanta, the new Lachesis, spinner of
\par web and woof for the world.  So the city crowned her hundred hills with
\par factories, and stored her shops with cunning handiwork, and stretched
\par long iron ways to greet the busy Mercury in his coming.  And the Nation
\par talked of her striving.
\par 
\par 
\par Perhaps Atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull
\par Boeotia; you know the tale,--how swarthy Atalanta, tall and wild, would
\par marry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily Hippomenes laid
\par three apples of gold in the way.  She fled like a shadow, paused,
\par startled over the first apple, but even as he stretched his hand, fled
\par again; hovered over the second, then, slipping from his hot grasp, flew
\par over river, vale, and hill; but as she lingered over the third, his
\par arms fell round her, and looking on each other, the blazing passion of
\par their love profaned the sanctuary of Love, and they were cursed.  If
\par Atlanta be not named for Atalanta, she ought to have been.
\par 
\par Atalanta is not the first or the last maiden whom greed of gold has led
\par to defile the temple of Love; and not maids alone, but men in the race
\par of life, sink from the high and generous ideals of youth to the
\par gambler's code of the Bourse; and in all our Nation's striving is not
\par the Gospel of Work befouled by the Gospel of Pay?  So common is this
\par that one-half think it normal; so unquestioned, that we almost fear to
\par question if the end of racing is not gold, if the aim of man is not
\par rightly to be rich.  And if this is the fault of America, how dire a
\par danger lies before a new land and a new city, lest Atlanta, stooping
\par for mere gold, shall find that gold accursed!
\par 
\par It was no maiden's idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful
\par wilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War,--feudalism,
\par poverty, the rise of the Third Estate, serfdom, the re-birth of Law and
\par Order, and above and between all, the Veil of Race.  How heavy a
\par journey for weary feet!  what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all
\par this hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the
\par red waste of sun-baked clay!  How fleet must Atalanta be if she will
\par not be tempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!
\par 
\par The Sanctuary of our fathers has, to be sure, few Gods,--some sneer,
\par "all too few."  There is the thrifty Mercury of New England, Pluto of
\par the North, and Ceres of the West; and there, too, is the half-forgotten
\par Apollo of the South, under whose aegis the maiden ran,--and as she ran
\par she forgot him, even as there in Boeotia Venus was forgot.  She forgot
\par the old ideal of the Southern gentleman,--that new-world heir of the
\par grace and courtliness of patrician, knight, and noble; forgot his honor
\par with his foibles, his kindliness with his carelessness, and stooped to
\par apples of gold,--to men busier and sharper, thriftier and more
\par unscrupulous.  Golden apples are beautiful--I remember the lawless days
\par of boyhood, when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and
\par field--and, too, the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no
\par despicable parvenu.  Work and wealth are the mighty levers to lift this
\par old new land; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes
\par and new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily
\par Hippomenes tempt Atalanta to thinking that golden apples are the goal
\par of racing, and not mere incidents by the way.
\par 
\par Atlanta must not lead the South to dream of material prosperity as the
\par touchstone of all success; already the fatal might of this idea is
\par beginning to spread; it is replacing the finer type of Southerner with
\par vulgar money-getters; it is burying the sweeter beauties of Southern
\par life beneath pretence and ostentation.  For every social ill the
\par panacea of Wealth has been urged,--wealth to overthrow the remains of
\par the slave feudalism; wealth to raise the "cracker" Third Estate; wealth
\par to employ the black serfs, and the prospect of wealth to keep them
\par working; wealth as the end and aim of politics, and as the legal tender
\par for law and order; and, finally, instead of Truth, Beauty, and
\par Goodness, wealth as the ideal of the Public School.
\par 
\par Not only is this true in the world which Atlanta typifies, but it is
\par threatening to be true of a world beneath and beyond that world,--the
\par Black World beyond the Veil.  Today it makes little difference to
\par Atlanta, to the South, what the Negro thinks or dreams or wills.  In
\par the soul-life of the land he is to-day, and naturally will long remain,
\par unthought of, half forgotten; and yet when he does come to think and
\par will and do for himself,--and let no man dream that day will never
\par come,--then the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning, but
\par words and thoughts he has been taught to lisp in his race-childhood.
\par To-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the
\par strife of the white world like a wheel within a wheel: beyond the Veil
\par are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of
\par serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the
\par Veil of Race.  Few know of these problems, few who know notice them;
\par and yet there they are, awaiting student, artist, and seer,--a field
\par for somebody sometime to discover.  Hither has the temptation of
\par Hippomenes penetrated; already in this smaller world, which now
\par indirectly and anon directly must influence the larger for good or ill,
\par the habit is forming of interpreting the world in dollars.  The old
\par leaders of Negro opinion, in the little groups where there is a Negro
\par social consciousness, are being replaced by new; neither the black
\par preacher nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago.  Into
\par their places are pushing the farmers and gardeners, the well-paid
\par porters and artisans, the business-men,--all those with property and
\par money.  And with all this change, so curiously parallel to that of the
\par Other-world, goes too the same inevitable change in ideals.  The South
\par laments to-day the slow, steady disappearance of a certain type of
\par Negro,--the faithful, courteous slave of other days, with his
\par incorruptible honesty and dignified humility.  He is passing away just
\par as surely as the old type of Southern gentleman is passing, and from
\par not dissimilar causes,--the sudden transformation of a fair far-off
\par ideal of Freedom into the hard reality of bread-winning and the
\par consequent deification of Bread.
\par 
\par In the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals
\par of this people--the strife for another and a juster world, the vague
\par dream of righteousness, the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger
\par is that these ideals, with their simple beauty and weird inspiration,
\par will suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold.  Here
\par stands this black young Atalanta, girding herself for the race that
\par must be run; and if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as in
\par the days of old, then we may look for noble running; but what if some
\par ruthless or wily or even thoughtless Hippomenes lay golden apples
\par before her?  What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife for
\par righteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-all
\par and end-all of life?  What if to the Mammonism of America be added the
\par rising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this South
\par be reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-wakened black
\par millions?  Whither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty
\par and Truth gone glimmering?  Must this, and that fair flower of Freedom
\par which, despite the jeers of latter-day striplings, sprung from our
\par fathers' blood, must that too degenerate into a dusty quest of
\par gold,--into lawless lust with Hippomenes?
\par 
\par 
\par The hundred hills of Atlanta are not all crowned with factories.  On
\par one, toward the west, the setting sun throws three buildings in bold
\par relief against the sky.  The beauty of the group lies in its simple
\par unity:--a broad lawn of green rising from the red street and mingled
\par roses and peaches; north and south, two plain and stately halls; and in
\par the midst, half hidden in ivy, a larger building, boldly graceful,
\par sparingly decorated, and with one low spire.  It is a restful group,
\par --one never looks for more; it is all here, all intelligible.  There I
\par live, and there I hear from day to day the low hum of restful life.  In
\par winter's twilight, when the red sun glows, I can see the dark figures
\par pass between the halls to the music of the night-bell.  In the morning,
\par when the sun is golden, the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and
\par laughter of three hundred young hearts from hall and street, and from
\par the busy city below,--children all dark and heavy-haired,--to join
\par their clear young voices in the music of the morning sacrifice.  In a
\par half-dozen class-rooms they gather then,--here to follow the love-song
\par of Dido, here to listen to the tale of Troy divine; there to wander
\par among the stars, there to wander among men and nations,--and elsewhere
\par other well-worn ways of knowing this queer world.  Nothing new, no
\par time-saving devices,--simply old time-glorified methods of delving for
\par Truth, and searching out the hidden beauties of life, and learning the
\par good of living.  The riddle of existence is the college curriculum that
\par was laid before the Pharaohs, that was taught in the groves by Plato,
\par that formed the trivium and quadrivium, and is to-day laid before the
\par freedmen's sons by Atlanta University.  And this course of study will
\par not change; its methods will grow more deft and effectual, its content
\par richer by toil of scholar and sight of seer; but the true college will
\par ever have one goal,--not to earn meat, but to know the end and aim of
\par that life which meat nourishes.
\par 
\par The vision of life that rises before these dark eyes has in it nothing
\par mean or selfish.  Not at Oxford or at Leipsic, not at Yale or Columbia,
\par is there an air of higher resolve or more unfettered striving; the
\par determination to realize for men, both black and white, the broadest
\par possibilities of life, to seek the better and the best, to spread with
\par their own hands the Gospel of Sacrifice,--all this is the burden of
\par their talk and dream.  Here, amid a wide desert of caste and
\par proscription, amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a
\par deep race-dislike, lies this green oasis, where hot anger cools, and
\par the bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and
\par breezes of Parnassus; and here men may lie and listen, and learn of a
\par future fuller than the past, and hear the voice of Time:
\par 
\par   "Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren."
\par 
\par 
\par They made their mistakes, those who planted Fisk and Howard and Atlanta
\par before the smoke of battle had lifted; they made their mistakes, but
\par those mistakes were not the things at which we lately laughed somewhat
\par uproariously.  They were right when they sought to found a new
\par educational system upon the University: where, forsooth, shall we
\par ground knowledge save on the broadest and deepest knowledge?  The roots
\par of the tree, rather than the leaves, are the sources of its life; and
\par from the dawn of history, from Academus to Cambridge, the culture of
\par the University has been the broad foundation-stone on which is built
\par the kindergarten's A B C.
\par 
\par But these builders did make a mistake in minimizing the gravity of the
\par problem before them; in thinking it a matter of years and decades; in
\par therefore building quickly and laying their foundation carelessly, and
\par lowering the standard of knowing, until they had scattered haphazard
\par through the South some dozen poorly equipped high schools and miscalled
\par them universities.  They forgot, too, just as their successors are
\par forgetting, the rule of inequality:--that of the million black youth,
\par some were fitted to know and some to dig; that some had the talent and
\par capacity of university men, and some the talent and capacity of
\par blacksmiths; and that true training meant neither that all should be
\par college men nor all artisans, but that the one should be made a
\par missionary of culture to an untaught people, and the other a free
\par workman among serfs.  And to seek to make the blacksmith a scholar is
\par almost as silly as the more modern scheme of making the scholar a
\par blacksmith; almost, but not quite.
\par 
\par 
\par The function of the university is not simply to teach bread-winning, or
\par to furnish teachers for the public schools or to be a centre of polite
\par society; it is, above all, to be the organ of that fine adjustment
\par between real life and the growing knowledge of life, an adjustment
\par which forms the secret of civilization.  Such an institution the South
\par of to-day sorely needs.  She has religion, earnest, bigoted:--religion
\par that on both sides the Veil often omits the sixth, seventh, and eighth
\par commandments, but substitutes a dozen supplementary ones.  She has, as
\par Atlanta shows, growing thrift and love of toil; but she lacks that
\par broad knowledge of what the world knows and knew of human living and
\par doing, which she may apply to the thousand problems of real life to-day
\par confronting her.  The need of the South is knowledge and culture,--not
\par in dainty limited quantity, as before the war, but in broad busy
\par abundance in the world of work; and until she has this, not all the
\par Apples of Hesperides, be they golden and bejewelled, can save her from
\par the curse of the Boeotian lovers.
\par 
\par The Wings of Atalanta are the coming universities of the South.  They
\par alone can bear the maiden past the temptation of golden fruit.  They
\par will not guide her flying feet away from the cotton and gold; for--ah,
\par thoughtful Hippomenes!--do not the apples lie in the very Way of Life?
\par But they will guide her over and beyond them, and leave her kneeling in
\par the Sanctuary of Truth and Freedom and broad Humanity, virgin and
\par undefiled.  Sadly did the Old South err in human education, despising
\par the education of the masses, and niggardly in the support of colleges.
\par Her ancient university foundations dwindled and withered under the foul
\par breath of slavery; and even since the war they have fought a failing
\par fight for life in the tainted air of social unrest and commercial
\par selfishness, stunted by the death of criticism, and starving for lack
\par of broadly cultured men.  And if this is the white South's need and
\par danger, how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen's sons!
\par how pressing here the need of broad ideals and true culture, the
\par conservation of soul from sordid aims and petty passions!  Let us build
\par the Southern university--William and Mary, Trinity, Georgia, Texas,
\par Tulane, Vanderbilt, and the others--fit to live; let us build, too, the
\par Negro universities:--Fisk, whose foundation was ever broad; Howard, at
\par the heart of the Nation; Atlanta at Atlanta, whose ideal of scholarship
\par has been held above the temptation of numbers.  Why not here, and
\par perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time centres of learning
\par and living, colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South
\par a few white men and a few black men of broad culture, catholic
\par tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and
\par giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?
\par 
\par Patience, Humility, Manners, and Taste, common schools and
\par kindergartens, industrial and technical schools, literature and
\par tolerance,--all these spring from knowledge and culture, the children
\par of the university.  So must men and nations build, not otherwise, not
\par upside down.
\par 
\par Teach workers to work,--a wise saying; wise when applied to German boys
\par and American girls; wiser when said of Negro boys, for they have less
\par knowledge of working and none to teach them.  Teach thinkers to
\par think,--a needed knowledge in a day of loose and careless logic; and
\par they whose lot is gravest must have the carefulest training to think
\par aright.  If these things are so, how foolish to ask what is the best
\par education for one or seven or sixty million souls! shall we teach them
\par trades, or train them in liberal arts?  Neither and both: teach the
\par workers to work and the thinkers to think; make carpenters of
\par carpenters, and philosophers of philosophers, and fops of fools.  Nor
\par can we pause here.  We are training not isolated men but a living group
\par of men,--nay, a group within a group.  And the final product of our
\par training must be neither a psychologist nor a brickmason, but a man.
\par And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends
\par of living,--not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold.  The worker
\par must work for the glory of his handiwork, not simply for pay; the
\par thinker must think for truth, not for fame.  And all this is gained
\par only by human strife and longing; by ceaseless training and education;
\par by founding Right on righteousness and Truth on the unhampered search
\par for Truth; by founding the common school on the university, and the
\par industrial school on the common school; and weaving thus a system, not
\par a distortion, and bringing a birth, not an abortion.
\par 
\par 
\par When night falls on the City of a Hundred Hills, a wind gathers itself
\par from the seas and comes murmuring westward.  And at its bidding, the
\par smoke of the drowsy factories sweeps down upon the mighty city and
\par covers it like a pall, while yonder at the University the stars twinkle
\par above Stone Hall.  And they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of
\par Atalanta pausing over her golden apples.  Fly, my maiden, fly, for
\par yonder comes Hippomenes!

\par 
\par VI
\par 
\par Of the Training of Black Men
\par 
\par   Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,
\par   And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,
\par     Were't not a Shame--were't not a Shame for him
\par   In this clay carcase crippled to abide?
\par 
\par   OMAR KHAYYAM (FITZGERALD).
\par 
\par 
\par From the shimmering swirl of waters where many, many thoughts ago the
\par slave-ship first saw the square tower of Jamestown, have flowed down to
\par our day three streams of thinking: one swollen from the larger world
\par here and overseas, saying, the multiplying of human wants in
\par culture-lands calls for the world-wide cooperation of men in satisfying
\par them.  Hence arises a new human unity, pulling the ends of earth
\par nearer, and all men, black, yellow, and white.  The larger humanity
\par strives to feel in this contact of living Nations and sleeping hordes a
\par thrill of new life in the world, crying, "If the contact of Life and
\par Sleep be Death, shame on such Life."  To be sure, behind this thought
\par lurks the afterthought of force and dominion,--the making of brown men
\par to delve when the temptation of beads and red calico cloys.
\par 
\par The second thought streaming from the death-ship and the curving river
\par is the thought of the older South,--the sincere and passionate belief
\par that somewhere between men and cattle, God created a tertium quid, and
\par called it a Negro,--a clownish, simple creature, at times even lovable
\par within its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk within the
\par Veil.  To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought,--some of
\par them with favoring chance might become men, but in sheer self-defence
\par we dare not let them, and we build about them walls so high, and hang
\par between them and the light a veil so thick, that they shall not even
\par think of breaking through.
\par 
\par And last of all there trickles down that third and darker thought,--the
\par thought of the things themselves, the confused, half-conscious mutter
\par of men who are black and whitened, crying "Liberty, Freedom,
\par Opportunity--vouchsafe to us, O boastful World, the chance of living
\par men!"  To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought,--suppose,
\par after all, the World is right and we are less than men?  Suppose this
\par mad impulse within is all wrong, some mock mirage from the untrue?
\par 
\par So here we stand among thoughts of human unity, even through conquest
\par and slavery; the inferiority of black men, even if forced by fraud; a
\par shriek in the night for the freedom of men who themselves are not yet
\par sure of their right to demand it.  This is the tangle of thought and
\par afterthought wherein we are called to solve the problem of training men
\par for life.
\par 
\par Behind all its curiousness, so attractive alike to sage and dilettante,
\par lie its dim dangers, throwing across us shadows at once grotesque and
\par awful.  Plain it is to us that what the world seeks through desert and
\par wild we have within our threshold,--a stalwart laboring force, suited
\par to the semi-tropics; if, deaf to the voice of the Zeitgeist, we refuse
\par to use and develop these men, we risk poverty and loss.  If, on the
\par other hand, seized by the brutal afterthought, we debauch the race thus
\par caught in our talons, selfishly sucking their blood and brains in the
\par future as in the past, what shall save us from national decadence?
\par Only that saner selfishness, which Education teaches, can find the
\par rights of all in the whirl of work.
\par 
\par Again, we may decry the color-prejudice of the South, yet it remains a
\par heavy fact.  Such curious kinks of the human mind exist and must be
\par reckoned with soberly.  They cannot be laughed away, nor always
\par successfully stormed at, nor easily abolished by act of legislature.
\par And yet they must not be encouraged by being let alone.  They must be
\par recognized as facts, but unpleasant facts; things that stand in the way
\par of civilization and religion and common decency.  They can be met in
\par but one way,--by the breadth and broadening of human reason, by
\par catholicity of taste and culture.  And so, too, the native ambition and
\par aspiration of men, even though they be black, backward, and ungraceful,
\par must not lightly be dealt with.  To stimulate wildly weak and untrained
\par minds is to play with mighty fires; to flout their striving idly is to
\par welcome a harvest of brutish crime and shameless lethargy in our very
\par laps.  The guiding of thought and the deft coordination of deed is at
\par once the path of honor and humanity.
\par 
\par And so, in this great question of reconciling three vast and partially
\par contradictory streams of thought, the one panacea of Education leaps to
\par the lips of all:--such human training as will best use the labor of all
\par men without enslaving or brutalizing; such training as will give us
\par poise to encourage the prejudices that bulwark society, and to stamp
\par out those that in sheer barbarity deafen us to the wail of prisoned
\par souls within the Veil, and the mounting fury of shackled men.
\par 
\par But when we have vaguely said that Education will set this tangle
\par straight, what have we uttered but a truism?  Training for life teaches
\par living; but what training for the profitable living together of black
\par men and white?  A hundred and fifty years ago our task would have
\par seemed easier.  Then Dr. Johnson blandly assured us that education was
\par needful solely for the embellishments of life, and was useless for
\par ordinary vermin.  To-day we have climbed to heights where we would open
\par at least the outer courts of knowledge to all, display its treasures to
\par many, and select the few to whom its mystery of Truth is revealed, not
\par wholly by birth or the accidents of the stock market, but at least in
\par part according to deftness and aim, talent and character.  This
\par programme, however, we are sorely puzzled in carrying out through that
\par part of the land where the blight of slavery fell hardest, and where we
\par are dealing with two backward peoples.  To make here in human education
\par that ever necessary combination of the permanent and the contingent--of
\par the ideal and the practical in workable equilibrium--has been there, as
\par it ever must be in every age and place, a matter of infinite experiment
\par and frequent mistakes.
\par 
\par In rough approximation we may point out four varying decades of work in
\par Southern education since the Civil War.  From the close of the war
\par until 1876, was the period of uncertain groping and temporary relief.
\par There were army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedmen's
\par Bureau in chaotic disarrangement seeking system and co-operation.  Then
\par followed ten years of constructive definite effort toward the building
\par of complete school systems in the South.  Normal schools and colleges
\par were founded for the freedmen, and teachers trained there to man the
\par public schools.  There was the inevitable tendency of war to
\par underestimate the prejudices of the master and the ignorance of the
\par slave, and all seemed clear sailing out of the wreckage of the storm.
\par Meantime, starting in this decade yet especially developing from 1885
\par to 1895, began the industrial revolution of the South.  The land saw
\par glimpses of a new destiny and the stirring of new ideals.  The
\par educational system striving to complete itself saw new obstacles and a
\par field of work ever broader and deeper.  The Negro colleges, hurriedly
\par founded, were inadequately equipped, illogically distributed, and of
\par varying efficiency and grade; the normal and high schools were doing
\par little more than common-school work, and the common schools were
\par training but a third of the children who ought to be in them, and
\par training these too often poorly.  At the same time the white South, by
\par reason of its sudden conversion from the slavery ideal, by so much the
\par more became set and strengthened in its racial prejudice, and
\par crystallized it into harsh law and harsher custom; while the marvellous
\par pushing forward of the poor white daily threatened to take even bread
\par and butter from the mouths of the heavily handicapped sons of the
\par freedmen.  In the midst, then, of the larger problem of Negro education
\par sprang up the more practical question of work, the inevitable economic
\par quandary that faces a people in the transition from slavery to freedom,
\par and especially those who make that change amid hate and prejudice,
\par lawlessness and ruthless competition.
\par 
\par The industrial school springing to notice in this decade, but coming to
\par full recognition in the decade beginning with 1895, was the proffered
\par answer to this combined educational and economic crisis, and an answer
\par of singular wisdom and timeliness.  From the very first in nearly all
\par the schools some attention had been given to training in handiwork, but
\par now was this training first raised to a dignity that brought it in
\par direct touch with the South's magnificent industrial development, and
\par given an emphasis which reminded black folk that before the Temple of
\par Knowledge swing the Gates of Toil.
\par 
\par Yet after all they are but gates, and when turning our eyes from the
\par temporary and the contingent in the Negro problem to the broader
\par question of the permanent uplifting and civilization of black men in
\par America, we have a right to inquire, as this enthusiasm for material
\par advancement mounts to its height, if after all the industrial school is
\par the final and sufficient answer in the training of the Negro race; and
\par to ask gently, but in all sincerity, the ever-recurring query of the
\par ages, Is not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?  And
\par men ask this to-day all the more eagerly because of sinister signs in
\par recent educational movements.  The tendency is here, born of slavery
\par and quickened to renewed life by the crazy imperialism of the day, to
\par regard human beings as among the material resources of a land to be
\par trained with an eye single to future dividends.  Race-prejudices, which
\par keep brown and black men in their "places," we are coming to regard as
\par useful allies with such a theory, no matter how much they may dull the
\par ambition and sicken the hearts of struggling human beings.  And above
\par all, we daily hear that an education that encourages aspiration, that
\par sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character
\par rather than bread-winning, is the privilege of white men and the danger
\par and delusion of black.
\par 
\par Especially has criticism been directed against the former educational
\par efforts to aid the Negro.  In the four periods I have mentioned, we
\par find first, boundless, planless enthusiasm and sacrifice; then the
\par preparation of teachers for a vast public-school system; then the
\par launching and expansion of that school system amid increasing
\par difficulties; and finally the training of workmen for the new and
\par growing industries.  This development has been sharply ridiculed as a
\par logical anomaly and flat reversal of nature.  Soothly we have been told
\par that first industrial and manual training should have taught the Negro
\par to work, then simple schools should have taught him to read and write,
\par and finally, after years, high and normal schools could have completed
\par the system, as intelligence and wealth demanded.
\par 
\par That a system logically so complete was historically impossible, it
\par needs but a little thought to prove.  Progress in human affairs is more
\par often a pull than a push, a surging forward of the exceptional man, and
\par the lifting of his duller brethren slowly and painfully to his
\par vantage-ground.  Thus it was no accident that gave birth to
\par universities centuries before the common schools, that made fair
\par Harvard the first flower of our wilderness.  So in the South: the mass
\par of the freedmen at the end of the war lacked the intelligence so
\par necessary to modern workingmen.  They must first have the common school
\par to teach them to read, write, and cipher; and they must have higher
\par schools to teach teachers for the common schools.  The white teachers
\par who flocked South went to establish such a common-school system.  Few
\par held the idea of founding colleges; most of them at first would have
\par laughed at the idea.  But they faced, as all men since them have faced,
\par that central paradox of the South,--the social separation of the races.
\par At that time it was the sudden volcanic rupture of nearly all relations
\par between black and white, in work and government and family life.  Since
\par then a new adjustment of relations in economic and political affairs
\par has grown up,--an adjustment subtle and difficult to grasp, yet
\par singularly ingenious, which leaves still that frightful chasm at the
\par color-line across which men pass at their peril.  Thus, then and now,
\par there stand in the South two separate worlds; and separate not simply
\par in the higher realms of social intercourse, but also in church and
\par school, on railway and street-car, in hotels and theatres, in streets
\par and city sections, in books and newspapers, in asylums and jails, in
\par hospitals and graveyards.  There is still enough of contact for large
\par economic and group cooperation, but the separation is so thorough and
\par deep that it absolutely precludes for the present between the races
\par anything like that sympathetic and effective group-training and
\par leadership of the one by the other, such as the American Negro and all
\par backward peoples must have for effectual progress.
\par 
\par This the missionaries of '68 soon saw; and if effective industrial and
\par trade schools were impracticable before the establishment of a
\par common-school system, just as certainly no adequate common schools
\par could be founded until there were teachers to teach them.  Southern
\par whites would not teach them; Northern whites in sufficient numbers
\par could not be had.  If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself,
\par and the most effective help that could be given him was the
\par establishment of schools to train Negro teachers.  This conclusion was
\par slowly but surely reached by every student of the situation until
\par simultaneously, in widely separated regions, without consultation or
\par systematic plan, there arose a series of institutions designed to
\par furnish teachers for the untaught.  Above the sneers of critics at the
\par obvious defects of this procedure must ever stand its one crushing
\par rejoinder: in a single generation they put thirty thousand black
\par teachers in the South; they wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of
\par the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee possible.
\par 
\par Such higher training-schools tended naturally to deepen broader
\par development: at first they were common and grammar schools, then some
\par became high schools.  And finally, by 1900, some thirty-four had one
\par year or more of studies of college grade.  This development was reached
\par with different degrees of speed in different institutions: Hampton is
\par still a high school, while Fisk University started her college in 1871,
\par and Spelman Seminary about 1896.  In all cases the aim was
\par identical,--to maintain the standards of the lower training by giving
\par teachers and leaders the best practicable training; and above all, to
\par furnish the black world with adequate standards of human culture and
\par lofty ideals of life.  It was not enough that the teachers of teachers
\par should be trained in technical normal methods; they must also, so far
\par as possible, be broad-minded, cultured men and women, to scatter
\par civilization among a people whose ignorance was not simply of letters,
\par but of life itself.
\par 
\par It can thus be seen that the work of education in the South began with
\par higher institutions of training, which threw off as their foliage
\par common schools, and later industrial schools, and at the same time
\par strove to shoot their roots ever deeper toward college and university
\par training.  That this was an inevitable and necessary development,
\par sooner or later, goes without saying; but there has been, and still is,
\par a question in many minds if the natural growth was not forced, and if
\par the higher training was not either overdone or done with cheap and
\par unsound methods.  Among white Southerners this feeling is widespread
\par and positive.  A prominent Southern journal voiced this in a recent
\par editorial.
\par 
\par "The experiment that has been made to give the colored students
\par classical training has not been satisfactory.  Even though many were
\par able to pursue the course, most of them did so in a parrot-like way,
\par learning what was taught, but not seeming to appropriate the truth and
\par import of their instruction, and graduating without sensible aim or
\par valuable occupation for their future.  The whole scheme has proved a
\par waste of time, efforts, and the money of the state."
\par 
\par While most fair-minded men would recognize this as extreme and
\par overdrawn, still without doubt many are asking, Are there a sufficient
\par number of Negroes ready for college training to warrant the
\par undertaking?  Are not too many students prematurely forced into this
\par work?  Does it not have the effect of dissatisfying the young Negro
\par with his environment?  And do these graduates succeed in real life?
\par Such natural questions cannot be evaded, nor on the other hand must a
\par Nation naturally skeptical as to Negro ability assume an unfavorable
\par answer without careful inquiry and patient openness to conviction.  We
\par must not forget that most Americans answer all queries regarding the
\par Negro a priori, and that the least that human courtesy can do is to
\par listen to evidence.
\par 
\par The advocates of the higher education of the Negro would be the last to
\par deny the incompleteness and glaring defects of the present system: too
\par many institutions have attempted to do college work, the work in some
\par cases has not been thoroughly done, and quantity rather than quality
\par has sometimes been sought.  But all this can be said of higher
\par education throughout the land; it is the almost inevitable incident of
\par educational growth, and leaves the deeper question of the legitimate
\par demand for the higher training of Negroes untouched.  And this latter
\par question can be settled in but one way,--by a first-hand study of the
\par facts.  If we leave out of view all institutions which have not
\par actually graduated students from a course higher than that of a New
\par England high school, even though they be called colleges; if then we
\par take the thirty-four remaining institutions, we may clear up many
\par misapprehensions by asking searchingly, What kind of institutions are
\par they? what do they teach? and what sort of men do they graduate?
\par 
\par And first we may say that this type of college, including Atlanta,
\par Fisk, and Howard, Wilberforce and Claflin, Shaw, and the rest, is
\par peculiar, almost unique.  Through the shining trees that whisper before
\par me as I write, I catch glimpses of a boulder of New England granite,
\par covering a grave, which graduates of Atlanta University have placed
\par there,--
\par 
\par 
\par    "GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THEIR FORMER TEACHER
\par    AND FRIEND AND OF THE UNSELFISH LIFE HE LIVED,
\par    AND THE NOBLE WORK HE WROUGHT; THAT THEY,
\par    THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN
\par               MIGHT BE BLESSED."
\par 
\par 
\par This was the gift of New England to the freed Negro: not alms, but a
\par friend; not cash, but character.  It was not and is not money these
\par seething millions want, but love and sympathy, the pulse of hearts
\par beating with red blood;--a gift which to-day only their own kindred and
\par race can bring to the masses, but which once saintly souls brought to
\par their favored children in the crusade of the sixties, that finest thing
\par in American history, and one of the few things untainted by sordid
\par greed and cheap vainglory.  The teachers in these institutions came not
\par to keep the Negroes in their place, but to raise them out of the
\par defilement of the places where slavery had wallowed them.  The colleges
\par they founded were social settlements; homes where the best of the sons
\par of the freedmen came in close and sympathetic touch with the best
\par traditions of New England.  They lived and ate together, studied and
\par worked, hoped and harkened in the dawning light.  In actual formal
\par content their curriculum was doubtless old-fashioned, but in
\par educational power it was supreme, for it was the contact of living
\par souls.
\par 
\par From such schools about two thousand Negroes have gone forth with the
\par bachelor's degree.  The number in itself is enough to put at rest the
\par argument that too large a proportion of Negroes are receiving higher
\par training.  If the ratio to population of all Negro students throughout
\par the land, in both college and secondary training, be counted,
\par Commissioner Harris assures us "it must be increased to five times its
\par present average" to equal the average of the land.
\par 
\par Fifty years ago the ability of Negro students in any appreciable
\par numbers to master a modern college course would have been difficult to
\par prove.  To-day it is proved by the fact that four hundred Negroes, many
\par of whom have been reported as brilliant students, have received the
\par bachelor's degree from Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, and seventy other
\par leading colleges.  Here we have, then, nearly twenty-five hundred Negro
\par graduates, of whom the crucial query must be made, How far did their
\par training fit them for life?  It is of course extremely difficult to
\par collect satisfactory data on such a point,--difficult to reach the men,
\par to get trustworthy testimony, and to gauge that testimony by any
\par generally acceptable criterion of success.  In 1900, the Conference at
\par Atlanta University undertook to study these graduates, and published
\par the results.  First they sought to know what these graduates were
\par doing, and succeeded in getting answers from nearly two-thirds of the
\par living.  The direct testimony was in almost all cases corroborated by
\par the reports of the colleges where they graduated, so that in the main
\par the reports were worthy of credence.  Fifty-three per cent of these
\par graduates were teachers,--presidents of institutions, heads of normal
\par schools, principals of city school-systems, and the like.  Seventeen
\par per cent were clergymen; another seventeen per cent were in the
\par professions, chiefly as physicians.  Over six per cent were merchants,
\par farmers, and artisans, and four per cent were in the government
\par civil-service.  Granting even that a considerable proportion of the
\par third unheard from are unsuccessful, this is a record of usefulness.
\par Personally I know many hundreds of these graduates, and have
\par corresponded with more than a thousand; through others I have followed
\par carefully the life-work of scores; I have taught some of them and some
\par of the pupils whom they have taught, lived in homes which they have
\par builded, and looked at life through their eyes.  Comparing them as a
\par class with my fellow students in New England and in Europe, I cannot
\par hesitate in saying that nowhere have I met men and women with a broader
\par spirit of helpfulness, with deeper devotion to their life-work, or with
\par more consecrated determination to succeed in the face of bitter
\par difficulties than among Negro college-bred men.  They have, to be sure,
\par their proportion of ne'er-do-wells, their pedants and lettered fools,
\par but they have a surprisingly small proportion of them; they have not
\par that culture of manner which we instinctively associate with university
\par men, forgetting that in reality it is the heritage from cultured homes,
\par and that no people a generation removed from slavery can escape a
\par certain unpleasant rawness and gaucherie, despite the best of training.
\par 
\par With all their larger vision and deeper sensibility, these men have
\par usually been conservative, careful leaders.  They have seldom been
\par agitators, have withstood the temptation to head the mob, and have
\par worked steadily and faithfully in a thousand communities in the South.
\par As teachers, they have given the South a commendable system of city
\par schools and large numbers of private normal-schools and academies.
\par Colored college-bred men have worked side by side with white college
\par graduates at Hampton; almost from the beginning the backbone of
\par Tuskegee's teaching force has been formed of graduates from Fisk and
\par Atlanta.  And to-day the institute is filled with college graduates,
\par from the energetic wife of the principal down to the teacher of
\par agriculture, including nearly half of the executive council and a
\par majority of the heads of departments.  In the professions, college men
\par are slowly but surely leavening the Negro church, are healing and
\par preventing the devastations of disease, and beginning to furnish legal
\par protection for the liberty and property of the toiling masses.  All
\par this is needful work.  Who would do it if Negroes did not?  How could
\par Negroes do it if they were not trained carefully for it?  If white
\par people need colleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and
\par doctors, do black people need nothing of the sort?
\par 
\par If it is true that there are an appreciable number of Negro youth in
\par the land capable by character and talent to receive that higher
\par training, the end of which is culture, and if the two and a half
\par thousand who have had something of this training in the past have in
\par the main proved themselves useful to their race and generation, the
\par question then comes, What place in the future development of the South
\par ought the Negro college and college-bred man to occupy?  That the
\par present social separation and acute race-sensitiveness must eventually
\par yield to the influences of culture, as the South grows civilized, is
\par clear.  But such transformation calls for singular wisdom and patience.
\par If, while the healing of this vast sore is progressing, the races are
\par to live for many years side by side, united in economic effort, obeying
\par a common government, sensitive to mutual thought and feeling, yet
\par subtly and silently separate in many matters of deeper human
\par intimacy,--if this unusual and dangerous development is to progress
\par amid peace and order, mutual respect and growing intelligence, it will
\par call for social surgery at once the delicatest and nicest in modern
\par history.  It will demand broad-minded, upright men, both white and
\par black, and in its final accomplishment American civilization will
\par triumph.  So far as white men are concerned, this fact is to-day being
\par recognized in the South, and a happy renaissance of university
\par education seems imminent.  But the very voices that cry hail to this
\par good work are, strange to relate, largely silent or antagonistic to the
\par higher education of the Negro.
\par 
\par Strange to relate! for this is certain, no secure civilization can be
\par built in the South with the Negro as an ignorant, turbulent
\par proletariat.  Suppose we seek to remedy this by making them laborers
\par and nothing more: they are not fools, they have tasted of the Tree of
\par Life, and they will not cease to think, will not cease attempting to
\par read the riddle of the world.  By taking away their best equipped
\par teachers and leaders, by slamming the door of opportunity in the faces
\par of their bolder and brighter minds, will you make them satisfied with
\par their lot? or will you not rather transfer their leading from the hands
\par of men taught to think to the hands of untrained demagogues?  We ought
\par not to forget that despite the pressure of poverty, and despite the
\par active discouragement and even ridicule of friends, the demand for
\par higher training steadily increases among Negro youth: there were, in
\par the years from 1875 to 1880, 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges;
\par from 1885 to 1890 there were 43, and from 1895 to 1900, nearly 100
\par graduates.  From Southern Negro colleges there were, in the same three
\par periods, 143, 413, and over 500 graduates.  Here, then, is the plain
\par thirst for training; by refusing to give this Talented Tenth the key to
\par knowledge, can any sane man imagine that they will lightly lay aside
\par their yearning and contentedly become hewers of wood and drawers of
\par water?
\par 
\par No. The dangerously clear logic of the Negro's position will more and
\par more loudly assert itself in that day when increasing wealth and more
\par intricate social organization preclude the South from being, as it so
\par largely is, simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk.  Such
\par waste of energy cannot be spared if the South is to catch up with
\par civilization.  And as the black third of the land grows in thrift and
\par skill, unless skilfully guided in its larger philosophy, it must more
\par and more brood over the red past and the creeping, crooked present,
\par until it grasps a gospel of revolt and revenge and throws its new-found
\par energies athwart the current of advance.  Even to-day the masses of the
\par Negroes see all too clearly the anomalies of their position and the
\par moral crookedness of yours.  You may marshal strong indictments against
\par them, but their counter-cries, lacking though they be in formal logic,
\par have burning truths within them which you may not wholly ignore, O
\par Southern Gentlemen!  If you deplore their presence here, they ask, Who
\par brought us?  When you cry, Deliver us from the vision of intermarriage,
\par they answer that legal marriage is infinitely better than systematic
\par concubinage and prostitution.  And if in just fury you accuse their
\par vagabonds of violating women, they also in fury quite as just may
\par reply: The rape which your gentlemen have done against helpless black
\par women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two
\par millions of mulattoes, and written in ineffaceable blood.  And finally,
\par when you fasten crime upon this race as its peculiar trait, they answer
\par that slavery was the arch-crime, and lynching and lawlessness its twin
\par abortions; that color and race are not crimes, and yet it is they which
\par in this land receive most unceasing condemnation, North, East, South,
\par and West.
\par 
\par I will not say such arguments are wholly justified,--I will not insist
\par that there is no other side to the shield; but I do say that of the
\par nine millions of Negroes in this nation, there is scarcely one out of
\par the cradle to whom these arguments do not daily present themselves in
\par the guise of terrible truth.  I insist that the question of the future
\par is how best to keep these millions from brooding over the wrongs of the
\par past and the difficulties of the present, so that all their energies
\par may be bent toward a cheerful striving and cooperation with their white
\par neighbors toward a larger, juster, and fuller future.  That one wise
\par method of doing this lies in the closer knitting of the Negro to the
\par great industrial possibilities of the South is a great truth.  And this
\par the common schools and the manual training and trade schools are
\par working to accomplish.  But these alone are not enough.  The
\par foundations of knowledge in this race, as in others, must be sunk deep
\par in the college and university if we would build a solid, permanent
\par structure.  Internal problems of social advance must inevitably come,
\par --problems of work and wages, of families and homes, of morals and the
\par true valuing of the things of life; and all these and other inevitable
\par problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for
\par himself, by reason of his isolation; and can there be any possible
\par solution other than by study and thought and an appeal to the rich
\par experience of the past?  Is there not, with such a group and in such a
\par crisis, infinitely more danger to be apprehended from half-trained
\par minds and shallow thinking than from over-education and
\par over-refinement?  Surely we have wit enough to found a Negro college so
\par manned and equipped as to steer successfully between the dilettante and
\par the fool.  We shall hardly induce black men to believe that if their
\par stomachs be full, it matters little about their brains.  They already
\par dimly perceive that the paths of peace winding between honest toil and
\par dignified manhood call for the guidance of skilled thinkers, the
\par loving, reverent comradeship between the black lowly and the black men
\par emancipated by training and culture.
\par 
\par The function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the
\par standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of
\par the Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact
\par and cooperation.  And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.
\par Above our modern socialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must
\par persist and evolve that higher individualism which the centres of
\par culture protect; there must come a loftier respect for the sovereign
\par human soul that seeks to know itself and the world about it; that seeks
\par a freedom for expansion and self-development; that will love and hate
\par and labor in its own way, untrammeled alike by old and new.  Such souls
\par aforetime have inspired and guided worlds, and if we be not wholly
\par bewitched by our Rhinegold, they shall again.  Herein the longing of
\par black men must have respect: the rich and bitter depth of their
\par experience, the unknown treasures of their inner life, the strange
\par rendings of nature they have seen, may give the world new points of
\par view and make their loving, living, and doing precious to all human
\par hearts.  And to themselves in these the days that try their souls, the
\par chance to soar in the dim blue air above the smoke is to their finer
\par spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black.
\par 
\par I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not.  Across the color line I move
\par arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women
\par glide in gilded halls.  From out the caves of evening that swing
\par between the strong-limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I summon
\par Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all
\par graciously with no scorn nor condescension.  So, wed with Truth, I
\par dwell above the Veil.  Is this the life you grudge us, O knightly
\par America?  Is this the life you long to change into the dull red
\par hideousness of Georgia?  Are you so afraid lest peering from this high
\par Pisgah, between Philistine and Amalekite, we sight the Promised Land?
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par VII
\par 
\par Of the Black Belt
\par 
\par   I am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
\par   As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
\par   Look not upon me, because I am black,
\par   Because the sun hath looked upon me:
\par   My mother's children were angry with me;
\par   They made me the keeper of the vineyards;
\par   But mine own vineyard have I not kept.
\par 
\par   THE SONG OF SOLOMON.
\par 
\par 
\par Out of the North the train thundered, and we woke to see the crimson
\par soil of Georgia stretching away bare and monotonous right and left.
\par Here and there lay straggling, unlovely villages, and lean men loafed
\par leisurely at the depots; then again came the stretch of pines and clay.
\par Yet we did not nod, nor weary of the scene; for this is historic
\par ground.  Right across our track, three hundred and sixty years ago,
\par wandered the cavalcade of Hernando de Soto, looking for gold and the
\par Great Sea; and he and his foot-sore captives disappeared yonder in the
\par grim forests to the west.  Here sits Atlanta, the city of a hundred
\par hills, with something Western, something Southern, and something quite
\par its own, in its busy life.  Just this side Atlanta is the land of the
\par Cherokees and to the southwest, not far from where Sam Hose was
\par crucified, you may stand on a spot which is to-day the centre of the
\par Negro problem,--the centre of those nine million men who are America's
\par dark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade.
\par 
\par Not only is Georgia thus the geographical focus of our Negro
\par population, but in many other respects, both now and yesterday, the
\par Negro problems have seemed to be centered in this State.  No other
\par State in the Union can count a million Negroes among its citizens,--a
\par population as large as the slave population of the whole Union in 1800;
\par no other State fought so long and strenuously to gather this host of
\par Africans.  Oglethorpe thought slavery against law and gospel; but the
\par circumstances which gave Georgia its first inhabitants were not
\par calculated to furnish citizens over-nice in their ideas about rum and
\par slaves.  Despite the prohibitions of the trustees, these Georgians,
\par like some of their descendants, proceeded to take the law into their
\par own hands; and so pliant were the judges, and so flagrant the
\par smuggling, and so earnest were the prayers of Whitefield, that by the
\par middle of the eighteenth century all restrictions were swept away, and
\par the slave-trade went merrily on for fifty years and more.
\par 
\par Down in Darien, where the Delegal riots took place some summers ago,
\par there used to come a strong protest against slavery from the Scotch
\par Highlanders; and the Moravians of Ebenezer did not like the system.
\par But not till the Haytian Terror of Toussaint was the trade in men even
\par checked; while the national statute of 1808 did not suffice to stop it.
\par How the Africans poured in!--fifty thousand between 1790 and 1810, and
\par then, from Virginia and from smugglers, two thousand a year for many
\par years more.  So the thirty thousand Negroes of Georgia in 1790 doubled
\par in a decade,--were over a hundred thousand in 1810, had reached two
\par hundred thousand in 1820, and half a million at the time of the war.
\par Thus like a snake the black population writhed upward.
\par 
\par But we must hasten on our journey.  This that we pass as we near
\par Atlanta is the ancient land of the Cherokees,--that brave Indian nation
\par which strove so long for its fatherland, until Fate and the United
\par States Government drove them beyond the Mississippi.  If you wish to
\par ride with me you must come into the "Jim Crow Car."  There will be no
\par objection,--already four other white men, and a little white girl with
\par her nurse, are in there.  Usually the races are mixed in there; but the
\par white coach is all white.  Of course this car is not so good as the
\par other, but it is fairly clean and comfortable.  The discomfort lies
\par chiefly in the hearts of those four black men yonder--and in mine.
\par 
\par We rumble south in quite a business-like way.  The bare red clay and
\par pines of Northern Georgia begin to disappear, and in their place
\par appears a rich rolling land, luxuriant, and here and there well tilled.
\par This is the land of the Creek Indians; and a hard time the Georgians
\par had to seize it.  The towns grow more frequent and more interesting,
\par and brand-new cotton mills rise on every side.  Below Macon the world
\par grows darker; for now we approach the Black Belt,--that strange land of
\par shadows, at which even slaves paled in the past, and whence come now
\par only faint and half-intelligible murmurs to the world beyond.  The "Jim
\par Crow Car" grows larger and a shade better; three rough field-hands and
\par two or three white loafers accompany us, and the newsboy still spreads
\par his wares at one end.  The sun is setting, but we can see the great
\par cotton country as we enter it,--the soil now dark and fertile, now thin
\par and gray, with fruit-trees and dilapidated buildings,--all the way to
\par Albany.
\par 
\par At Albany, in the heart of the Black Belt, we stop.  Two hundred miles
\par south of Atlanta, two hundred miles west of the Atlantic, and one
\par hundred miles north of the Great Gulf lies Dougherty County, with ten
\par thousand Negroes and two thousand whites.  The Flint River winds down
\par from Andersonville, and, turning suddenly at Albany, the county-seat,
\par hurries on to join the Chattahoochee and the sea.  Andrew Jackson knew
\par the Flint well, and marched across it once to avenge the Indian
\par Massacre at Fort Mims.  That was in 1814, not long before the battle of
\par New Orleans; and by the Creek treaty that followed this campaign, all
\par Dougherty County, and much other rich land, was ceded to Georgia.
\par Still, settlers fought shy of this land, for the Indians were all
\par about, and they were unpleasant neighbors in those days.  The panic of
\par 1837, which Jackson bequeathed to Van Buren, turned the planters from
\par the impoverished lands of Virginia, the Carolinas, and east Georgia,
\par toward the West.  The Indians were removed to Indian Territory, and
\par settlers poured into these coveted lands to retrieve their broken
\par fortunes.  For a radius of a hundred miles about Albany, stretched a
\par great fertile land, luxuriant with forests of pine, oak, ash, hickory,
\par and poplar; hot with the sun and damp with the rich black swamp-land;
\par and here the corner-stone of the Cotton Kingdom was laid.
\par 
\par Albany is to-day a wide-streeted, placid, Southern town, with a broad
\par sweep of stores and saloons, and flanking rows of homes,--whites
\par usually to the north, and blacks to the south.  Six days in the week
\par the town looks decidedly too small for itself, and takes frequent and
\par prolonged naps.  But on Saturday suddenly the whole county disgorges
\par itself upon the place, and a perfect flood of black peasantry pours
\par through the streets, fills the stores, blocks the sidewalks, chokes the
\par thoroughfares, and takes full possession of the town.  They are black,
\par sturdy, uncouth country folk, good-natured and simple, talkative to a
\par degree, and yet far more silent and brooding than the crowds of the
\par Rhine-pfalz, or Naples, or Cracow.  They drink considerable quantities
\par of whiskey, but do not get very drunk; they talk and laugh loudly at
\par times, but seldom quarrel or fight.  They walk up and down the streets,
\par meet and gossip with friends, stare at the shop windows, buy coffee,
\par cheap candy, and clothes, and at dusk drive home--happy? well no, not
\par exactly happy, but much happier than as though they had not come.
\par 
\par Thus Albany is a real capital,--a typical Southern county town, the
\par centre of the life of ten thousand souls; their point of contact with
\par the outer world, their centre of news and gossip, their market for
\par buying and selling, borrowing and lending, their fountain of justice
\par and law.  Once upon a time we knew country life so well and city life
\par so little, that we illustrated city life as that of a closely crowded
\par country district.  Now the world has well-nigh forgotten what the
\par country is, and we must imagine a little city of black people scattered
\par far and wide over three hundred lonesome square miles of land, without
\par train or trolley, in the midst of cotton and corn, and wide patches of
\par sand and gloomy soil.
\par 
\par It gets pretty hot in Southern Georgia in July,--a sort of dull,
\par determined heat that seems quite independent of the sun; so it took us
\par some days to muster courage enough to leave the porch and venture out
\par on the long country roads, that we might see this unknown world.
\par Finally we started.  It was about ten in the morning, bright with a
\par faint breeze, and we jogged leisurely southward in the valley of the
\par Flint.  We passed the scattered box-like cabins of the brickyard hands,
\par and the long tenement-row facetiously called "The Ark," and were soon
\par in the open country, and on the confines of the great plantations of
\par other days.  There is the "Joe Fields place"; a rough old fellow was
\par he, and had killed many a "nigger" in his day.  Twelve miles his
\par plantation used to run,--a regular barony.  It is nearly all gone now;
\par only straggling bits belong to the family, and the rest has passed to
\par Jews and Negroes.  Even the bits which are left are heavily mortgaged,
\par and, like the rest of the land, tilled by tenants.  Here is one of them
\par now,--a tall brown man, a hard worker and a hard drinker, illiterate,
\par but versed in farmlore, as his nodding crops declare.  This
\par distressingly new board house is his, and he has just moved out of
\par yonder moss-grown cabin with its one square room.
\par 
\par From the curtains in Benton's house, down the road, a dark comely face
\par is staring at the strangers; for passing carriages are not every-day
\par occurrences here.  Benton is an intelligent yellow man with a
\par good-sized family, and manages a plantation blasted by the war and now
\par the broken staff of the widow.  He might be well-to-do, they say; but
\par he carouses too much in Albany.  And the half-desolate spirit of
\par neglect born of the very soil seems to have settled on these acres.  In
\par times past there were cotton-gins and machinery here; but they have
\par rotted away.
\par 
\par The whole land seems forlorn and forsaken.  Here are the remnants of
\par the vast plantations of the Sheldons, the Pellots, and the Rensons; but
\par the souls of them are passed.  The houses lie in half ruin, or have
\par wholly disappeared; the fences have flown, and the families are
\par wandering in the world.  Strange vicissitudes have met these whilom
\par masters.  Yonder stretch the wide acres of Bildad Reasor; he died in
\par war-time, but the upstart overseer hastened to wed the widow.  Then he
\par went, and his neighbors too, and now only the black tenant remains; but
\par the shadow-hand of the master's grand-nephew or cousin or creditor
\par stretches out of the gray distance to collect the rack-rent
\par remorselessly, and so the land is uncared-for and poor.  Only black
\par tenants can stand such a system, and they only because they must.  Ten
\par miles we have ridden to-day and have seen no white face.
\par 
\par A resistless feeling of depression falls slowly upon us, despite the
\par gaudy sunshine and the green cottonfields.  This, then, is the Cotton
\par Kingdom,--the shadow of a marvellous dream.  And where is the King?
\par Perhaps this is he,--the sweating ploughman, tilling his eighty acres
\par with two lean mules, and fighting a hard battle with debt.  So we sit
\par musing, until, as we turn a corner on the sandy road, there comes a
\par fairer scene suddenly in view,--a neat cottage snugly ensconced by the
\par road, and near it a little store.  A tall bronzed man rises from the
\par porch as we hail him, and comes out to our carriage.  He is six feet in
\par height, with a sober face that smiles gravely.  He walks too straight
\par to be a tenant,--yes, he owns two hundred and forty acres.  "The land
\par is run down since the boom-days of eighteen hundred and fifty," he
\par explains, and cotton is low.  Three black tenants live on his place,
\par and in his little store he keeps a small stock of tobacco, snuff, soap,
\par and soda, for the neighborhood.  Here is his gin-house with new
\par machinery just installed.  Three hundred bales of cotton went through
\par it last year.  Two children he has sent away to school.  Yes, he says
\par sadly, he is getting on, but cotton is down to four cents; I know how
\par Debt sits staring at him.
\par 
\par Wherever the King may be, the parks and palaces of the Cotton Kingdom
\par have not wholly disappeared.  We plunge even now into great groves of
\par oak and towering pine, with an undergrowth of myrtle and shrubbery.
\par This was the "home-house" of the Thompsons,--slave-barons who drove
\par their coach and four in the merry past.  All is silence now, and ashes,
\par and tangled weeds.  The owner put his whole fortune into the rising
\par cotton industry of the fifties, and with the falling prices of the
\par eighties he packed up and stole away.  Yonder is another grove, with
\par unkempt lawn, great magnolias, and grass-grown paths.  The Big House
\par stands in half-ruin, its great front door staring blankly at the
\par street, and the back part grotesquely restored for its black tenant.  A
\par shabby, well-built Negro he is, unlucky and irresolute.  He digs hard
\par to pay rent to the white girl who owns the remnant of the place.  She
\par married a policeman, and lives in Savannah.
\par 
\par Now and again we come to churches.  Here is one now,--Shepherd's, they
\par call it,--a great whitewashed barn of a thing, perched on stilts of
\par stone, and looking for all the world as though it were just resting
\par here a moment and might be expected to waddle off down the road at
\par almost any time.  And yet it is the centre of a hundred cabin homes;
\par and sometimes, of a Sunday, five hundred persons from far and near
\par gather here and talk and eat and sing.  There is a schoolhouse near,--a
\par very airy, empty shed; but even this is an improvement, for usually the
\par school is held in the church.  The churches vary from log-huts to those
\par like Shepherd's, and the schools from nothing to this little house that
\par sits demurely on the county line.  It is a tiny plank-house, perhaps
\par ten by twenty, and has within a double row of rough unplaned benches,
\par resting mostly on legs, sometimes on boxes.  Opposite the door is a
\par square home-made desk.  In one corner are the ruins of a stove, and in
\par the other a dim blackboard.  It is the cheerfulest schoolhouse I have
\par seen in Dougherty, save in town.  Back of the schoolhouse is a
\par lodgehouse two stories high and not quite finished.  Societies meet
\par there,--societies "to care for the sick and bury the dead"; and these
\par societies grow and flourish.
\par 
\par We had come to the boundaries of Dougherty, and were about to turn west
\par along the county-line, when all these sights were pointed out to us by
\par a kindly old man, black, white-haired, and seventy.  Forty-five years
\par he had lived here, and now supports himself and his old wife by the
\par help of the steer tethered yonder and the charity of his black
\par neighbors.  He shows us the farm of the Hills just across the county
\par line in Baker,--a widow and two strapping sons, who raised ten bales
\par (one need not add "cotton" down here) last year.  There are fences and
\par pigs and cows, and the soft-voiced, velvet-skinned young Memnon, who
\par sauntered half-bashfully over to greet the strangers, is proud of his
\par home.  We turn now to the west along the county line.  Great dismantled
\par trunks of pines tower above the green cottonfields, cracking their
\par naked gnarled fingers toward the border of living forest beyond.  There
\par is little beauty in this region, only a sort of crude abandon that
\par suggests power,--a naked grandeur, as it were.  The houses are bare and
\par straight; there are no hammocks or easy-chairs, and few flowers.  So
\par when, as here at Rawdon's, one sees a vine clinging to a little porch,
\par and home-like windows peeping over the fences, one takes a long breath.
\par I think I never before quite realized the place of the Fence in
\par civilization.  This is the Land of the Unfenced, where crouch on either
\par hand scores of ugly one-room cabins, cheerless and dirty.  Here lies
\par the Negro problem in its naked dirt and penury.  And here are no
\par fences.  But now and then the crisscross rails or straight palings
\par break into view, and then we know a touch of culture is near.  Of
\par course Harrison Gohagen,--a quiet yellow man, young, smooth-faced, and
\par diligent,--of course he is lord of some hundred acres, and we expect to
\par see a vision of well-kept rooms and fat beds and laughing children.
\par For has he not fine fences?  And those over yonder, why should they
\par build fences on the rack-rented land?  It will only increase their rent.
\par 
\par On we wind, through sand and pines and glimpses of old plantations,
\par till there creeps into sight a cluster of buildings,--wood and brick,
\par mills and houses, and scattered cabins.  It seemed quite a village.  As
\par it came nearer and nearer, however, the aspect changed: the buildings
\par were rotten, the bricks were falling out, the mills were silent, and
\par the store was closed.  Only in the cabins appeared now and then a bit
\par of lazy life.  I could imagine the place under some weird spell, and
\par was half-minded to search out the princess.  An old ragged black man,
\par honest, simple, and improvident, told us the tale.  The Wizard of the
\par North--the Capitalist--had rushed down in the seventies to woo this coy
\par dark soil.  He bought a square mile or more, and for a time the
\par field-hands sang, the gins groaned, and the mills buzzed.  Then came a
\par change.  The agent's son embezzled the funds and ran off with them.
\par Then the agent himself disappeared.  Finally the new agent stole even
\par the books, and the company in wrath closed its business and its houses,
\par refused to sell, and let houses and furniture and machinery rust and
\par rot.  So the Waters-Loring plantation was stilled by the spell of
\par dishonesty, and stands like some gaunt rebuke to a scarred land.
\par 
\par Somehow that plantation ended our day's journey; for I could not shake
\par off the influence of that silent scene.  Back toward town we glided,
\par past the straight and thread-like pines, past a dark tree-dotted pond
\par where the air was heavy with a dead sweet perfume.  White
\par slender-legged curlews flitted by us, and the garnet blooms of the
\par cotton looked gay against the green and purple stalks.  A peasant girl
\par was hoeing in the field, white-turbaned and black-limbed.  All this we
\par saw, but the spell still lay upon us.
\par 
\par How curious a land is this,--how full of untold story, of tragedy and
\par laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic
\par past, and big with future promise!  This is the Black Belt of Georgia.
\par Dougherty County is the west end of the Black Belt, and men once called
\par it the Egypt of the Confederacy.  It is full of historic interest.
\par First there is the Swamp, to the west, where the Chickasawhatchee flows
\par sullenly southward.  The shadow of an old plantation lies at its edge,
\par forlorn and dark.  Then comes the pool; pendent gray moss and brackish
\par waters appear, and forests filled with wildfowl.  In one place the wood
\par is on fire, smouldering in dull red anger; but nobody minds.  Then the
\par swamp grows beautiful; a raised road, built by chained Negro convicts,
\par dips down into it, and forms a way walled and almost covered in living
\par green.  Spreading trees spring from a prodigal luxuriance of
\par undergrowth; great dark green shadows fade into the black background,
\par until all is one mass of tangled semi-tropical foliage, marvellous in
\par its weird savage splendor.  Once we crossed a black silent stream,
\par where the sad trees and writhing creepers, all glinting fiery yellow
\par and green, seemed like some vast cathedral,--some green Milan builded
\par of wildwood.  And as I crossed, I seemed to see again that fierce
\par tragedy of seventy years ago.  Osceola, the Indian-Negro chieftain, had
\par risen in the swamps of Florida, vowing vengeance.  His war-cry reached
\par the red Creeks of Dougherty, and their war-cry rang from the
\par Chattahoochee to the sea.  Men and women and children fled and fell
\par before them as they swept into Dougherty.  In yonder shadows a dark and
\par hideously painted warrior glided stealthily on,--another and another,
\par until three hundred had crept into the treacherous swamp.  Then the
\par false slime closing about them called the white men from the east.
\par Waist-deep, they fought beneath the tall trees, until the war-cry was
\par hushed and the Indians glided back into the west.  Small wonder the
\par wood is red.
\par 
\par Then came the black slaves.  Day after day the clank of chained feet
\par marching from Virginia and Carolina to Georgia was heard in these rich
\par swamp lands.  Day after day the songs of the callous, the wail of the
\par motherless, and the muttered curses of the wretched echoed from the
\par Flint to the Chickasawhatchee, until by 1860 there had risen in West
\par Dougherty perhaps the richest slave kingdom the modern world ever knew.
\par A hundred and fifty barons commanded the labor of nearly six thousand
\par Negroes, held sway over farms with ninety thousand acres tilled land,
\par valued even in times of cheap soil at three millions of dollars.
\par Twenty thousand bales of ginned cotton went yearly to England, New and
\par Old; and men that came there bankrupt made money and grew rich.  In a
\par single decade the cotton output increased four-fold and the value of
\par lands was tripled.  It was the heyday of the nouveau riche, and a life
\par of careless extravagance among the masters.  Four and six bobtailed
\par thoroughbreds rolled their coaches to town; open hospitality and gay
\par entertainment were the rule.  Parks and groves were laid out, rich with
\par flower and vine, and in the midst stood the low wide-halled "big
\par house," with its porch and columns and great fireplaces.
\par 
\par And yet with all this there was something sordid, something forced,--a
\par certain feverish unrest and recklessness; for was not all this show and
\par tinsel built upon a groan?  "This land was a little Hell," said a
\par ragged, brown, and grave-faced man to me.  We were seated near a
\par roadside blacksmith shop, and behind was the bare ruin of some master's
\par home.  "I've seen niggers drop dead in the furrow, but they were kicked
\par aside, and the plough never stopped.  Down in the guard-house, there's
\par where the blood ran."
\par 
\par With such foundations a kingdom must in time sway and fall.  The
\par masters moved to Macon and Augusta, and left only the irresponsible
\par overseers on the land.  And the result is such ruin as this, the Lloyd
\par "home-place":--great waving oaks, a spread of lawn, myrtles and
\par chestnuts, all ragged and wild; a solitary gate-post standing where
\par once was a castle entrance; an old rusty anvil lying amid rotting
\par bellows and wood in the ruins of a blacksmith shop; a wide rambling old
\par mansion, brown and dingy, filled now with the grandchildren of the
\par slaves who once waited on its tables; while the family of the master
\par has dwindled to two lone women, who live in Macon and feed hungrily off
\par the remnants of an earldom.  So we ride on, past phantom gates and
\par falling homes,--past the once flourishing farms of the Smiths, the
\par Gandys, and the Lagores,--and find all dilapidated and half ruined,
\par even there where a solitary white woman, a relic of other days, sits
\par alone in state among miles of Negroes and rides to town in her ancient
\par coach each day.
\par 
\par This was indeed the Egypt of the Confederacy,--the rich granary whence
\par potatoes and corn and cotton poured out to the famished and ragged
\par Confederate troops as they battled for a cause lost long before 1861.
\par Sheltered and secure, it became the place of refuge for families,
\par wealth, and slaves.  Yet even then the hard ruthless rape of the land
\par began to tell.  The red-clay sub-soil already had begun to peer above
\par the loam.  The harder the slaves were driven the more careless and
\par fatal was their farming.  Then came the revolution of war and
\par Emancipation, the bewilderment of Reconstruction,--and now, what is the
\par Egypt of the Confederacy, and what meaning has it for the nation's weal
\par or woe?
\par 
\par It is a land of rapid contrasts and of curiously mingled hope and pain.
\par Here sits a pretty blue-eyed quadroon hiding her bare feet; she was
\par married only last week, and yonder in the field is her dark young
\par husband, hoeing to support her, at thirty cents a day without board.
\par Across the way is Gatesby, brown and tall, lord of two thousand acres
\par shrewdly won and held.  There is a store conducted by his black son, a
\par blacksmith shop, and a ginnery.  Five miles below here is a town owned
\par and controlled by one white New Englander.  He owns almost a Rhode
\par Island county, with thousands of acres and hundreds of black laborers.
\par Their cabins look better than most, and the farm, with machinery and
\par fertilizers, is much more business-like than any in the county,
\par although the manager drives hard bargains in wages.  When now we turn
\par and look five miles above, there on the edge of town are five houses of
\par prostitutes,--two of blacks and three of whites; and in one of the
\par houses of the whites a worthless black boy was harbored too openly two
\par years ago; so he was hanged for rape.  And here, too, is the high
\par whitewashed fence of the "stockade," as the county prison is called;
\par the white folks say it is ever full of black criminals,--the black
\par folks say that only colored boys are sent to jail, and they not because
\par they are guilty, but because the State needs criminals to eke out its
\par income by their forced labor.
\par 
\par Immigrants are heirs of the slave baron in Dougherty; and as we ride
\par westward, by wide stretching cornfields and stubby orchards of peach
\par and pear, we see on all sides within the circle of dark forest a Land
\par of Canaan.  Here and there are tales of projects for money-getting,
\par born in the swift days of Reconstruction,--"improvement" companies,
\par wine companies, mills and factories; most failed, and foreigners fell
\par heir.  It is a beautiful land, this Dougherty, west of the Flint.  The
\par forests are wonderful, the solemn pines have disappeared, and this is
\par the "Oakey Woods," with its wealth of hickories, beeches, oaks and
\par palmettos.  But a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful land; the
\par merchants are in debt to the wholesalers, the planters are in debt to
\par the merchants, the tenants owe the planters, and laborers bow and bend
\par beneath the burden of it all.  Here and there a man has raised his head
\par above these murky waters.  We passed one fenced stock-farm with grass
\par and grazing cattle, that looked very home-like after endless corn and
\par cotton.  Here and there are black free-holders: there is the gaunt
\par dull-black Jackson, with his hundred acres.  "I says, 'Look up!  If you
\par don't look up you can't get up,'" remarks Jackson, philosophically.
\par And he's gotten up.  Dark Carter's neat barns would do credit to New
\par England.  His master helped him to get a start, but when the black man
\par died last fall the master's sons immediately laid claim to the estate.
\par "And them white folks will get it, too," said my yellow gossip.
\par 
\par I turn from these well-tended acres with a comfortable feeling that the
\par Negro is rising.  Even then, however, the fields, as we proceed, begin
\par to redden and the trees disappear.  Rows of old cabins appear filled
\par with renters and laborers,--cheerless, bare, and dirty, for the most
\par part, although here and there the very age and decay makes the scene
\par picturesque.  A young black fellow greets us.  He is twenty-two, and
\par just married.  Until last year he had good luck renting; then cotton
\par fell, and the sheriff seized and sold all he had.  So he moved here,
\par where the rent is higher, the land poorer, and the owner inflexible; he
\par rents a forty-dollar mule for twenty dollars a year.  Poor lad!--a
\par slave at twenty-two.  This plantation, owned now by a foreigner, was a
\par part of the famous Bolton estate.  After the war it was for many years
\par worked by gangs of Negro convicts,--and black convicts then were even
\par more plentiful than now; it was a way of making Negroes work, and the
\par question of guilt was a minor one.  Hard tales of cruelty and
\par mistreatment of the chained freemen are told, but the county
\par authorities were deaf until the free-labor market was nearly ruined by
\par wholesale migration.  Then they took the convicts from the plantations,
\par but not until one of the fairest regions of the "Oakey Woods" had been
\par ruined and ravished into a red waste, out of which only a Yankee or an
\par immigrant could squeeze more blood from debt-cursed tenants.
\par 
\par No wonder that Luke Black, slow, dull, and discouraged, shuffles to our
\par carriage and talks hopelessly.  Why should he strive?  Every year finds
\par him deeper in debt.  How strange that Georgia, the world-heralded
\par refuge of poor debtors, should bind her own to sloth and misfortune as
\par ruthlessly as ever England did!  The poor land groans with its
\par birth-pains, and brings forth scarcely a hundred pounds of cotton to
\par the acre, where fifty years ago it yielded eight times as much.  Of his
\par meagre yield the tenant pays from a quarter to a third in rent, and
\par most of the rest in interest on food and supplies bought on credit.
\par Twenty years yonder sunken-cheeked, old black man has labored under
\par that system, and now, turned day-laborer, is supporting his wife and
\par boarding himself on his wages of a dollar and a half a week, received
\par only part of the year.
\par 
\par The Bolton convict farm formerly included the neighboring plantation.
\par Here it was that the convicts were lodged in the great log prison still
\par standing.  A dismal place it still remains, with rows of ugly huts
\par filled with surly ignorant tenants.  "What rent do you pay here?" I
\par inquired.  "I don't know,--what is it, Sam?"  "All we make," answered
\par Sam.  It is a depressing place,--bare, unshaded, with no charm of past
\par association, only a memory of forced human toil,--now, then, and before
\par the war.  They are not happy, these black men whom we meet throughout
\par this region.  There is little of the joyous abandon and playfulness
\par which we are wont to associate with the plantation Negro.  At best, the
\par natural good-nature is edged with complaint or has changed into
\par sullenness and gloom.  And now and then it blazes forth in veiled but
\par hot anger.  I remember one big red-eyed black whom we met by the
\par roadside.  Forty-five years he had labored on this farm, beginning with
\par nothing, and still having nothing.  To be sure, he had given four
\par children a common-school training, and perhaps if the new fence-law had
\par not allowed unfenced crops in West Dougherty he might have raised a
\par little stock and kept ahead.  As it is, he is hopelessly in debt,
\par disappointed, and embittered.  He stopped us to inquire after the black
\par boy in Albany, whom it was said a policeman had shot and killed for
\par loud talking on the sidewalk.  And then he said slowly: "Let a white
\par man touch me, and he dies; I don't boast this,--I don't say it around
\par loud, or before the children,--but I mean it.  I've seen them whip my
\par father and my old mother in them cotton-rows till the blood ran; by--"
\par and we passed on.
\par 
\par Now Sears, whom we met next lolling under the chubby oak-trees, was of
\par quite different fibre.  Happy?--Well, yes; he laughed and flipped
\par pebbles, and thought the world was as it was.  He had worked here
\par twelve years and has nothing but a mortgaged mule.  Children?  Yes,
\par seven; but they hadn't been to school this year,--couldn't afford books
\par and clothes, and couldn't spare their work.  There go part of them to
\par the fields now,--three big boys astride mules, and a strapping girl
\par with bare brown legs.  Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce
\par hate and vindictiveness there;--these are the extremes of the Negro
\par problem which we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.
\par 
\par Here and there we meet distinct characters quite out of the ordinary.
\par One came out of a piece of newly cleared ground, making a wide detour
\par to avoid the snakes.  He was an old, hollow-cheeked man, with a drawn
\par and characterful brown face.  He had a sort of self-contained
\par quaintness and rough humor impossible to describe; a certain cynical
\par earnestness that puzzled one.  "The niggers were jealous of me over on
\par the other place," he said, "and so me and the old woman begged this
\par piece of woods, and I cleared it up myself.  Made nothing for two
\par years, but I reckon I've got a crop now."  The cotton looked tall and
\par rich, and we praised it.  He curtsied low, and then bowed almost to the
\par ground, with an imperturbable gravity that seemed almost suspicious.
\par Then he continued, "My mule died last week,"--a calamity in this land
\par equal to a devastating fire in town,--"but a white man loaned me
\par another."  Then he added, eyeing us, "Oh, I gets along with white
\par folks."  We turned the conversation.  "Bears? deer?" he answered,
\par "well, I should say there were," and he let fly a string of brave
\par oaths, as he told hunting-tales of the swamp.  We left him standing
\par still in the middle of the road looking after us, and yet apparently
\par not noticing us.
\par 
\par The Whistle place, which includes his bit of land, was bought soon
\par after the war by an English syndicate, the "Dixie Cotton and Corn
\par Company."  A marvellous deal of style their factor put on, with his
\par servants and coach-and-six; so much so that the concern soon landed in
\par inextricable bankruptcy.  Nobody lives in the old house now, but a man
\par comes each winter out of the North and collects his high rents.  I know
\par not which are the more touching,--such old empty houses, or the homes
\par of the masters' sons.  Sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those
\par white doors,--tales of poverty, of struggle, of disappointment.  A
\par revolution such as that of '63 is a terrible thing; they that rose rich
\par in the morning often slept in paupers' beds.  Beggars and vulgar
\par speculators rose to rule over them, and their children went astray.
\par See yonder sad-colored house, with its cabins and fences and glad
\par crops!  It is not glad within; last month the prodigal son of the
\par struggling father wrote home from the city for money.  Money!  Where
\par was it to come from?  And so the son rose in the night and killed his
\par baby, and killed his wife, and shot himself dead.  And the world passed
\par on.
\par 
\par I remember wheeling around a bend in the road beside a graceful bit of
\par forest and a singing brook.  A long low house faced us, with porch and
\par flying pillars, great oaken door, and a broad lawn shining in the
\par evening sun.  But the window-panes were gone, the pillars were
\par worm-eaten, and the moss-grown roof was falling in.  Half curiously I
\par peered through the unhinged door, and saw where, on the wall across the
\par hall, was written in once gay letters a faded "Welcome."
\par 
\par Quite a contrast to the southwestern part of Dougherty County is the
\par northwest.  Soberly timbered in oak and pine, it has none of that
\par half-tropical luxuriance of the southwest.  Then, too, there are fewer
\par signs of a romantic past, and more of systematic modern land-grabbing
\par and money-getting.  White people are more in evidence here, and farmer
\par and hired labor replace to some extent the absentee landlord and
\par rack-rented tenant.  The crops have neither the luxuriance of the
\par richer land nor the signs of neglect so often seen, and there were
\par fences and meadows here and there.  Most of this land was poor, and
\par beneath the notice of the slave-baron, before the war.  Since then his
\par poor relations and foreign immigrants have seized it.  The returns of
\par the farmer are too small to allow much for wages, and yet he will not
\par sell off small farms.  There is the Negro Sanford; he has worked
\par fourteen years as overseer on the Ladson place, and "paid out enough
\par for fertilizers to have bought a farm," but the owner will not sell off
\par a few acres.
\par 
\par Two children--a boy and a girl--are hoeing sturdily in the fields on
\par the farm where Corliss works.  He is smooth-faced and brown, and is
\par fencing up his pigs.  He used to run a successful cotton-gin, but the
\par Cotton Seed Oil Trust has forced the price of ginning so low that he
\par says it hardly pays him.  He points out a stately old house over the
\par way as the home of "Pa Willis."  We eagerly ride over, for "Pa Willis"
\par was the tall and powerful black Moses who led the Negroes for a
\par generation, and led them well.  He was a Baptist preacher, and when he
\par died, two thousand black people followed him to the grave; and now they
\par preach his funeral sermon each year.  His widow lives here,--a
\par weazened, sharp-featured little woman, who curtsied quaintly as we
\par greeted her.  Further on lives Jack Delson, the most prosperous Negro
\par farmer in the county.  It is a joy to meet him,--a great
\par broad-shouldered, handsome black man, intelligent and jovial.  Six
\par hundred and fifty acres he owns, and has eleven black tenants.  A neat
\par and tidy home nestled in a flower-garden, and a little store stands
\par beside it.
\par 
\par We pass the Munson place, where a plucky white widow is renting and
\par struggling; and the eleven hundred acres of the Sennet plantation, with
\par its Negro overseer.  Then the character of the farms begins to change.
\par Nearly all the lands belong to Russian Jews; the overseers are white,
\par and the cabins are bare board-houses scattered here and there.  The
\par rents are high, and day-laborers and "contract" hands abound.  It is a
\par keen, hard struggle for living here, and few have time to talk.  Tired
\par with the long ride, we gladly drive into Gillonsville.  It is a silent
\par cluster of farmhouses standing on the crossroads, with one of its
\par stores closed and the other kept by a Negro preacher.  They tell great
\par tales of busy times at Gillonsville before all the railroads came to
\par Albany; now it is chiefly a memory.  Riding down the street, we stop at
\par the preacher's and seat ourselves before the door.  It was one of those
\par scenes one cannot soon forget:--a wide, low, little house, whose
\par motherly roof reached over and sheltered a snug little porch.  There we
\par sat, after the long hot drive, drinking cool water,--the talkative
\par little storekeeper who is my daily companion; the silent old black
\par woman patching pantaloons and saying never a word; the ragged picture
\par of helpless misfortune who called in just to see the preacher; and
\par finally the neat matronly preacher's wife, plump, yellow, and
\par intelligent.  "Own land?" said the wife; "well, only this house."  Then
\par she added quietly.  "We did buy seven hundred acres across up yonder,
\par and paid for it; but they cheated us out of it.  Sells was the owner."
\par "Sells!" echoed the ragged misfortune, who was leaning against the
\par balustrade and listening, "he's a regular cheat.  I worked for him
\par thirty-seven days this spring, and he paid me in cardboard checks which
\par were to be cashed at the end of the month.  But he never cashed
\par them,--kept putting me off.  Then the sheriff came and took my mule and
\par corn and furniture--" "Furniture?  But furniture is exempt from seizure
\par by law."  "Well, he took it just the same," said the hard-faced man.

\par   WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY.
\par 
\par 
\par Have you ever seen a cotton-field white with harvest,--its golden
\par fleece hovering above the black earth like a silvery cloud edged with
\par dark green, its bold white signals waving like the foam of billows from
\par Carolina to Texas across that Black and human Sea?  I have sometimes
\par half suspected that here the winged ram Chrysomallus left that Fleece
\par after which Jason and his Argonauts went vaguely wandering into the
\par shadowy East three thousand years ago; and certainly one might frame a
\par pretty and not far-fetched analogy of witchery and dragons' teeth, and
\par blood and armed men, between the ancient and the modern quest of the
\par Golden Fleece in the Black Sea.
\par 
\par And now the golden fleece is found; not only found, but, in its
\par birthplace, woven.  For the hum of the cotton-mills is the newest and
\par most significant thing in the New South to-day.  All through the
\par Carolinas and Georgia, away down to Mexico, rise these gaunt red
\par buildings, bare and homely, and yet so busy and noisy withal that they
\par scarce seem to belong to the slow and sleepy land.  Perhaps they sprang
\par from dragons' teeth.  So the Cotton Kingdom still lives; the world
\par still bows beneath her sceptre.  Even the markets that once defied the
\par parvenu have crept one by one across the seas, and then slowly and
\par reluctantly, but surely, have started toward the Black Belt.
\par 
\par To be sure, there are those who wag their heads knowingly and tell us
\par that the capital of the Cotton Kingdom has moved from the Black to the
\par White Belt,--that the Negro of to-day raises not more than half of the
\par cotton crop.  Such men forget that the cotton crop has doubled, and
\par more than doubled, since the era of slavery, and that, even granting
\par their contention, the Negro is still supreme in a Cotton Kingdom larger
\par than that on which the Confederacy builded its hopes.  So the Negro
\par forms to-day one of the chief figures in a great world-industry; and
\par this, for its own sake, and in the light of historic interest, makes
\par the field-hands of the cotton country worth studying.
\par 
\par We seldom study the condition of the Negro to-day honestly and
\par carefully.  It is so much easier to assume that we know it all.  Or
\par perhaps, having already reached conclusions in our own minds, we are
\par loth to have them disturbed by facts.  And yet how little we really
\par know of these millions,--of their daily lives and longings, of their
\par homely joys and sorrows, of their real shortcomings and the meaning of
\par their crimes!  All this we can only learn by intimate contact with the
\par masses, and not by wholesale arguments covering millions separate in
\par time and space, and differing widely in training and culture.  To-day,
\par then, my reader, let us turn our faces to the Black Belt of Georgia and
\par seek simply to know the condition of the black farm-laborers of one
\par county there.
\par 
\par Here in 1890 lived ten thousand Negroes and two thousand whites.  The
\par country is rich, yet the people are poor.  The keynote of the Black
\par Belt is debt; not commercial credit, but debt in the sense of continued
\par inability on the part of the mass of the population to make income
\par cover expense.  This is the direct heritage of the South from the
\par wasteful economies of the slave regime; but it was emphasized and
\par brought to a crisis by the Emancipation of the slaves.  In 1860,
\par Dougherty County had six thousand slaves, worth at least two and a half
\par millions of dollars; its farms were estimated at three
\par millions,--making five and a half millions of property, the value of
\par which depended largely on the slave system, and on the speculative
\par demand for land once marvellously rich but already partially
\par devitalized by careless and exhaustive culture.  The war then meant a
\par financial crash; in place of the five and a half millions of 1860,
\par there remained in 1870 only farms valued at less than two millions.
\par With this came increased competition in cotton culture from the rich
\par lands of Texas; a steady fall in the normal price of cotton followed,
\par from about fourteen cents a pound in 1860 until it reached four cents
\par in 1898.  Such a financial revolution was it that involved the owners
\par of the cotton-belt in debt.  And if things went ill with the master,
\par how fared it with the man?
\par 
\par The plantations of Dougherty County in slavery days were not as
\par imposing and aristocratic as those of Virginia.  The Big House was
\par smaller and usually one-storied, and sat very near the slave cabins.
\par Sometimes these cabins stretched off on either side like wings;
\par sometimes only on one side, forming a double row, or edging the road
\par that turned into the plantation from the main thoroughfare.  The form
\par and disposition of the laborers' cabins throughout the Black Belt is
\par to-day the same as in slavery days.  Some live in the self-same cabins,
\par others in cabins rebuilt on the sites of the old.  All are sprinkled in
\par little groups over the face of the land, centering about some
\par dilapidated Big House where the head-tenant or agent lives.  The
\par general character and arrangement of these dwellings remains on the
\par whole unaltered.  There were in the county, outside the corporate town
\par of Albany, about fifteen hundred Negro families in 1898.  Out of all
\par these, only a single family occupied a house with seven rooms; only
\par fourteen have five rooms or more.  The mass live in one- and two-room
\par homes.
\par 
\par The size and arrangements of a people's homes are no unfair index of
\par their condition.  If, then, we inquire more carefully into these Negro
\par homes, we find much that is unsatisfactory.  All over the face of the
\par land is the one-room cabin,--now standing in the shadow of the Big
\par House, now staring at the dusty road, now rising dark and sombre amid
\par the green of the cotton-fields.  It is nearly always old and bare,
\par built of rough boards, and neither plastered nor ceiled.  Light and
\par ventilation are supplied by the single door and by the square hole in
\par the wall with its wooden shutter.  There is no glass, porch, or
\par ornamentation without.  Within is a fireplace, black and smoky, and
\par usually unsteady with age.  A bed or two, a table, a wooden chest, and
\par a few chairs compose the furniture; while a stray show-bill or a
\par newspaper makes up the decorations for the walls.  Now and then one may
\par find such a cabin kept scrupulously neat, with merry steaming
\par fireplaces and hospitable door; but the majority are dirty and
\par dilapidated, smelling of eating and sleeping, poorly ventilated, and
\par anything but homes.
\par 
\par Above all, the cabins are crowded.  We have come to associate crowding
\par with homes in cities almost exclusively.  This is primarily because we
\par have so little accurate knowledge of country life.  Here in Dougherty
\par County one may find families of eight and ten occupying one or two
\par rooms, and for every ten rooms of house accommodation for the Negroes
\par there are twenty-five persons.  The worst tenement abominations of New
\par York do not have above twenty-two persons for every ten rooms.  Of
\par course, one small, close room in a city, without a yard, is in many
\par respects worse than the larger single country room.  In other respects
\par it is better; it has glass windows, a decent chimney, and a trustworthy
\par floor.  The single great advantage of the Negro peasant is that he may
\par spend most of his life outside his hovel, in the open fields.
\par 
\par There are four chief causes of these wretched homes: First, long custom
\par born of slavery has assigned such homes to Negroes; white laborers
\par would be offered better accommodations, and might, for that and similar
\par reasons, give better work.  Secondly, the Negroes, used to such
\par accommodations, do not as a rule demand better; they do not know what
\par better houses mean.  Thirdly, the landlords as a class have not yet
\par come to realize that it is a good business investment to raise the
\par standard of living among labor by slow and judicious methods; that a
\par Negro laborer who demands three rooms and fifty cents a day would give
\par more efficient work and leave a larger profit than a discouraged toiler
\par herding his family in one room and working for thirty cents.  Lastly,
\par among such conditions of life there are few incentives to make the
\par laborer become a better farmer.  If he is ambitious, he moves to town
\par or tries other labor; as a tenant-farmer his outlook is almost
\par hopeless, and following it as a makeshift, he takes the house that is
\par given him without protest.
\par 
\par In such homes, then, these Negro peasants live.  The families are both
\par small and large; there are many single tenants,--widows and bachelors,
\par and remnants of broken groups.  The system of labor and the size of the
\par houses both tend to the breaking up of family groups: the grown
\par children go away as contract hands or migrate to town, the sister goes
\par into service; and so one finds many families with hosts of babies, and
\par many newly married couples, but comparatively few families with
\par half-grown and grown sons and daughters.  The average size of Negro
\par families has undoubtedly decreased since the war, primarily from
\par economic stress.  In Russia over a third of the bridegrooms and over
\par half the brides are under twenty; the same was true of the antebellum
\par Negroes.  Today, however, very few of the boys and less than a fifth of
\par the Negro girls under twenty are married.  The young men marry between
\par the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five; the young women between twenty
\par and thirty.  Such postponement is due to the difficulty of earning
\par sufficient to rear and support a family; and it undoubtedly leads, in
\par the country districts, to sexual immorality.  The form of this
\par immorality, however, is very seldom that of prostitution, and less
\par frequently that of illegitimacy than one would imagine.  Rather, it
\par takes the form of separation and desertion after a family group has
\par been formed.  The number of separated persons is thirty-five to the
\par thousand,--a very large number.  It would of course be unfair to
\par compare this number with divorce statistics, for many of these
\par separated women are in reality widowed, were the truth known, and in
\par other cases the separation is not permanent.  Nevertheless, here lies
\par the seat of greatest moral danger.  There is little or no prostitution
\par among these Negroes, and over three-fourths of the families, as found
\par by house-to-house investigation, deserve to be classed as decent people
\par with considerable regard for female chastity.  To be sure, the ideas of
\par the mass would not suit New England, and there are many loose habits
\par and notions.  Yet the rate of illegitimacy is undoubtedly lower than in
\par Austria or Italy, and the women as a class are modest.  The plague-spot
\par in sexual relations is easy marriage and easy separation.  This is no
\par sudden development, nor the fruit of Emancipation.  It is the plain
\par heritage from slavery.  In those days Sam, with his master's consent,
\par "took up" with Mary.  No ceremony was necessary, and in the busy life
\par of the great plantations of the Black Belt it was usually dispensed
\par with.  If now the master needed Sam's work in another plantation or in
\par another part of the same plantation, or if he took a notion to sell the
\par slave, Sam's married life with Mary was usually unceremoniously broken,
\par and then it was clearly to the master's interest to have both of them
\par take new mates.  This widespread custom of two centuries has not been
\par eradicated in thirty years.  To-day Sam's grandson "takes up" with a
\par woman without license or ceremony; they live together decently and
\par honestly, and are, to all intents and purposes, man and wife.
\par Sometimes these unions are never broken until death; but in too many
\par cases family quarrels, a roving spirit, a rival suitor, or perhaps more
\par frequently the hopeless battle to support a family, lead to separation,
\par and a broken household is the result.  The Negro church has done much
\par to stop this practice, and now most marriage ceremonies are performed
\par by the pastors.  Nevertheless, the evil is still deep seated, and only
\par a general raising of the standard of living will finally cure it.
\par 
\par Looking now at the county black population as a whole, it is fair to
\par characterize it as poor and ignorant.  Perhaps ten per cent compose the
\par well-to-do and the best of the laborers, while at least nine per cent
\par are thoroughly lewd and vicious.  The rest, over eighty per cent, are
\par poor and ignorant, fairly honest and well meaning, plodding, and to a
\par degree shiftless, with some but not great sexual looseness.  Such class
\par lines are by no means fixed; they vary, one might almost say, with the
\par price of cotton.  The degree of ignorance cannot easily be expressed.
\par We may say, for instance, that nearly two-thirds of them cannot read or
\par write.  This but partially expresses the fact.  They are ignorant of
\par the world about them, of modern economic organization, of the function
\par of government, of individual worth and possibilities,--of nearly all
\par those things which slavery in self-defence had to keep them from
\par learning.  Much that the white boy imbibes from his earliest social
\par atmosphere forms the puzzling problems of the black boy's mature years.
\par America is not another word for Opportunity to all her sons.
\par 
\par It is easy for us to lose ourselves in details in endeavoring to grasp
\par and comprehend the real condition of a mass of human beings.  We often
\par forget that each unit in the mass is a throbbing human soul.  Ignorant
\par it may be, and poverty stricken, black and curious in limb and ways and
\par thought; and yet it loves and hates, it toils and tires, it laughs and
\par weeps its bitter tears, and looks in vague and awful longing at the
\par grim horizon of its life,--all this, even as you and I. These black
\par thousands are not in reality lazy; they are improvident and careless;
\par they insist on breaking the monotony of toil with a glimpse at the
\par great town-world on Saturday; they have their loafers and their
\par rascals; but the great mass of them work continuously and faithfully
\par for a return, and under circumstances that would call forth equal
\par voluntary effort from few if any other modern laboring class.  Over
\par eighty-eight per cent of them--men, women, and children--are farmers.
\par Indeed, this is almost the only industry.  Most of the children get
\par their schooling after the "crops are laid by," and very few there are
\par that stay in school after the spring work has begun.  Child-labor is to
\par be found here in some of its worst phases, as fostering ignorance and
\par stunting physical development.  With the grown men of the county there
\par is little variety in work: thirteen hundred are farmers, and two
\par hundred are laborers, teamsters, etc., including twenty-four artisans,
\par ten merchants, twenty-one preachers, and four teachers.  This
\par narrowness of life reaches its maximum among the women: thirteen
\par hundred and fifty of these are farm laborers, one hundred are servants
\par and washerwomen, leaving sixty-five housewives, eight teachers, and six
\par seamstresses.
\par 
\par Among this people there is no leisure class.  We often forget that in
\par the United States over half the youth and adults are not in the world
\par earning incomes, but are making homes, learning of the world, or
\par resting after the heat of the strife.  But here ninety-six per cent are
\par toiling; no one with leisure to turn the bare and cheerless cabin into
\par a home, no old folks to sit beside the fire and hand down traditions of
\par the past; little of careless happy childhood and dreaming youth.  The
\par dull monotony of daily toil is broken only by the gayety of the
\par thoughtless and the Saturday trip to town.  The toil, like all farm
\par toil, is monotonous, and here there are little machinery and few tools
\par to relieve its burdensome drudgery.  But with all this, it is work in
\par the pure open air, and this is something in a day when fresh air is
\par scarce.
\par 
\par The land on the whole is still fertile, despite long abuse.  For nine
\par or ten months in succession the crops will come if asked: garden
\par vegetables in April, grain in May, melons in June and July, hay in
\par August, sweet potatoes in September, and cotton from then to Christmas.
\par And yet on two-thirds of the land there is but one crop, and that
\par leaves the toilers in debt.  Why is this?
\par 
\par Away down the Baysan road, where the broad flat fields are flanked by
\par great oak forests, is a plantation; many thousands of acres it used to
\par run, here and there, and beyond the great wood.  Thirteen hundred human
\par beings here obeyed the call of one,--were his in body, and largely in
\par soul.  One of them lives there yet,--a short, stocky man, his
\par dull-brown face seamed and drawn, and his tightly curled hair
\par gray-white.  The crops?  Just tolerable, he said; just tolerable.
\par Getting on?  No--he wasn't getting on at all.  Smith of Albany
\par "furnishes" him, and his rent is eight hundred pounds of cotton.  Can't
\par make anything at that.  Why didn't he buy land!  Humph!  Takes money to
\par buy land.  And he turns away.  Free!  The most piteous thing amid all
\par the black ruin of war-time, amid the broken fortunes of the masters,
\par the blighted hopes of mothers and maidens, and the fall of an
\par empire,--the most piteous thing amid all this was the black freedman
\par who threw down his hoe because the world called him free.  What did
\par such a mockery of freedom mean?  Not a cent of money, not an inch of
\par land, not a mouthful of victuals,--not even ownership of the rags on
\par his back.  Free!  On Saturday, once or twice a month, the old master,
\par before the war, used to dole out bacon and meal to his Negroes.  And
\par after the first flush of freedom wore off, and his true helplessness
\par dawned on the freedman, he came back and picked up his hoe, and old
\par master still doled out his bacon and meal.  The legal form of service
\par was theoretically far different; in practice, task-work or "cropping"
\par was substituted for daily toil in gangs; and the slave gradually became
\par a metayer, or tenant on shares, in name, but a laborer with
\par indeterminate wages in fact.
\par 
\par Still the price of cotton fell, and gradually the landlords deserted
\par their plantations, and the reign of the merchant began.  The merchant
\par of the Black Belt is a curious institution,--part banker, part
\par landlord, part banker, and part despot.  His store, which used most
\par frequently to stand at the cross-roads and become the centre of a
\par weekly village, has now moved to town; and thither the Negro tenant
\par follows him.  The merchant keeps everything,--clothes and shoes, coffee
\par and sugar, pork and meal, canned and dried goods, wagons and ploughs,
\par seed and fertilizer,--and what he has not in stock he can give you an
\par order for at the store across the way.  Here, then, comes the tenant,
\par Sam Scott, after he has contracted with some absent landlord's agent
\par for hiring forty acres of land; he fingers his hat nervously until the
\par merchant finishes his morning chat with Colonel Saunders, and calls
\par out, "Well, Sam, what do you want?"  Sam wants him to "furnish"
\par him,--i.e., to advance him food and clothing for the year, and perhaps
\par seed and tools, until his crop is raised and sold.  If Sam seems a
\par favorable subject, he and the merchant go to a lawyer, and Sam executes
\par a chattel mortgage on his mule and wagon in return for seed and a
\par week's rations.  As soon as the green cotton-leaves appear above the
\par ground, another mortgage is given on the "crop."  Every Saturday, or at
\par longer intervals, Sam calls upon the merchant for his "rations"; a
\par family of five usually gets about thirty pounds of fat side-pork and a
\par couple of bushels of cornmeal a month.  Besides this, clothing and
\par shoes must be furnished; if Sam or his family is sick, there are orders
\par on the druggist and doctor; if the mule wants shoeing, an order on the
\par blacksmith, etc.  If Sam is a hard worker and crops promise well, he is
\par often encouraged to buy more,--sugar, extra clothes, perhaps a buggy.
\par But he is seldom encouraged to save.  When cotton rose to ten cents
\par last fall, the shrewd merchants of Dougherty County sold a thousand
\par buggies in one season, mostly to black men.
\par 
\par The security offered for such transactions--a crop and chattel
\par mortgage--may at first seem slight.  And, indeed, the merchants tell
\par many a true tale of shiftlessness and cheating; of cotton picked at
\par night, mules disappearing, and tenants absconding.  But on the whole
\par the merchant of the Black Belt is the most prosperous man in the
\par section.  So skilfully and so closely has he drawn the bonds of the law
\par about the tenant, that the black man has often simply to choose between
\par pauperism and crime; he "waives" all homestead exemptions in his
\par contract; he cannot touch his own mortgaged crop, which the laws put
\par almost in the full control of the land-owner and of the merchant.  When
\par the crop is growing the merchant watches it like a hawk; as soon as it
\par is ready for market he takes possession of it, sells it, pays the
\par landowner his rent, subtracts his bill for supplies, and if, as
\par sometimes happens, there is anything left, he hands it over to the
\par black serf for his Christmas celebration.
\par 
\par The direct result of this system is an all-cotton scheme of agriculture
\par and the continued bankruptcy of the tenant.  The currency of the Black
\par Belt is cotton.  It is a crop always salable for ready money, not
\par usually subject to great yearly fluctuations in price, and one which
\par the Negroes know how to raise.  The landlord therefore demands his rent
\par in cotton, and the merchant will accept mortgages on no other crop.
\par There is no use asking the black tenant, then, to diversify his
\par crops,--he cannot under this system.  Moreover, the system is bound to
\par bankrupt the tenant.  I remember once meeting a little one-mule wagon
\par on the River road.  A young black fellow sat in it driving listlessly,
\par his elbows on his knees.  His dark-faced wife sat beside him, stolid,
\par silent.
\par 
\par "Hello!" cried my driver,--he has a most imprudent way of addressing
\par these people, though they seem used to it,--"what have you got there?"
\par 
\par "Meat and meal," answered the man, stopping.  The meat lay uncovered in
\par the bottom of the wagon,--a great thin side of fat pork covered with
\par salt; the meal was in a white bushel bag.
\par 
\par "What did you pay for that meat?"
\par 
\par "Ten cents a pound."  It could have been bought for six or seven cents
\par cash.
\par 
\par "And the meal?"
\par 
\par "Two dollars."  One dollar and ten cents is the cash price in town.
\par Here was a man paying five dollars for goods which he could have bought
\par for three dollars cash, and raised for one dollar or one dollar and a
\par half.
\par 
\par Yet it is not wholly his fault.  The Negro farmer started
\par behind,--started in debt.  This was not his choosing, but the crime of
\par this happy-go-lucky nation which goes blundering along with its
\par Reconstruction tragedies, its Spanish war interludes and Philippine
\par matinees, just as though God really were dead.  Once in debt, it is no
\par easy matter for a whole race to emerge.
\par 
\par In the year of low-priced cotton, 1898, out of three hundred tenant
\par families one hundred and seventy-five ended their year's work in debt
\par to the extent of fourteen thousand dollars; fifty cleared nothing, and
\par the remaining seventy-five made a total profit of sixteen hundred
\par dollars.  The net indebtedness of the black tenant families of the
\par whole county must have been at least sixty thousand dollars.  In a more
\par prosperous year the situation is far better; but on the average the
\par majority of tenants end the year even, or in debt, which means that
\par they work for board and clothes.  Such an economic organization is
\par radically wrong.  Whose is the blame?
\par 
\par The underlying causes of this situation are complicated but
\par discernible.  And one of the chief, outside the carelessness of the
\par nation in letting the slave start with nothing, is the widespread
\par opinion among the merchants and employers of the Black Belt that only
\par by the slavery of debt can the Negro be kept at work.  Without doubt,
\par some pressure was necessary at the beginning of the free-labor system
\par to keep the listless and lazy at work; and even to-day the mass of the
\par Negro laborers need stricter guardianship than most Northern laborers.
\par Behind this honest and widespread opinion dishonesty and cheating of
\par the ignorant laborers have a good chance to take refuge.  And to all
\par this must be added the obvious fact that a slave ancestry and a system
\par of unrequited toil has not improved the efficiency or temper of the
\par mass of black laborers.  Nor is this peculiar to Sambo; it has in
\par history been just as true of John and Hans, of Jacques and Pat, of all
\par ground-down peasantries.  Such is the situation of the mass of the
\par Negroes in the Black Belt to-day; and they are thinking about it.
\par Crime, and a cheap and dangerous socialism, are the inevitable results
\par of this pondering.  I see now that ragged black man sitting on a log,
\par aimlessly whittling a stick.  He muttered to me with the murmur of many
\par ages, when he said: "White man sit down whole year; Nigger work day and
\par night and make crop; Nigger hardly gits bread and meat; white man
\par sittin' down gits all. It's wrong." And what do the better classes of
\par Negroes do to improve their situation?  One of two things: if any way
\par possible, they buy land; if not, they migrate to town.  Just as
\par centuries ago it was no easy thing for the serf to escape into the
\par freedom of town-life, even so to-day there are hindrances laid in the
\par way of county laborers.  In considerable parts of all the Gulf States,
\par and especially in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, the Negroes on
\par the plantations in the back-country districts are still held at forced
\par labor practically without wages.  Especially is this true in districts
\par where the farmers are composed of the more ignorant class of poor
\par whites, and the Negroes are beyond the reach of schools and intercourse
\par with their advancing fellows.  If such a peon should run away, the
\par sheriff, elected by white suffrage, can usually be depended on to catch
\par the fugitive, return him, and ask no questions.  If he escape to
\par another county, a charge of petty thieving, easily true, can be
\par depended upon to secure his return.  Even if some unduly officious
\par person insist upon a trial, neighborly comity will probably make his
\par conviction sure, and then the labor due the county can easily be bought
\par by the master.  Such a system is impossible in the more civilized parts
\par of the South, or near the large towns and cities; but in those vast
\par stretches of land beyond the telegraph and the newspaper the spirit of
\par the Thirteenth Amendment is sadly broken.  This represents the lowest
\par economic depths of the black American peasant; and in a study of the
\par rise and condition of the Negro freeholder we must trace his economic
\par progress from the modern serfdom.
\par 
\par Even in the better-ordered country districts of the South the free
\par movement of agricultural laborers is hindered by the migration-agent
\par laws.  The "Associated Press" recently informed the world of the arrest
\par of a young white man in Southern Georgia who represented the "Atlantic
\par Naval Supplies Company," and who "was caught in the act of enticing
\par hands from the turpentine farm of Mr. John Greer."  The crime for which
\par this young man was arrested is taxed five hundred dollars for each
\par county in which the employment agent proposes to gather laborers for
\par work outside the State.  Thus the Negroes' ignorance of the
\par labor-market outside his own vicinity is increased rather than
\par diminished by the laws of nearly every Southern State.
\par 
\par Similar to such measures is the unwritten law of the back districts and
\par small towns of the South, that the character of all Negroes unknown to
\par the mass of the community must be vouched for by some white man.  This
\par is really a revival of the old Roman idea of the patron under whose
\par protection the new-made freedman was put.  In many instances this
\par system has been of great good to the Negro, and very often under the
\par protection and guidance of the former master's family, or other white
\par friends, the freedman progressed in wealth and morality.  But the same
\par system has in other cases resulted in the refusal of whole communities
\par to recognize the right of a Negro to change his habitation and to be
\par master of his own fortunes.  A black stranger in Baker County, Georgia,
\par for instance, is liable to be stopped anywhere on the public highway
\par and made to state his business to the satisfaction of any white
\par interrogator.  If he fails to give a suitable answer, or seems too
\par independent or "sassy," he may be arrested or summarily driven away.
\par 
\par Thus it is that in the country districts of the South, by written or
\par unwritten law, peonage, hindrances to the migration of labor, and a
\par system of white patronage exists over large areas.  Besides this, the
\par chance for lawless oppression and illegal exactions is vastly greater
\par in the country than in the city, and nearly all the more serious race
\par disturbances of the last decade have arisen from disputes in the count
\par between master and man,--as, for instance, the Sam Hose affair.  As a
\par result of such a situation, there arose, first, the Black Belt; and,
\par second, the Migration to Town.  The Black Belt was not, as many
\par assumed, a movement toward fields of labor under more genial climatic
\par conditions; it was primarily a huddling for self-protection,--a massing
\par of the black population for mutual defence in order to secure the peace
\par and tranquillity necessary to economic advance.  This movement took
\par place between Emancipation and 1880, and only partially accomplished
\par the desired results.  The rush to town since 1880 is the
\par counter-movement of men disappointed in the economic opportunities of
\par the Black Belt.
\par 
\par In Dougherty County, Georgia, one can see easily the results of this
\par experiment in huddling for protection.  Only ten per cent of the adult
\par population was born in the county, and yet the blacks outnumber the
\par whites four or five to one.  There is undoubtedly a security to the
\par blacks in their very numbers,--a personal freedom from arbitrary
\par treatment, which makes hundreds of laborers cling to Dougherty in spite
\par of low wages and economic distress.  But a change is coming, and slowly
\par but surely even here the agricultural laborers are drifting to town and
\par leaving the broad acres behind.  Why is this?  Why do not the Negroes
\par become land-owners, and build up the black landed peasantry, which has
\par for a generation and more been the dream of philanthropist and
\par statesman?
\par 
\par To the car-window sociologist, to the man who seeks to understand and
\par know the South by devoting the few leisure hours of a holiday trip to
\par unravelling the snarl of centuries,--to such men very often the whole
\par trouble with the black field-hand may be summed up by Aunt Ophelia's
\par word, "Shiftless!"  They have noted repeatedly scenes like one I saw
\par last summer.  We were riding along the highroad to town at the close of
\par a long hot day.  A couple of young black fellows passed us in a
\par muleteam, with several bushels of loose corn in the ear.  One was
\par driving, listlessly bent forward, his elbows on his knees,--a
\par happy-go-lucky, careless picture of irresponsibility.  The other was
\par fast asleep in the bottom of the wagon.  As we passed we noticed an ear
\par of corn fall from the wagon.  They never saw it,--not they.  A rod
\par farther on we noted another ear on the ground; and between that
\par creeping mule and town we counted twenty-six ears of corn.  Shiftless?
\par Yes, the personification of shiftlessness.  And yet follow those boys:
\par they are not lazy; to-morrow morning they'll be up with the sun; they
\par work hard when they do work, and they work willingly.  They have no
\par sordid, selfish, money-getting ways, but rather a fine disdain for mere
\par cash.  They'll loaf before your face and work behind your back with
\par good-natured honesty.  They'll steal a watermelon, and hand you back
\par your lost purse intact.  Their great defect as laborers lies in their
\par lack of incentive beyond the mere pleasure of physical exertion.  They
\par are careless because they have not found that it pays to be careful;
\par they are improvident because the improvident ones of their acquaintance
\par get on about as well as the provident.  Above all, they cannot see why
\par they should take unusual pains to make the white man's land better, or
\par to fatten his mule, or save his corn.  On the other hand, the white
\par land-owner argues that any attempt to improve these laborers by
\par increased responsibility, or higher wages, or better homes, or land of
\par their own, would be sure to result in failure.  He shows his Northern
\par visitor the scarred and wretched land; the ruined mansions, the
\par worn-out soil and mortgaged acres, and says, This is Negro freedom!
\par 
\par Now it happens that both master and man have just enough argument on
\par their respective sides to make it difficult for them to understand each
\par other.  The Negro dimly personifies in the white man all his ills and
\par misfortunes; if he is poor, it is because the white man seizes the
\par fruit of his toil; if he is ignorant, it is because the white man gives
\par him neither time nor facilities to learn; and, indeed, if any
\par misfortune happens to him, it is because of some hidden machinations of
\par "white folks."  On the other hand, the masters and the masters' sons
\par have never been able to see why the Negro, instead of settling down to
\par be day-laborers for bread and clothes, are infected with a silly desire
\par to rise in the world, and why they are sulky, dissatisfied, and
\par careless, where their fathers were happy and dumb and faithful.  "Why,
\par you niggers have an easier time than I do," said a puzzled Albany
\par merchant to his black customer.  "Yes," he replied, "and so does yo'
\par hogs."
\par 
\par Taking, then, the dissatisfied and shiftless field-hand as a
\par starting-point, let us inquire how the black thousands of Dougherty
\par have struggled from him up toward their ideal, and what that ideal is.
\par All social struggle is evidenced by the rise, first of economic, then
\par of social classes, among a homogeneous population.  To-day the
\par following economic classes are plainly differentiated among these
\par Negroes.
\par 
\par A "submerged tenth" of croppers, with a few paupers; forty per cent who
\par are metayers and thirty-nine per cent of semi-metayers and
\par wage-laborers.  There are left five per cent of money-renters and six
\par per cent of freeholders,--the "Upper Ten" of the land.  The croppers
\par are entirely without capital, even in the limited sense of food or
\par money to keep them from seed-time to harvest.  All they furnish is
\par their labor; the land-owner furnishes land, stock, tools, seed, and
\par house; and at the end of the year the laborer gets from a third to a
\par half of the crop.  Out of his share, however, comes pay and interest
\par for food and clothing advanced him during the year.  Thus we have a
\par laborer without capital and without wages, and an employer whose
\par capital is largely his employees' wages.  It is an unsatisfactory
\par arrangement, both for hirer and hired, and is usually in vogue on poor
\par land with hard-pressed owners.
\par 
\par Above the croppers come the great mass of the black population who work
\par the land on their own responsibility, paying rent in cotton and
\par supported by the crop-mortgage system.  After the war this system was
\par attractive to the freedmen on account of its larger freedom and its
\par possibility for making a surplus.  But with the carrying out of the
\par crop-lien system, the deterioration of the land, and the slavery of
\par debt, the position of the metayers has sunk to a dead level of
\par practically unrewarded toil.  Formerly all tenants had some capital,
\par and often considerable; but absentee landlordism, rising rack-rent, and
\par failing cotton have stripped them well-nigh of all, and probably not
\par over half of them to-day own their mules.  The change from cropper to
\par tenant was accomplished by fixing the rent.  If, now, the rent fixed
\par was reasonable, this was an incentive to the tenant to strive.  On the
\par other hand, if the rent was too high, or if the land deteriorated, the
\par result was to discourage and check the efforts of the black peasantry.
\par There is no doubt that the latter case is true; that in Dougherty
\par County every economic advantage of the price of cotton in market and of
\par the strivings of the tenant has been taken advantage of by the
\par landlords and merchants, and swallowed up in rent and interest.  If
\par cotton rose in price, the rent rose even higher; if cotton fell, the
\par rent remained or followed reluctantly.  If the tenant worked hard and
\par raised a large crop, his rent was raised the next year; if that year
\par the crop failed, his corn was confiscated and his mule sold for debt.
\par There were, of course, exceptions to this,--cases of personal kindness
\par and forbearance; but in the vast majority of cases the rule was to
\par extract the uttermost farthing from the mass of the black farm laborers.
\par 
\par The average metayer pays from twenty to thirty per cent of his crop in
\par rent.  The result of such rack-rent can only be evil,--abuse and
\par neglect of the soil, deterioration in the character of the laborers,
\par and a widespread sense of injustice.  "Wherever the country is poor,"
\par cried Arthur Young, "it is in the hands of metayers," and "their
\par condition is more wretched than that of day-laborers."  He was talking
\par of Italy a century ago; but he might have been talking of Dougherty
\par County to-day.  And especially is that true to-day which he declares
\par was true in France before the Revolution: "The metayers are considered
\par as little better than menial servants, removable at pleasure, and
\par obliged to conform in all things to the will of the landlords."  On
\par this low plane half the black population of Dougherty County--perhaps
\par more than half the black millions of this land--are to-day struggling.
\par 
\par A degree above these we may place those laborers who receive money
\par wages for their work.  Some receive a house with perhaps a garden-spot;
\par then supplies of food and clothing are advanced, and certain fixed
\par wages are given at the end of the year, varying from thirty to sixty
\par dollars, out of which the supplies must be paid for, with interest.
\par About eighteen per cent of the population belong to this class of
\par semi-metayers, while twenty-two per cent are laborers paid by the month
\par or year, and are either "furnished" by their own savings or perhaps
\par more usually by some merchant who takes his chances of payment.  Such
\par laborers receive from thirty-five to fifty cents a day during the
\par working season.  They are usually young unmarried persons, some being
\par women; and when they marry they sink to the class of metayers, or, more
\par seldom, become renters.
\par 
\par The renters for fixed money rentals are the first of the emerging
\par classes, and form five per cent of the families.  The sole advantage of
\par this small class is their freedom to choose their crops, and the
\par increased responsibility which comes through having money transactions.
\par While some of the renters differ little in condition from the metayers,
\par yet on the whole they are more intelligent and responsible persons, and
\par are the ones who eventually become land-owners.  Their better character
\par and greater shrewdness enable them to gain, perhaps to demand, better
\par terms in rents; rented farms, varying from forty to a hundred acres,
\par bear an average rental of about fifty-four dollars a year.  The men who
\par conduct such farms do not long remain renters; either they sink to
\par metayers, or with a successful series of harvests rise to be
\par land-owners.
\par 
\par In 1870 the tax-books of Dougherty report no Negroes as landholders.
\par If there were any such at that time,--and there may have been a
\par few,--their land was probably held in the name of some white patron,--a
\par method not uncommon during slavery.  In 1875 ownership of land had
\par begun with seven hundred and fifty acres; ten years later this had
\par increased to over sixty-five hundred acres, to nine thousand acres in
\par 1890 and ten thousand in 1900.  The total assessed property has in this
\par same period risen from eighty thousand dollars in 1875 to two hundred
\par and forty thousand dollars in 1900.
\par 
\par Two circumstances complicate this development and make it in some
\par respects difficult to be sure of the real tendencies; they are the
\par panic of 1893, and the low price of cotton in 1898.  Besides this, the
\par system of assessing property in the country districts of Georgia is
\par somewhat antiquated and of uncertain statistical value; there are no
\par assessors, and each man makes a sworn return to a tax-receiver.  Thus
\par public opinion plays a large part, and the returns vary strangely from
\par year to year.  Certainly these figures show the small amount of
\par accumulated capital among the Negroes, and the consequent large
\par dependence of their property on temporary prosperity.  They have little
\par to tide over a few years of economic depression, and are at the mercy
\par of the cotton-market far more than the whites.  And thus the
\par land-owners, despite their marvellous efforts, are really a transient
\par class, continually being depleted by those who fall back into the class
\par of renters or metayers, and augmented by newcomers from the masses.  Of
\par one hundred land-owners in 1898, half had bought their land since 1893,
\par a fourth between 1890 and 1893, a fifth between 1884 and 1890, and the
\par rest between 1870 and 1884.  In all, one hundred and eighty-five
\par Negroes have owned land in this county since 1875.
\par 
\par If all the black land-owners who had ever held land here had kept it or
\par left it in the hands of black men, the Negroes would have owned nearer
\par thirty thousand acres than the fifteen thousand they now hold.  And yet
\par these fifteen thousand acres are a creditable showing,--a proof of no
\par little weight of the worth and ability of the Negro people.  If they
\par had been given an economic start at Emancipation, if they had been in
\par an enlightened and rich community which really desired their best good,
\par then we might perhaps call such a result small or even insignificant.
\par But for a few thousand poor ignorant field-hands, in the face of
\par poverty, a falling market, and social stress, to save and capitalize
\par two hundred thousand dollars in a generation has meant a tremendous
\par effort.  The rise of a nation, the pressing forward of a social class,
\par means a bitter struggle, a hard and soul-sickening battle with the
\par world such as few of the more favored classes know or appreciate.
\par 
\par Out of the hard economic conditions of this portion of the Black Belt,
\par only six per cent of the population have succeeded in emerging into
\par peasant proprietorship; and these are not all firmly fixed, but grow
\par and shrink in number with the wavering of the cotton-market.  Fully
\par ninety-four per cent have struggled for land and failed, and half of
\par them sit in hopeless serfdom.  For these there is one other avenue of
\par escape toward which they have turned in increasing numbers, namely,
\par migration to town.  A glance at the distribution of land among the
\par black owners curiously reveals this fact.  In 1898 the holdings were as
\par follows: Under forty acres, forty-nine families; forty to two hundred
\par and fifty acres, seventeen families; two hundred and fifty to one
\par thousand acres, thirteen families; one thousand or more acres, two
\par families.  Now in 1890 there were forty-four holdings, but only nine of
\par these were under forty acres.  The great increase of holdings, then,
\par has come in the buying of small homesteads near town, where their
\par owners really share in the town life; this is a part of the rush to
\par town.  And for every land-owner who has thus hurried away from the
\par narrow and hard conditions of country life, how many field-hands, how
\par many tenants, how many ruined renters, have joined that long
\par procession?  Is it not strange compensation?  The sin of the country
\par districts is visited on the town, and the social sores of city life
\par to-day may, here in Dougherty County, and perhaps in many places near
\par and far, look for their final healing without the city walls.

\par   We press too close in church and mart
\par   To keep a dream or grave apart.
\par 
\par   MRS. BROWNING.
\par 
\par 
\par The world-old phenomenon of the contact of diverse races of men is to
\par have new exemplification during the new century.  Indeed, the
\par characteristic of our age is the contact of European civilization with
\par the world's undeveloped peoples.  Whatever we may say of the results of
\par such contact in the past, it certainly forms a chapter in human action
\par not pleasant to look back upon.  War, murder, slavery, extermination,
\par and debauchery,--this has again and again been the result of carrying
\par civilization and the blessed gospel to the isles of the sea and the
\par heathen without the law.  Nor does it altogether satisfy the conscience
\par of the modern world to be told complacently that all this has been
\par right and proper, the fated triumph of strength over weakness, of
\par righteousness over evil, of superiors over inferiors.  It would
\par certainly be soothing if one could readily believe all this; and yet
\par there are too many ugly facts for everything to be thus easily
\par explained away.  We feel and know that there are many delicate
\par differences in race psychology, numberless changes that our crude
\par social measurements are not yet able to follow minutely, which explain
\par much of history and social development.  At the same time, too, we know
\par that these considerations have never adequately explained or excused
\par the triumph of brute force and cunning over weakness and innocence.
\par 
\par It is, then, the strife of all honorable men of the twentieth century
\par to see that in the future competition of races the survival of the
\par fittest shall mean the triumph of the good, the beautiful, and the
\par true; that we may be able to preserve for future civilization all that
\par is really fine and noble and strong, and not continue to put a premium
\par on greed and impudence and cruelty.  To bring this hope to fruition, we
\par are compelled daily to turn more and more to a conscientious study of
\par the phenomena of race-contact,--to a study frank and fair, and not
\par falsified and colored by our wishes or our fears.  And we have in the
\par South as fine a field for such a study as the world affords,--a field,
\par to be sure, which the average American scientist deems somewhat beneath
\par his dignity, and which the average man who is not a scientist knows all
\par about, but nevertheless a line of study which by reason of the enormous
\par race complications with which God seems about to punish this nation
\par must increasingly claim our sober attention, study, and thought, we
\par must ask, what are the actual relations of whites and blacks in the
\par South? and we must be answered, not by apology or fault-finding, but by
\par a plain, unvarnished tale.
\par 
\par In the civilized life of to-day the contact of men and their relations
\par to each other fall in a few main lines of action and communication:
\par there is, first, the physical proximity of home and dwelling-places,
\par the way in which neighborhoods group themselves, and the contiguity of
\par neighborhoods.  Secondly, and in our age chiefest, there are the
\par economic relations,--the methods by which individuals cooperate for
\par earning a living, for the mutual satisfaction of wants, for the
\par production of wealth.  Next, there are the political relations, the
\par cooperation in social control, in group government, in laying and
\par paying the burden of taxation.  In the fourth place there are the less
\par tangible but highly important forms of intellectual contact and
\par commerce, the interchange of ideas through conversation and conference,
\par through periodicals and libraries; and, above all, the gradual
\par formation for each community of that curious tertium quid which we call
\par public opinion.  Closely allied with this come the various forms of
\par social contact in everyday life, in travel, in theatres, in house
\par gatherings, in marrying and giving in marriage.  Finally, there are the
\par varying forms of religious enterprise, of moral teaching and benevolent
\par endeavor.  These are the principal ways in which men living in the same
\par communities are brought into contact with each other.  It is my present
\par task, therefore, to indicate, from my point of view, how the black race
\par in the South meet and mingle with the whites in these matters of
\par everyday life.
\par 
\par First, as to physical dwelling.  It is usually possible to draw in
\par nearly every Southern community a physical color-line on the map, on
\par the one side of which whites dwell and on the other Negroes.  The
\par winding and intricacy of the geographical color-line varies, of course,
\par in different communities.  I know some towns where a straight line
\par drawn through the middle of the main street separates nine-tenths of
\par the whites from nine-tenths of the blacks.  In other towns the older
\par settlement of whites has been encircled by a broad band of blacks; in
\par still other cases little settlements or nuclei of blacks have sprung up
\par amid surrounding whites.  Usually in cities each street has its
\par distinctive color, and only now and then do the colors meet in close
\par proximity.  Even in the country something of this segregation is
\par manifest in the smaller areas, and of course in the larger phenomena of
\par the Black Belt.
\par 
\par All this segregation by color is largely independent of that natural
\par clustering by social grades common to all communities.  A Negro slum
\par may be in dangerous proximity to a white residence quarter, while it is
\par quite common to find a white slum planted in the heart of a respectable
\par Negro district.  One thing, however, seldom occurs: the best of the
\par whites and the best of the Negroes almost never live in anything like
\par close proximity.  It thus happens that in nearly every Southern town
\par and city, both whites and blacks see commonly the worst of each other.
\par This is a vast change from the situation in the past, when, through the
\par close contact of master and house-servant in the patriarchal big house,
\par one found the best of both races in close contact and sympathy, while
\par at the same time the squalor and dull round of toil among the
\par field-hands was removed from the sight and hearing of the family.  One
\par can easily see how a person who saw slavery thus from his father's
\par parlors, and sees freedom on the streets of a great city, fails to
\par grasp or comprehend the whole of the new picture.  On the other hand,
\par the settled belief of the mass of the Negroes that the Southern white
\par people do not have the black man's best interests at heart has been
\par intensified in later years by this continual daily contact of the
\par better class of blacks with the worst representatives of the white race.
\par 
\par Coming now to the economic relations of the races, we are on ground
\par made familiar by study, much discussion, and no little philanthropic
\par effort.  And yet with all this there are many essential elements in the
\par cooperation of Negroes and whites for work and wealth that are too
\par readily overlooked or not thoroughly understood.  The average American
\par can easily conceive of a rich land awaiting development and filled with
\par black laborers.  To him the Southern problem is simply that of making
\par efficient workingmen out of this material, by giving them the requisite
\par technical skill and the help of invested capital.  The problem,
\par however, is by no means as simple as this, from the obvious fact that
\par these workingmen have been trained for centuries as slaves.  They
\par exhibit, therefore, all the advantages and defects of such training;
\par they are willing and good-natured, but not self-reliant, provident, or
\par careful.  If now the economic development of the South is to be pushed
\par to the verge of exploitation, as seems probable, then we have a mass of
\par workingmen thrown into relentless competition with the workingmen of
\par the world, but handicapped by a training the very opposite to that of
\par the modern self-reliant democratic laborer.  What the black laborer
\par needs is careful personal guidance, group leadership of men with hearts
\par in their bosoms, to train them to foresight, carefulness, and honesty.
\par Nor does it require any fine-spun theories of racial differences to
\par prove the necessity of such group training after the brains of the race
\par have been knocked out by two hundred and fifty years of assiduous
\par education in submission, carelessness, and stealing.  After
\par Emancipation, it was the plain duty of some one to assume this group
\par leadership and training of the Negro laborer.  I will not stop here to
\par inquire whose duty it was--whether that of the white ex-master who had
\par profited by unpaid toil, or the Northern philanthropist whose
\par persistence brought on the crisis, or the National Government whose
\par edict freed the bondmen; I will not stop to ask whose duty it was, but
\par I insist it was the duty of some one to see that these workingmen were
\par not left alone and unguided, without capital, without land, without
\par skill, without economic organization, without even the bald protection
\par of law, order, and decency,--left in a great land, not to settle down
\par to slow and careful internal development, but destined to be thrown
\par almost immediately into relentless and sharp competition with the best
\par of modern workingmen under an economic system where every participant
\par is fighting for himself, and too often utterly regardless of the rights
\par or welfare of his neighbor.
\par 
\par For we must never forget that the economic system of the South to-day
\par which has succeeded the old regime is not the same system as that of
\par the old industrial North, of England, or of France, with their
\par trade-unions, their restrictive laws, their written and unwritten
\par commercial customs, and their long experience.  It is, rather, a copy
\par of that England of the early nineteenth century, before the factory
\par acts,--the England that wrung pity from thinkers and fired the wrath of
\par Carlyle.  The rod of empire that passed from the hands of Southern
\par gentlemen in 1865, partly by force, partly by their own petulance, has
\par never returned to them.  Rather it has passed to those men who have
\par come to take charge of the industrial exploitation of the New
\par South,--the sons of poor whites fired with a new thirst for wealth and
\par power, thrifty and avaricious Yankees, and unscrupulous immigrants.
\par Into the hands of these men the Southern laborers, white and black,
\par have fallen; and this to their sorrow.  For the laborers as such, there
\par is in these new captains of industry neither love nor hate, neither
\par sympathy nor romance; it is a cold question of dollars and dividends.
\par Under such a system all labor is bound to suffer.  Even the white
\par laborers are not yet intelligent, thrifty, and well trained enough to
\par maintain themselves against the powerful inroads of organized capital.
\par The results among them, even, are long hours of toil, low wages, child
\par labor, and lack of protection against usury and cheating.  But among
\par the black laborers all this is aggravated, first, by a race prejudice
\par which varies from a doubt and distrust among the best element of whites
\par to a frenzied hatred among the worst; and, secondly, it is aggravated,
\par as I have said before, by the wretched economic heritage of the
\par freedmen from slavery.  With this training it is difficult for the
\par freedman to learn to grasp the opportunities already opened to him, and
\par the new opportunities are seldom given him, but go by favor to the
\par whites.
\par 
\par Left by the best elements of the South with little protection or
\par oversight, he has been made in law and custom the victim of the worst
\par and most unscrupulous men in each community.  The crop-lien system
\par which is depopulating the fields of the South is not simply the result
\par of shiftlessness on the part of Negroes, but is also the result of
\par cunningly devised laws as to mortgages, liens, and misdemeanors, which
\par can be made by conscienceless men to entrap and snare the unwary until
\par escape is impossible, further toil a farce, and protest a crime.  I
\par have seen, in the Black Belt of Georgia, an ignorant, honest Negro buy
\par and pay for a farm in installments three separate times, and then in
\par the face of law and decency the enterprising American who sold it to
\par him pocketed the money and deed and left the black man landless, to
\par labor on his own land at thirty cents a day.  I have seen a black
\par farmer fall in debt to a white storekeeper, and that storekeeper go to
\par his farm and strip it of every single marketable article,--mules,
\par ploughs, stored crops, tools, furniture, bedding, clocks,
\par looking-glass,--and all this without a sheriff or officer, in the face
\par of the law for homestead exemptions, and without rendering to a single
\par responsible person any account or reckoning.  And such proceedings can
\par happen, and will happen, in any community where a class of ignorant
\par toilers are placed by custom and race-prejudice beyond the pale of
\par sympathy and race-brotherhood.  So long as the best elements of a
\par community do not feel in duty bound to protect and train and care for
\par the weaker members of their group, they leave them to be preyed upon by
\par these swindlers and rascals.
\par 
\par This unfortunate economic situation does not mean the hindrance of all
\par advance in the black South, or the absence of a class of black
\par landlords and mechanics who, in spite of disadvantages, are
\par accumulating property and making good citizens.  But it does mean that
\par this class is not nearly so large as a fairer economic system might
\par easily make it, that those who survive in the competition are
\par handicapped so as to accomplish much less than they deserve to, and
\par that, above all, the personnel of the successful class is left to
\par chance and accident, and not to any intelligent culling or reasonable
\par methods of selection.  As a remedy for this, there is but one possible
\par procedure.  We must accept some of the race prejudice in the South as a
\par fact,--deplorable in its intensity, unfortunate in results, and
\par dangerous for the future, but nevertheless a hard fact which only time
\par can efface.  We cannot hope, then, in this generation, or for several
\par generations, that the mass of the whites can be brought to assume that
\par close sympathetic and self-sacrificing leadership of the blacks which
\par their present situation so eloquently demands.  Such leadership, such
\par social teaching and example, must come from the blacks themselves.  For
\par some time men doubted as to whether the Negro could develop such
\par leaders; but to-day no one seriously disputes the capability of
\par individual Negroes to assimilate the culture and common sense of modern
\par civilization, and to pass it on, to some extent at least, to their
\par fellows.  If this is true, then here is the path out of the economic
\par situation, and here is the imperative demand for trained Negro leaders
\par of character and intelligence,--men of skill, men of light and leading,
\par college-bred men, black captains of industry, and missionaries of
\par culture; men who thoroughly comprehend and know modern civilization,
\par and can take hold of Negro communities and raise and train them by
\par force of precept and example, deep sympathy, and the inspiration of
\par common blood and ideals.  But if such men are to be effective they must
\par have some power,--they must be backed by the best public opinion of
\par these communities, and able to wield for their objects and aims such
\par weapons as the experience of the world has taught are indispensable to
\par human progress.
\par 
\par Of such weapons the greatest, perhaps, in the modern world is the power
\par of the ballot; and this brings me to a consideration of the third form
\par of contact between whites and blacks in the South,--political activity.
\par 
\par In the attitude of the American mind toward Negro suffrage can be
\par traced with unusual accuracy the prevalent conceptions of government.
\par In the fifties we were near enough the echoes of the French Revolution
\par to believe pretty thoroughly in universal suffrage.  We argued, as we
\par thought then rather logically, that no social class was so good, so
\par true, and so disinterested as to be trusted wholly with the political
\par destiny of its neighbors; that in every state the best arbiters of
\par their own welfare are the persons directly affected; consequently that
\par it is only by arming every hand with a ballot,--with the right to have
\par a voice in the policy of the state,--that the greatest good to the
\par greatest number could be attained.  To be sure, there were objections
\par to these arguments, but we thought we had answered them tersely and
\par convincingly; if some one complained of the ignorance of voters, we
\par answered, "Educate them."  If another complained of their venality, we
\par replied, "Disfranchise them or put them in jail."  And, finally, to the
\par men who feared demagogues and the natural perversity of some human
\par beings we insisted that time and bitter experience would teach the most
\par hardheaded.  It was at this time that the question of Negro suffrage in
\par the South was raised.  Here was a defenceless people suddenly made
\par free.  How were they to be protected from those who did not believe in
\par their freedom and were determined to thwart it?  Not by force, said the
\par North; not by government guardianship, said the South; then by the
\par ballot, the sole and legitimate defence of a free people, said the
\par Common Sense of the Nation.  No one thought, at the time, that the
\par ex-slaves could use the ballot intelligently or very effectively; but
\par they did think that the possession of so great power by a great class
\par in the nation would compel their fellows to educate this class to its
\par intelligent use.
\par 
\par Meantime, new thoughts came to the nation: the inevitable period of
\par moral retrogression and political trickery that ever follows in the
\par wake of war overtook us.  So flagrant became the political scandals
\par that reputable men began to leave politics alone, and politics
\par consequently became disreputable.  Men began to pride themselves on
\par having nothing to do with their own government, and to agree tacitly
\par with those who regarded public office as a private perquisite.  In this
\par state of mind it became easy to wink at the suppression of the Negro
\par vote in the South, and to advise self-respecting Negroes to leave
\par politics entirely alone.  The decent and reputable citizens of the
\par North who neglected their own civic duties grew hilarious over the
\par exaggerated importance with which the Negro regarded the franchise.
\par Thus it easily happened that more and more the better class of Negroes
\par followed the advice from abroad and the pressure from home, and took no
\par further interest in politics, leaving to the careless and the venal of
\par their race the exercise of their rights as voters.  The black vote that
\par still remained was not trained and educated, but further debauched by
\par open and unblushing bribery, or force and fraud; until the Negro voter
\par was thoroughly inoculated with the idea that politics was a method of
\par private gain by disreputable means.
\par 
\par And finally, now, to-day, when we are awakening to the fact that the
\par perpetuity of republican institutions on this continent depends on the
\par purification of the ballot, the civic training of voters, and the
\par raising of voting to the plane of a solemn duty which a patriotic
\par citizen neglects to his peril and to the peril of his children's
\par children,--in this day, when we are striving for a renaissance of civic
\par virtue, what are we going to say to the black voter of the South?  Are
\par we going to tell him still that politics is a disreputable and useless
\par form of human activity?  Are we going to induce the best class of
\par Negroes to take less and less interest in government, and to give up
\par their right to take such an interest, without a protest?  I am not
\par saying a word against all legitimate efforts to purge the ballot of
\par ignorance, pauperism, and crime.  But few have pretended that the
\par present movement for disfranchisement in the South is for such a
\par purpose; it has been plainly and frankly declared in nearly every case
\par that the object of the disfranchising laws is the elimination of the
\par black man from politics.
\par 
\par Now, is this a minor matter which has no influence on the main question
\par of the industrial and intellectual development of the Negro?  Can we
\par establish a mass of black laborers and artisans and landholders in the
\par South who, by law and public opinion, have absolutely no voice in
\par shaping the laws under which they live and work?  Can the modern
\par organization of industry, assuming as it does free democratic
\par government and the power and ability of the laboring classes to compel
\par respect for their welfare,--can this system be carried out in the South
\par when half its laboring force is voiceless in the public councils and
\par powerless in its own defence?  To-day the black man of the South has
\par almost nothing to say as to how much he shall be taxed, or how those
\par taxes shall be expended; as to who shall execute the laws, and how they
\par shall do it; as to who shall make the laws, and how they shall be made.
\par It is pitiable that frantic efforts must be made at critical times to
\par get law-makers in some States even to listen to the respectful
\par presentation of the black man's side of a current controversy.  Daily
\par the Negro is coming more and more to look upon law and justice, not as
\par protecting safeguards, but as sources of humiliation and oppression.
\par The laws are made by men who have little interest in him; they are
\par executed by men who have absolutely no motive for treating the black
\par people with courtesy or consideration; and, finally, the accused
\par law-breaker is tried, not by his peers, but too often by men who would
\par rather punish ten innocent Negroes than let one guilty one escape.
\par 
\par I should be the last one to deny the patent weaknesses and shortcomings
\par of the Negro people; I should be the last to withhold sympathy from the
\par white South in its efforts to solve its intricate social problems.  I
\par freely acknowledged that it is possible, and sometimes best, that a
\par partially undeveloped people should be ruled by the best of their
\par stronger and better neighbors for their own good, until such time as
\par they can start and fight the world's battles alone.  I have already
\par pointed out how sorely in need of such economic and spiritual guidance
\par the emancipated Negro was, and I am quite willing to admit that if the
\par representatives of the best white Southern public opinion were the
\par ruling and guiding powers in the South to-day the conditions indicated
\par would be fairly well fulfilled.  But the point I have insisted upon and
\par now emphasize again, is that the best opinion of the South to-day is
\par not the ruling opinion.  That to leave the Negro helpless and without a
\par ballot to-day is to leave him not to the guidance of the best, but
\par rather to the exploitation and debauchment of the worst; that this is
\par no truer of the South than of the North,--of the North than of Europe:
\par in any land, in any country under modern free competition, to lay any
\par class of weak and despised people, be they white, black, or blue, at
\par the political mercy of their stronger, richer, and more resourceful
\par fellows, is a temptation which human nature seldom has withstood and
\par seldom will withstand.
\par 
\par Moreover, the political status of the Negro in the South is closely
\par connected with the question of Negro crime.  There can be no doubt that
\par crime among Negroes has sensibly increased in the last thirty years,
\par and that there has appeared in the slums of great cities a distinct
\par criminal class among the blacks.  In explaining this unfortunate
\par development, we must note two things: (1) that the inevitable result of
\par Emancipation was to increase crime and criminals, and (2) that the
\par police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves.
\par As to the first point, we must not forget that under a strict slave
\par system there can scarcely be such a thing as crime.  But when these
\par variously constituted human particles are suddenly thrown broadcast on
\par the sea of life, some swim, some sink, and some hang suspended, to be
\par forced up or down by the chance currents of a busy hurrying world.  So
\par great an economic and social revolution as swept the South in '63 meant
\par a weeding out among the Negroes of the incompetents and vicious, the
\par beginning of a differentiation of social grades.  Now a rising group of
\par people are not lifted bodily from the ground like an inert solid mass,
\par but rather stretch upward like a living plant with its roots still
\par clinging in the mould.  The appearance, therefore, of the Negro
\par criminal was a phenomenon to be awaited; and while it causes anxiety,
\par it should not occasion surprise.
\par 
\par Here again the hope for the future depended peculiarly on careful and
\par delicate dealing with these criminals.  Their offences at first were
\par those of laziness, carelessness, and impulse, rather than of malignity
\par or ungoverned viciousness.  Such misdemeanors needed discriminating
\par treatment, firm but reformatory, with no hint of injustice, and full
\par proof of guilt.  For such dealing with criminals, white or black, the
\par South had no machinery, no adequate jails or reformatories; its police
\par system was arranged to deal with blacks alone, and tacitly assumed that
\par every white man was ipso facto a member of that police.  Thus grew up a
\par double system of justice, which erred on the white side by undue
\par leniency and the practical immunity of red-handed criminals, and erred
\par on the black side by undue severity, injustice, and lack of
\par discrimination.  For, as I have said, the police system of the South
\par was originally designed to keep track of all Negroes, not simply of
\par criminals; and when the Negroes were freed and the whole South was
\par convinced of the impossibility of free Negro labor, the first and
\par almost universal device was to use the courts as a means of reenslaving
\par the blacks.  It was not then a question of crime, but rather one of
\par color, that settled a man's conviction on almost any charge.  Thus
\par Negroes came to look upon courts as instruments of injustice and
\par oppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.
\par 
\par When, now, the real Negro criminal appeared, and instead of petty
\par stealing and vagrancy we began to have highway robbery, burglary,
\par murder, and rape, there was a curious effect on both sides the
\par color-line: the Negroes refused to believe the evidence of white
\par witnesses or the fairness of white juries, so that the greatest
\par deterrent to crime, the public opinion of one's own social caste, was
\par lost, and the criminal was looked upon as crucified rather than hanged.
\par On the other hand, the whites, used to being careless as to the guilt
\par or innocence of accused Negroes, were swept in moments of passion
\par beyond law, reason, and decency.  Such a situation is bound to increase
\par crime, and has increased it.  To natural viciousness and vagrancy are
\par being daily added motives of revolt and revenge which stir up all the
\par latent savagery of both races and make peaceful attention to economic
\par development often impossible.
\par 
\par But the chief problem in any community cursed with crime is not the
\par punishment of the criminals, but the preventing of the young from being
\par trained to crime.  And here again the peculiar conditions of the South
\par have prevented proper precautions.  I have seen twelve-year-old boys
\par working in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front
\par of the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this
\par indiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the
\par chain-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauchery.  The struggle for
\par reformatories, which has gone on in Virginia, Georgia, and other
\par States, is the one encouraging sign of the awakening of some
\par communities to the suicidal results of this policy.
\par 
\par It is the public schools, however, which can be made, outside the
\par homes, the greatest means of training decent self-respecting citizens.
\par We have been so hotly engaged recently in discussing trade-schools and
\par the higher education that the pitiable plight of the public-school
\par system in the South has almost dropped from view.  Of every five
\par dollars spent for public education in the State of Georgia, the white
\par schools get four dollars and the Negro one dollar; and even then the
\par white public-school system, save in the cities, is bad and cries for
\par reform.  If this is true of the whites, what of the blacks?  I am
\par becoming more and more convinced, as I look upon the system of
\par common-school training in the South, that the national government must
\par soon step in and aid popular education in some way.  To-day it has been
\par only by the most strenuous efforts on the part of the thinking men of
\par the South that the Negro's share of the school fund has not been cut
\par down to a pittance in some half-dozen States; and that movement not
\par only is not dead, but in many communities is gaining strength.  What in
\par the name of reason does this nation expect of a people, poorly trained
\par and hard pressed in severe economic competition, without political
\par rights, and with ludicrously inadequate common-school facilities?  What
\par can it expect but crime and listlessness, offset here and there by the
\par dogged struggles of the fortunate and more determined who are
\par themselves buoyed by the hope that in due time the country will come to
\par its senses?
\par 
\par I have thus far sought to make clear the physical, economic, and
\par political relations of the Negroes and whites in the South, as I have
\par conceived them, including, for the reasons set forth, crime and
\par education.  But after all that has been said on these more tangible
\par matters of human contact, there still remains a part essential to a
\par proper description of the South which it is difficult to describe or
\par fix in terms easily understood by strangers.  It is, in fine, the
\par atmosphere of the land, the thought and feeling, the thousand and one
\par little actions which go to make up life.  In any community or nation it
\par is these little things which are most elusive to the grasp and yet most
\par essential to any clear conception of the group life taken as a whole.
\par What is thus true of all communities is peculiarly true of the South,
\par where, outside of written history and outside of printed law, there has
\par been going on for a generation as deep a storm and stress of human
\par souls, as intense a ferment of feeling, as intricate a writhing of
\par spirit, as ever a people experienced.  Within and without the sombre
\par veil of color vast social forces have been at work,--efforts for human
\par betterment, movements toward disintegration and despair, tragedies and
\par comedies in social and economic life, and a swaying and lifting and
\par sinking of human hearts which have made this land a land of mingled
\par sorrow and joy, of change and excitement and unrest.
\par 
\par The centre of this spiritual turmoil has ever been the millions of
\par black freedmen and their sons, whose destiny is so fatefully bound up
\par with that of the nation.  And yet the casual observer visiting the
\par South sees at first little of this.  He notes the growing frequency of
\par dark faces as he rides along,--but otherwise the days slip lazily on,
\par the sun shines, and this little world seems as happy and contented as
\par other worlds he has visited.  Indeed, on the question of questions--the
\par Negro problem--he hears so little that there almost seems to be a
\par conspiracy of silence; the morning papers seldom mention it, and then
\par usually in a far-fetched academic way, and indeed almost every one
\par seems to forget and ignore the darker half of the land, until the
\par astonished visitor is inclined to ask if after all there IS any problem
\par here.  But if he lingers long enough there comes the awakening: perhaps
\par in a sudden whirl of passion which leaves him gasping at its bitter
\par intensity; more likely in a gradually dawning sense of things he had
\par not at first noticed.  Slowly but surely his eyes begin to catch the
\par shadows of the color-line: here he meets crowds of Negroes and whites;
\par then he is suddenly aware that he cannot discover a single dark face;
\par or again at the close of a day's wandering he may find himself in some
\par strange assembly, where all faces are tinged brown or black, and where
\par he has the vague, uncomfortable feeling of the stranger.  He realizes
\par at last that silently, resistlessly, the world about flows by him in
\par two great streams: they ripple on in the same sunshine, they approach
\par and mingle their waters in seeming carelessness,--then they divide and
\par flow wide apart.  It is done quietly; no mistakes are made, or if one
\par occurs, the swift arm of the law and of public opinion swings down for
\par a moment, as when the other day a black man and a white woman were
\par arrested for talking together on Whitehall Street in Atlanta.
\par 
\par Now if one notices carefully one will see that between these two
\par worlds, despite much physical contact and daily intermingling, there is
\par almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where
\par the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and
\par sympathy with the thoughts and feelings of the other.  Before and
\par directly after the war, when all the best of the Negroes were domestic
\par servants in the best of the white families, there were bonds of
\par intimacy, affection, and sometimes blood relationship, between the
\par races.  They lived in the same home, shared in the family life, often
\par attended the same church, and talked and conversed with each other.
\par But the increasing civilization of the Negro since then has naturally
\par meant the development of higher classes: there are increasing numbers
\par of ministers, teachers, physicians, merchants, mechanics, and
\par independent farmers, who by nature and training are the aristocracy and
\par leaders of the blacks.  Between them, however, and the best element of
\par the whites, there is little or no intellectual commerce.  They go to
\par separate churches, they live in separate sections, they are strictly
\par separated in all public gatherings, they travel separately, and they
\par are beginning to read different papers and books.  To most libraries,
\par lectures, concerts, and museums, Negroes are either not admitted at
\par all, or on terms peculiarly galling to the pride of the very classes
\par who might otherwise be attracted.  The daily paper chronicles the
\par doings of the black world from afar with no great regard for accuracy;
\par and so on, throughout the category of means for intellectual
\par communication,--schools, conferences, efforts for social betterment,
\par and the like,--it is usually true that the very representatives of the
\par two races, who for mutual benefit and the welfare of the land ought to
\par be in complete understanding and sympathy, are so far strangers that
\par one side thinks all whites are narrow and prejudiced, and the other
\par thinks educated Negroes dangerous and insolent.  Moreover, in a land
\par where the tyranny of public opinion and the intolerance of criticism is
\par for obvious historical reasons so strong as in the South, such a
\par situation is extremely difficult to correct.  The white man, as well as
\par the Negro, is bound and barred by the color-line, and many a scheme of
\par friendliness and philanthropy, of broad-minded sympathy and generous
\par fellowship between the two has dropped still-born because some busybody
\par has forced the color-question to the front and brought the tremendous
\par force of unwritten law against the innovators.
\par 
\par It is hardly necessary for me to add very much in regard to the social
\par contact between the races.  Nothing has come to replace that finer
\par sympathy and love between some masters and house servants which the
\par radical and more uncompromising drawing of the color-line in recent
\par years has caused almost completely to disappear.  In a world where it
\par means so much to take a man by the hand and sit beside him, to look
\par frankly into his eyes and feel his heart beating with red blood; in a
\par world where a social cigar or a cup of tea together means more than
\par legislative halls and magazine articles and speeches,--one can imagine
\par the consequences of the almost utter absence of such social amenities
\par between estranged races, whose separation extends even to parks and
\par streetcars.
\par 
\par Here there can be none of that social going down to the people,--the
\par opening of heart and hand of the best to the worst, in generous
\par acknowledgment of a common humanity and a common destiny.  On the other
\par hand, in matters of simple almsgiving, where there can be no question
\par of social contact, and in the succor of the aged and sick, the South,
\par as if stirred by a feeling of its unfortunate limitations, is generous
\par to a fault.  The black beggar is never turned away without a good deal
\par more than a crust, and a call for help for the unfortunate meets quick
\par response.  I remember, one cold winter, in Atlanta, when I refrained
\par from contributing to a public relief fund lest Negroes should be
\par discriminated against, I afterward inquired of a friend: "Were any
\par black people receiving aid?"  "Why," said he, "they were all black."
\par 
\par And yet this does not touch the kernel of the problem.  Human
\par advancement is not a mere question of almsgiving, but rather of
\par sympathy and cooperation among classes who would scorn charity.  And
\par here is a land where, in the higher walks of life, in all the higher
\par striving for the good and noble and true, the color-line comes to
\par separate natural friends and coworkers; while at the bottom of the
\par social group, in the saloon, the gambling-hell, and the brothel, that
\par same line wavers and disappears.
\par 
\par I have sought to paint an average picture of real relations between the
\par sons of master and man in the South.  I have not glossed over matters
\par for policy's sake, for I fear we have already gone too far in that sort
\par of thing.  On the other hand, I have sincerely sought to let no unfair
\par exaggerations creep in.  I do not doubt that in some Southern
\par communities conditions are better than those I have indicated; while I
\par am no less certain that in other communities they are far worse.
\par 
\par Nor does the paradox and danger of this situation fail to interest and
\par perplex the best conscience of the South.  Deeply religious and
\par intensely democratic as are the mass of the whites, they feel acutely
\par the false position in which the Negro problems place them.  Such an
\par essentially honest-hearted and generous people cannot cite the
\par caste-levelling precepts of Christianity, or believe in equality of
\par opportunity for all men, without coming to feel more and more with each
\par generation that the present drawing of the color-line is a flat
\par contradiction to their beliefs and professions.  But just as often as
\par they come to this point, the present social condition of the Negro
\par stands as a menace and a portent before even the most open-minded: if
\par there were nothing to charge against the Negro but his blackness or
\par other physical peculiarities, they argue, the problem would be
\par comparatively simple; but what can we say to his ignorance,
\par shiftlessness, poverty, and crime?  can a self-respecting group hold
\par anything but the least possible fellowship with such persons and
\par survive? and shall we let a mawkish sentiment sweep away the culture of
\par our fathers or the hope of our children?  The argument so put is of
\par great strength, but it is not a whit stronger than the argument of
\par thinking Negroes: granted, they reply, that the condition of our masses
\par is bad; there is certainly on the one hand adequate historical cause
\par for this, and unmistakable evidence that no small number have, in spite
\par of tremendous disadvantages, risen to the level of American
\par civilization.  And when, by proscription and prejudice, these same
\par Negroes are classed with and treated like the lowest of their people,
\par simply because they are Negroes, such a policy not only discourages
\par thrift and intelligence among black men, but puts a direct premium on
\par the very things you complain of,--inefficiency and crime.  Draw lines
\par of crime, of incompetency, of vice, as tightly and uncompromisingly as
\par you will, for these things must be proscribed; but a color-line not
\par only does not accomplish this purpose, but thwarts it.
\par 
\par In the face of two such arguments, the future of the South depends on
\par the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and
\par appreciate and sympathize with each other's position,--for the Negro to
\par realize more deeply than he does at present the need of uplifting the
\par masses of his people, for the white people to realize more vividly than
\par they have yet done the deadening and disastrous effect of a
\par color-prejudice that classes Phillis Wheatley and Sam Hose in the same
\par despised class.
\par 
\par It is not enough for the Negroes to declare that color-prejudice is the
\par sole cause of their social condition, nor for the white South to reply
\par that their social condition is the main cause of prejudice.  They both
\par act as reciprocal cause and effect, and a change in neither alone will
\par bring the desired effect.  Both must change, or neither can improve to
\par any great extent.  The Negro cannot stand the present reactionary
\par tendencies and unreasoning drawing of the color-line indefinitely
\par without discouragement and retrogression.  And the condition of the
\par Negro is ever the excuse for further discrimination.  Only by a union
\par of intelligence and sympathy across the color-line in this critical
\par period of the Republic shall justice and right triumph,
\par 
\par   "That mind and soul according well,
\par   May make one music as before,
\par             But vaster."

\par 
\par 
\par It was out in the country, far from home, far from my foster home, on a
\par dark Sunday night.  The road wandered from our rambling log-house up
\par the stony bed of a creek, past wheat and corn, until we could hear
\par dimly across the fields a rhythmic cadence of song,--soft, thrilling,
\par powerful, that swelled and died sorrowfully in our ears.  I was a
\par country schoolteacher then, fresh from the East, and had never seen a
\par Southern Negro revival.  To be sure, we in Berkshire were not perhaps
\par as stiff and formal as they in Suffolk of olden time; yet we were very
\par quiet and subdued, and I know not what would have happened those clear
\par Sabbath mornings had some one punctuated the sermon with a wild scream,
\par or interrupted the long prayer with a loud Amen!  And so most striking
\par to me, as I approached the village and the little plain church perched
\par aloft, was the air of intense excitement that possessed that mass of
\par black folk.  A sort of suppressed terror hung in the air and seemed to
\par seize us,--a pythian madness, a demoniac possession, that lent terrible
\par reality to song and word.  The black and massive form of the preacher
\par swayed and quivered as the words crowded to his lips and flew at us in
\par singular eloquence.  The people moaned and fluttered, and then the
\par gaunt-cheeked brown woman beside me suddenly leaped straight into the
\par air and shrieked like a lost soul, while round about came wail and
\par groan and outcry, and a scene of human passion such as I had never
\par conceived before.
\par 
\par Those who have not thus witnessed the frenzy of a Negro revival in the
\par untouched backwoods of the South can but dimly realize the religious
\par feeling of the slave; as described, such scenes appear grotesque and
\par funny, but as seen they are awful.  Three things characterized this
\par religion of the slave,--the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy.  The
\par Preacher is the most unique personality developed by the Negro on
\par American soil.  A leader, a politician, an orator, a "boss," an
\par intriguer, an idealist,--all these he is, and ever, too, the centre of
\par a group of men, now twenty, now a thousand in number.  The combination
\par of a certain adroitness with deep-seated earnestness, of tact with
\par consummate ability, gave him his preeminence, and helps him maintain
\par it.  The type, of course, varies according to time and place, from the
\par West Indies in the sixteenth century to New England in the nineteenth,
\par and from the Mississippi bottoms to cities like New Orleans or New York.
\par 
\par The Music of Negro religion is that plaintive rhythmic melody, with its
\par touching minor cadences, which, despite caricature and defilement,
\par still remains the most original and beautiful expression of human life
\par and longing yet born on American soil.  Sprung from the African
\par forests, where its counterpart can still be heard, it was adapted,
\par changed, and intensified by the tragic soul-life of the slave, until,
\par under the stress of law and whip, it became the one true expression of
\par a people's sorrow, despair, and hope.
\par 
\par Finally the Frenzy of "Shouting," when the Spirit of the Lord passed
\par by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy, was
\par the last essential of Negro religion and the one more devoutly believed
\par in than all the rest.  It varied in expression from the silent rapt
\par countenance or the low murmur and moan to the mad abandon of physical
\par fervor,--the stamping, shrieking, and shouting, the rushing to and fro
\par and wild waving of arms, the weeping and laughing, the vision and the
\par trance.  All this is nothing new in the world, but old as religion, as
\par Delphi and Endor.  And so firm a hold did it have on the Negro, that
\par many generations firmly believed that without this visible
\par manifestation of the God there could be no true communion with the
\par Invisible.
\par 
\par These were the characteristics of Negro religious life as developed up
\par to the time of Emancipation.  Since under the peculiar circumstances of
\par the black man's environment they were the one expression of his higher
\par life, they are of deep interest to the student of his development, both
\par socially and psychologically.  Numerous are the attractive lines of
\par inquiry that here group themselves.  What did slavery mean to the
\par African savage?  What was his attitude toward the World and Life?  What
\par seemed to him good and evil,--God and Devil?  Whither went his longings
\par and strivings, and wherefore were his heart-burnings and
\par disappointments?  Answers to such questions can come only from a study
\par of Negro religion as a development, through its gradual changes from
\par the heathenism of the Gold Coast to the institutional Negro church of
\par Chicago.
\par 
\par Moreover, the religious growth of millions of men, even though they be
\par slaves, cannot be without potent influence upon their contemporaries.
\par The Methodists and Baptists of America owe much of their condition to
\par the silent but potent influence of their millions of Negro converts.
\par Especially is this noticeable in the South, where theology and
\par religious philosophy are on this account a long way behind the North,
\par and where the religion of the poor whites is a plain copy of Negro
\par thought and methods.  The mass of "gospel" hymns which has swept
\par through American churches and well-nigh ruined our sense of song
\par consists largely of debased imitations of Negro melodies made by ears
\par that caught the jingle but not the music, the body but not the soul, of
\par the Jubilee songs.  It is thus clear that the study of Negro religion
\par is not only a vital part of the history of the Negro in America, but no
\par uninteresting part of American history.
\par 
\par The Negro church of to-day is the social centre of Negro life in the
\par United States, and the most characteristic expression of African
\par character.  Take a typical church in a small Virginia town: it is the
\par "First Baptist"--a roomy brick edifice seating five hundred or more
\par persons, tastefully finished in Georgia pine, with a carpet, a small
\par organ, and stained-glass windows.  Underneath is a large assembly room
\par with benches.  This building is the central club-house of a community
\par of a thousand or more Negroes.  Various organizations meet here,--the
\par church proper, the Sunday-school, two or three insurance societies,
\par women's societies, secret societies, and mass meetings of various
\par kinds.  Entertainments, suppers, and lectures are held beside the five
\par or six regular weekly religious services.  Considerable sums of money
\par are collected and expended here, employment is found for the idle,
\par strangers are introduced, news is disseminated and charity distributed.
\par At the same time this social, intellectual, and economic centre is a
\par religious centre of great power.  Depravity, Sin, Redemption, Heaven,
\par Hell, and Damnation are preached twice a Sunday after the crops are
\par laid by; and few indeed of the community have the hardihood to
\par withstand conversion.  Back of this more formal religion, the Church
\par often stands as a real conserver of morals, a strengthener of family
\par life, and the final authority on what is Good and Right.
\par 
\par Thus one can see in the Negro church to-day, reproduced in microcosm,
\par all the great world from which the Negro is cut off by color-prejudice
\par and social condition.  In the great city churches the same tendency is
\par noticeable and in many respects emphasized.  A great church like the
\par Bethel of Philadelphia has over eleven hundred members, an edifice
\par seating fifteen hundred persons and valued at one hundred thousand
\par dollars, an annual budget of five thousand dollars, and a government
\par consisting of a pastor with several assisting local preachers, an
\par executive and legislative board, financial boards and tax collectors;
\par general church meetings for making laws; sub-divided groups led by
\par class leaders, a company of militia, and twenty-four auxiliary
\par societies.  The activity of a church like this is immense and
\par far-reaching, and the bishops who preside over these organizations
\par throughout the land are among the most powerful Negro rulers in the
\par world.
\par 
\par Such churches are really governments of men, and consequently a little
\par investigation reveals the curious fact that, in the South, at least,
\par practically every American Negro is a church member.  Some, to be sure,
\par are not regularly enrolled, and a few do not habitually attend
\par services; but, practically, a proscribed people must have a social
\par centre, and that centre for this people is the Negro church.  The
\par census of 1890 showed nearly twenty-four thousand Negro churches in the
\par country, with a total enrolled membership of over two and a half
\par millions, or ten actual church members to every twenty-eight persons,
\par and in some Southern States one in every two persons.  Besides these
\par there is the large number who, while not enrolled as members, attend
\par and take part in many of the activities of the church.  There is an
\par organized Negro church for every sixty black families in the nation,
\par and in some States for every forty families, owning, on an average, a
\par thousand dollars' worth of property each, or nearly twenty-six million
\par dollars in all.
\par 
\par Such, then, is the large development of the Negro church since
\par Emancipation.  The question now is, What have been the successive steps
\par of this social history and what are the present tendencies?  First, we
\par must realize that no such institution as the Negro church could rear
\par itself without definite historical foundations.  These foundations we
\par can find if we remember that the social history of the Negro did not
\par start in America.  He was brought from a definite social
\par environment,--the polygamous clan life under the headship of the chief
\par and the potent influence of the priest.  His religion was
\par nature-worship, with profound belief in invisible surrounding
\par influences, good and bad, and his worship was through incantation and
\par sacrifice.  The first rude change in this life was the slave ship and
\par the West Indian sugar-fields.  The plantation organization replaced the
\par clan and tribe, and the white master replaced the chief with far
\par greater and more despotic powers.  Forced and long-continued toil
\par became the rule of life, the old ties of blood relationship and kinship
\par disappeared, and instead of the family appeared a new polygamy and
\par polyandry, which, in some cases, almost reached promiscuity.  It was a
\par terrific social revolution, and yet some traces were retained of the
\par former group life, and the chief remaining institution was the Priest
\par or Medicine-man.  He early appeared on the plantation and found his
\par function as the healer of the sick, the interpreter of the Unknown, the
\par comforter of the sorrowing, the supernatural avenger of wrong, and the
\par one who rudely but picturesquely expressed the longing, disappointment,
\par and resentment of a stolen and oppressed people.  Thus, as bard,
\par physician, judge, and priest, within the narrow limits allowed by the
\par slave system, rose the Negro preacher, and under him the first church
\par was not at first by any means Christian nor definitely organized;
\par rather it was an adaptation and mingling of heathen rites among the
\par members of each plantation, and roughly designated as Voodooism.
\par Association with the masters, missionary effort and motives of
\par expediency gave these rites an early veneer of Christianity, and after
\par the lapse of many generations the Negro church became Christian.
\par 
\par Two characteristic things must be noticed in regard to the church.
\par First, it became almost entirely Baptist and Methodist in faith;
\par secondly, as a social institution it antedated by many decades the
\par monogamic Negro home.  From the very circumstances of its beginning,
\par the church was confined to the plantation, and consisted primarily of a
\par series of disconnected units; although, later on, some freedom of
\par movement was allowed, still this geographical limitation was always
\par important and was one cause of the spread of the decentralized and
\par democratic Baptist faith among the slaves.  At the same time, the
\par visible rite of baptism appealed strongly to their mystic temperament.
\par To-day the Baptist Church is still largest in membership among Negroes,
\par and has a million and a half communicants.  Next in popularity came the
\par churches organized in connection with the white neighboring churches,
\par chiefly Baptist and Methodist, with a few Episcopalian and others.  The
\par Methodists still form the second greatest denomination, with nearly a
\par million members.  The faith of these two leading denominations was more
\par suited to the slave church from the prominence they gave to religious
\par feeling and fervor.  The Negro membership in other denominations has
\par always been small and relatively unimportant, although the
\par Episcopalians and Presbyterians are gaining among the more intelligent
\par classes to-day, and the Catholic Church is making headway in certain
\par sections.  After Emancipation, and still earlier in the North, the
\par Negro churches largely severed such affiliations as they had had with
\par the white churches, either by choice or by compulsion.  The Baptist
\par churches became independent, but the Methodists were compelled early to
\par unite for purposes of episcopal government.  This gave rise to the
\par great African Methodist Church, the greatest Negro organization in the
\par world, to the Zion Church and the Colored Methodist, and to the black
\par conferences and churches in this and other denominations.
\par 
\par The second fact noted, namely, that the Negro church antedates the
\par Negro home, leads to an explanation of much that is paradoxical in this
\par communistic institution and in the morals of its members.  But
\par especially it leads us to regard this institution as peculiarly the
\par expression of the inner ethical life of a people in a sense seldom true
\par elsewhere.  Let us turn, then, from the outer physical development of
\par the church to the more important inner ethical life of the people who
\par compose it.  The Negro has already been pointed out many times as a
\par religious animal,--a being of that deep emotional nature which turns
\par instinctively toward the supernatural.  Endowed with a rich tropical
\par imagination and a keen, delicate appreciation of Nature, the
\par transplanted African lived in a world animate with gods and devils,
\par elves and witches; full of strange influences,--of Good to be implored,
\par of Evil to be propitiated.  Slavery, then, was to him the dark triumph
\par of Evil over him.  All the hateful powers of the Under-world were
\par striving against him, and a spirit of revolt and revenge filled his
\par heart.  He called up all the resources of heathenism to aid,--exorcism
\par and witch-craft, the mysterious Obi worship with its barbarious rites,
\par spells, and blood-sacrifice even, now and then, of human victims.
\par Weird midnight orgies and mystic conjurations were invoked, the
\par witch-woman and the voodoo-priest became the centre of Negro group
\par life, and that vein of vague superstition which characterizes the
\par unlettered Negro even to-day was deepened and strengthened.
\par 
\par In spite, however, of such success as that of the fierce Maroons, the
\par Danish blacks, and others, the spirit of revolt gradually died away
\par under the untiring energy and superior strength of the slave masters.
\par By the middle of the eighteenth century the black slave had sunk, with
\par hushed murmurs, to his place at the bottom of a new economic system,
\par and was unconsciously ripe for a new philosophy of life.  Nothing
\par suited his condition then better than the doctrines of passive
\par submission embodied in the newly learned Christianity.  Slave masters
\par early realized this, and cheerfully aided religious propaganda within
\par certain bounds.  The long system of repression and degradation of the
\par Negro tended to emphasize the elements of his character which made him
\par a valuable chattel: courtesy became humility, moral strength
\par degenerated into submission, and the exquisite native appreciation of
\par the beautiful became an infinite capacity for dumb suffering.  The
\par Negro, losing the joy of this world, eagerly seized upon the offered
\par conceptions of the next; the avenging Spirit of the Lord enjoining
\par patience in this world, under sorrow and tribulation until the Great
\par Day when He should lead His dark children home,--this became his
\par comforting dream.  His preacher repeated the prophecy, and his bards
\par sang,--
\par 
\par   "Children, we all shall be free
\par   When the Lord shall appear!"
\par 
\par 
\par This deep religious fatalism, painted so beautifully in "Uncle Tom,"
\par came soon to breed, as all fatalistic faiths will, the sensualist side
\par by side with the martyr.  Under the lax moral life of the plantation,
\par where marriage was a farce, laziness a virtue, and property a theft, a
\par religion of resignation and submission degenerated easily, in less
\par strenuous minds, into a philosophy of indulgence and crime.  Many of
\par the worst characteristics of the Negro masses of to-day had their seed
\par in this period of the slave's ethical growth.  Here it was that the
\par Home was ruined under the very shadow of the Church, white and black;
\par here habits of shiftlessness took root, and sullen hopelessness
\par replaced hopeful strife.
\par 
\par With the beginning of the abolition movement and the gradual growth of
\par a class of free Negroes came a change.  We often neglect the influence
\par of the freedman before the war, because of the paucity of his numbers
\par and the small weight he had in the history of the nation.  But we must
\par not forget that his chief influence was internal,--was exerted on the
\par black world; and that there he was the ethical and social leader.
\par Huddled as he was in a few centres like Philadelphia, New York, and New
\par Orleans, the masses of the freedmen sank into poverty and listlessness;
\par but not all of them.  The free Negro leader early arose and his chief
\par characteristic was intense earnestness and deep feeling on the slavery
\par question.  Freedom became to him a real thing and not a dream.  His
\par religion became darker and more intense, and into his ethics crept a
\par note of revenge, into his songs a day of reckoning close at hand.  The
\par "Coming of the Lord" swept this side of Death, and came to be a thing
\par to be hoped for in this day.  Through fugitive slaves and irrepressible
\par discussion this desire for freedom seized the black millions still in
\par bondage, and became their one ideal of life.  The black bards caught
\par new notes, and sometimes even dared to sing,--
\par 
\par   "O Freedom, O Freedom, O Freedom over me!
\par   Before I'll be a slave
\par   I'll be buried in my grave,
\par   And go home to my Lord
\par   And be free."
\par 
\par 
\par For fifty years Negro religion thus transformed itself and identified
\par itself with the dream of Abolition, until that which was a radical fad
\par in the white North and an anarchistic plot in the white South had
\par become a religion to the black world.  Thus, when Emancipation finally
\par came, it seemed to the freedman a literal Coming of the Lord.  His
\par fervid imagination was stirred as never before, by the tramp of armies,
\par the blood and dust of battle, and the wail and whirl of social
\par upheaval.  He stood dumb and motionless before the whirlwind: what had
\par he to do with it?  Was it not the Lord's doing, and marvellous in his
\par eyes?  Joyed and bewildered with what came, he stood awaiting new
\par wonders till the inevitable Age of Reaction swept over the nation and
\par brought the crisis of to-day.
\par 
\par It is difficult to explain clearly the present critical stage of Negro
\par religion.  First, we must remember that living as the blacks do in
\par close contact with a great modern nation, and sharing, although
\par imperfectly, the soul-life of that nation, they must necessarily be
\par affected more or less directly by all the religious and ethical forces
\par that are to-day moving the United States.  These questions and
\par movements are, however, overshadowed and dwarfed by the (to them)
\par all-important question of their civil, political, and economic status.
\par They must perpetually discuss the "Negro Problem,"--must live, move,
\par and have their being in it, and interpret all else in its light or
\par darkness.  With this come, too, peculiar problems of their inner
\par life,--of the status of women, the maintenance of Home, the training of
\par children, the accumulation of wealth, and the prevention of crime.  All
\par this must mean a time of intense ethical ferment, of religious
\par heart-searching and intellectual unrest.  From the double life every
\par American Negro must live, as a Negro and as an American, as swept on by
\par the current of the nineteenth while yet struggling in the eddies of the
\par fifteenth century,--from this must arise a painful self-consciousness,
\par an almost morbid sense of personality and a moral hesitancy which is
\par fatal to self-confidence.  The worlds within and without the Veil of
\par Color are changing, and changing rapidly, but not at the same rate, not
\par in the same way; and this must produce a peculiar wrenching of the
\par soul, a peculiar sense of doubt and bewilderment.  Such a double life,
\par with double thoughts, double duties, and double social classes, must
\par give rise to double words and double ideals, and tempt the mind to
\par pretence or revolt, to hypocrisy or radicalism.
\par 
\par In some such doubtful words and phrases can one perhaps most clearly
\par picture the peculiar ethical paradox that faces the Negro of to-day and
\par is tingeing and changing his religious life.  Feeling that his rights
\par and his dearest ideals are being trampled upon, that the public
\par conscience is ever more deaf to his righteous appeal, and that all the
\par reactionary forces of prejudice, greed, and revenge are daily gaining
\par new strength and fresh allies, the Negro faces no enviable dilemma.
\par Conscious of his impotence, and pessimistic, he often becomes bitter
\par and vindictive; and his religion, instead of a worship, is a complaint
\par and a curse, a wail rather than a hope, a sneer rather than a faith.
\par On the other hand, another type of mind, shrewder and keener and more
\par tortuous too, sees in the very strength of the anti-Negro movement its
\par patent weaknesses, and with Jesuitic casuistry is deterred by no
\par ethical considerations in the endeavor to turn this weakness to the
\par black man's strength.  Thus we have two great and hardly reconcilable
\par streams of thought and ethical strivings; the danger of the one lies in
\par anarchy, that of the other in hypocrisy.  The one type of Negro stands
\par almost ready to curse God and die, and the other is too often found a
\par traitor to right and a coward before force; the one is wedded to ideals
\par remote, whimsical, perhaps impossible of realization; the other forgets
\par that life is more than meat and the body more than raiment.  But, after
\par all, is not this simply the writhing of the age translated into
\par black,--the triumph of the Lie which today, with its false culture,
\par faces the hideousness of the anarchist assassin?
\par 
\par To-day the two groups of Negroes, the one in the North, the other in
\par the South, represent these divergent ethical tendencies, the first
\par tending toward radicalism, the other toward hypocritical compromise.
\par It is no idle regret with which the white South mourns the loss of the
\par old-time Negro,--the frank, honest, simple old servant who stood for
\par the earlier religious age of submission and humility.  With all his
\par laziness and lack of many elements of true manhood, he was at least
\par open-hearted, faithful, and sincere.  To-day he is gone, but who is to
\par blame for his going?  Is it not those very persons who mourn for him?
\par Is it not the tendency, born of Reconstruction and Reaction, to found a
\par society on lawlessness and deception, to tamper with the moral fibre of
\par a naturally honest and straightforward people until the whites threaten
\par to become ungovernable tyrants and the blacks criminals and hypocrites?
\par Deception is the natural defence of the weak against the strong, and
\par the South used it for many years against its conquerors; to-day it must
\par be prepared to see its black proletariat turn that same two-edged
\par weapon against itself.  And how natural this is!  The death of Denmark
\par Vesey and Nat Turner proved long since to the Negro the present
\par hopelessness of physical defence.  Political defence is becoming less
\par and less available, and economic defence is still only partially
\par effective.  But there is a patent defence at hand,--the defence of
\par deception and flattery, of cajoling and lying.  It is the same defence
\par which peasants of the Middle Age used and which left its stamp on their
\par character for centuries.  To-day the young Negro of the South who would
\par succeed cannot be frank and outspoken, honest and self-assertive, but
\par rather he is daily tempted to be silent and wary, politic and sly; he
\par must flatter and be pleasant, endure petty insults with a smile, shut
\par his eyes to wrong; in too many cases he sees positive personal
\par advantage in deception and lying.  His real thoughts, his real
\par aspirations, must be guarded in whispers; he must not criticise, he
\par must not complain.  Patience, humility, and adroitness must, in these
\par growing black youth, replace impulse, manliness, and courage.  With
\par this sacrifice there is an economic opening, and perhaps peace and some
\par prosperity.  Without this there is riot, migration, or crime.  Nor is
\par this situation peculiar to the Southern United States, is it not rather
\par the only method by which undeveloped races have gained the right to
\par share modern culture?  The price of culture is a Lie.
\par 
\par On the other hand, in the North the tendency is to emphasize the
\par radicalism of the Negro.  Driven from his birthright in the South by a
\par situation at which every fibre of his more outspoken and assertive
\par nature revolts, he finds himself in a land where he can scarcely earn a
\par decent living amid the harsh competition and the color discrimination.
\par At the same time, through schools and periodicals, discussions and
\par lectures, he is intellectually quickened and awakened.  The soul, long
\par pent up and dwarfed, suddenly expands in new-found freedom.  What
\par wonder that every tendency is to excess,--radical complaint, radical
\par remedies, bitter denunciation or angry silence.  Some sink, some rise.
\par The criminal and the sensualist leave the church for the gambling-hell
\par and the brothel, and fill the slums of Chicago and Baltimore; the
\par better classes segregate themselves from the group-life of both white
\par and black, and form an aristocracy, cultured but pessimistic, whose
\par bitter criticism stings while it points out no way of escape.  They
\par despise the submission and subserviency of the Southern Negroes, but
\par offer no other means by which a poor and oppressed minority can exist
\par side by side with its masters.  Feeling deeply and keenly the
\par tendencies and opportunities of the age in which they live, their souls
\par are bitter at the fate which drops the Veil between; and the very fact
\par that this bitterness is natural and justifiable only serves to
\par intensify it and make it more maddening.
\par 
\par Between the two extreme types of ethical attitude which I have thus
\par sought to make clear wavers the mass of the millions of Negroes, North
\par and South; and their religious life and activity partake of this social
\par conflict within their ranks.  Their churches are differentiating,--now
\par into groups of cold, fashionable devotees, in no way distinguishable
\par from similar white groups save in color of skin; now into large social
\par and business institutions catering to the desire for information and
\par amusement of their members, warily avoiding unpleasant questions both
\par within and without the black world, and preaching in effect if not in
\par word: Dum vivimus, vivamus.
\par 
\par But back of this still broods silently the deep religious feeling of
\par the real Negro heart, the stirring, unguided might of powerful human
\par souls who have lost the guiding star of the past and seek in the great
\par night a new religious ideal.  Some day the Awakening will come, when
\par the pent-up vigor of ten million souls shall sweep irresistibly toward
\par the Goal, out of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, where all that
\par makes life worth living--Liberty, Justice, and Right--is marked "For
\par White People Only."

\par 
\par Of the Passing of the First-Born
\par 
\par   O sister, sister, thy first-begotten,
\par   The hands that cling and the feet that follow,
\par   The voice of the child's blood crying yet,
\par   WHO HATH REMEMBERED ME?  WHO HATH FORGOTTEN?
\par   Thou hast forgotten, O summer swallow,
\par   But the world shall end when I forget.
\par 
\par   SWINBURNE.
\par 
\par 
\par "Unto you a child is born," sang the bit of yellow paper that fluttered
\par into my room one brown October morning.  Then the fear of fatherhood
\par mingled wildly with the joy of creation; I wondered how it looked and
\par how it felt--what were its eyes, and how its hair curled and crumpled
\par itself.  And I thought in awe of her,--she who had slept with Death to
\par tear a man-child from underneath her heart, while I was unconsciously
\par wandering.  I fled to my wife and child, repeating the while to myself
\par half wonderingly, "Wife and child?  Wife and child?"--fled fast and
\par faster than boat and steam-car, and yet must ever impatiently await
\par them; away from the hard-voiced city, away from the flickering sea into
\par my own Berkshire Hills that sit all sadly guarding the gates of
\par Massachusetts.
\par 
\par Up the stairs I ran to the wan mother and whimpering babe, to the
\par sanctuary on whose altar a life at my bidding had offered itself to win
\par a life, and won.  What is this tiny formless thing, this newborn wail
\par from an unknown world,--all head and voice?  I handle it curiously, and
\par watch perplexed its winking, breathing, and sneezing.  I did not love
\par it then; it seemed a ludicrous thing to love; but her I loved, my
\par girl-mother, she whom now I saw unfolding like the glory of the
\par morning--the transfigured woman.  Through her I came to love the wee
\par thing, as it grew strong; as its little soul unfolded itself in twitter
\par and cry and half-formed word, and as its eyes caught the gleam and
\par flash of life.  How beautiful he was, with his olive-tinted flesh and
\par dark gold ringlets, his eyes of mingled blue and brown, his perfect
\par little limbs, and the soft voluptuous roll which the blood of Africa
\par had moulded into his features!  I held him in my arms, after we had
\par sped far away from our Southern home,--held him, and glanced at the hot
\par red soil of Georgia and the breathless city of a hundred hills, and
\par felt a vague unrest.  Why was his hair tinted with gold?  An evil omen
\par was golden hair in my life.  Why had not the brown of his eyes crushed
\par out and killed the blue?--for brown were his father's eyes, and his
\par father's father's.  And thus in the Land of the Color-line I saw, as it
\par fell across my baby, the shadow of the Veil.
\par 
\par Within the Veil was he born, said I; and there within shall he live,--a
\par Negro and a Negro's son.  Holding in that little head--ah,
\par bitterly!--he unbowed pride of a hunted race, clinging with that tiny
\par dimpled hand--ah, wearily!--to a hope not hopeless but unhopeful, and
\par seeing with those bright wondering eyes that peer into my soul a land
\par whose freedom is to us a mockery and whose liberty a lie.  I saw the
\par shadow of the Veil as it passed over my baby, I saw the cold city
\par towering above the blood-red land.  I held my face beside his little
\par cheek, showed him the star-children and the twinkling lights as they
\par began to flash, and stilled with an even-song the unvoiced terror of my
\par life.
\par 
\par So sturdy and masterful he grew, so filled with bubbling life, so
\par tremulous with the unspoken wisdom of a life but eighteen months
\par distant from the All-life,--we were not far from worshipping this
\par revelation of the divine, my wife and I. Her own life builded and
\par moulded itself upon the child; he tinged her every dream and idealized
\par her every effort.  No hands but hers must touch and garnish those
\par little limbs; no dress or frill must touch them that had not wearied
\par her fingers; no voice but hers could coax him off to Dreamland, and she
\par and he together spoke some soft and unknown tongue and in it held
\par communion.  I too mused above his little white bed; saw the strength of
\par my own arm stretched onward through the ages through the newer strength
\par of his; saw the dream of my black fathers stagger a step onward in the
\par wild phantasm of the world; heard in his baby voice the voice of the
\par Prophet that was to rise within the Veil.
\par 
\par And so we dreamed and loved and planned by fall and winter, and the
\par full flush of the long Southern spring, till the hot winds rolled from
\par the fetid Gulf, till the roses shivered and the still stern sun
\par quivered its awful light over the hills of Atlanta.  And then one night
\par the little feet pattered wearily to the wee white bed, and the tiny
\par hands trembled; and a warm flushed face tossed on the pillow, and we
\par knew baby was sick.  Ten days he lay there,--a swift week and three
\par endless days, wasting, wasting away.  Cheerily the mother nursed him
\par the first days, and laughed into the little eyes that smiled again.
\par Tenderly then she hovered round him, till the smile fled away and Fear
\par crouched beside the little bed.
\par 
\par Then the day ended not, and night was a dreamless terror, and joy and
\par sleep slipped away.  I hear now that Voice at midnight calling me from
\par dull and dreamless trance,--crying, "The Shadow of Death!  The Shadow
\par of Death!"  Out into the starlight I crept, to rouse the gray
\par physician,--the Shadow of Death, the Shadow of Death.  The hours
\par trembled on; the night listened; the ghastly dawn glided like a tired
\par thing across the lamplight.  Then we two alone looked upon the child as
\par he turned toward us with great eyes, and stretched his stringlike
\par hands,--the Shadow of Death!  And we spoke no word, and turned away.
\par 
\par He died at eventide, when the sun lay like a brooding sorrow above the
\par western hills, veiling its face; when the winds spoke not, and the
\par trees, the great green trees he loved, stood motionless.  I saw his
\par breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt
\par like a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in
\par its train.  The day changed not; the same tall trees peeped in at the
\par windows, the same green grass glinted in the setting sun.  Only in the
\par chamber of death writhed the world's most piteous thing--a childless
\par mother.
\par 
\par I shirk not.  I long for work.  I pant for a life full of striving.  I
\par am no coward, to shrink before the rugged rush of the storm, nor even
\par quail before the awful shadow of the Veil.  But hearken, O Death!  Is
\par not this my life hard enough,--is not that dull land that stretches its
\par sneering web about me cold enough,--is not all the world beyond these
\par four little walls pitiless enough, but that thou must needs enter
\par here,--thou, O Death?  About my head the thundering storm beat like a
\par heartless voice, and the crazy forest pulsed with the curses of the
\par weak; but what cared I, within my home beside my wife and baby boy?
\par Wast thou so jealous of one little coign of happiness that thou must
\par needs enter there,--thou, O Death?
\par 
\par A perfect life was his, all joy and love, with tears to make it
\par brighter,--sweet as a summer's day beside the Housatonic.  The world
\par loved him; the women kissed his curls, the men looked gravely into his
\par wonderful eyes, and the children hovered and fluttered about him.  I
\par can see him now, changing like the sky from sparkling laughter to
\par darkening frowns, and then to wondering thoughtfulness as he watched
\par the world.  He knew no color-line, poor dear--and the Veil, though it
\par shadowed him, had not yet darkened half his sun.  He loved the white
\par matron, he loved his black nurse; and in his little world walked souls
\par alone, uncolored and unclothed.  I--yea, all men--are larger and purer
\par by the infinite breadth of that one little life.  She who in simple
\par clearness of vision sees beyond the stars said when he had flown, "He
\par will be happy There; he ever loved beautiful things."  And I, far more
\par ignorant, and blind by the web of mine own weaving, sit alone winding
\par words and muttering, "If still he be, and he be There, and there be a
\par There, let him be happy, O Fate!"
\par 
\par Blithe was the morning of his burial, with bird and song and
\par sweet-smelling flowers.  The trees whispered to the grass, but the
\par children sat with hushed faces.  And yet it seemed a ghostly unreal
\par day,--the wraith of Life.  We seemed to rumble down an unknown street
\par behind a little white bundle of posies, with the shadow of a song in
\par our ears.  The busy city dinned about us; they did not say much, those
\par pale-faced hurrying men and women; they did not say much,--they only
\par glanced and said, "Niggers!"
\par 
\par We could not lay him in the ground there in Georgia, for the earth
\par there is strangely red; so we bore him away to the northward, with his
\par flowers and his little folded hands.  In vain, in vain!--for where, O
\par God!  beneath thy broad blue sky shall my dark baby rest in
\par peace,--where Reverence dwells, and Goodness, and a Freedom that is
\par free?
\par 
\par All that day and all that night there sat an awful gladness in my
\par heart,--nay, blame me not if I see the world thus darkly through the
\par Veil,--and my soul whispers ever to me saying, "Not dead, not dead, but
\par escaped; not bond, but free."  No bitter meanness now shall sicken his
\par baby heart till it die a living death, no taunt shall madden his happy
\par boyhood.  Fool that I was to think or wish that this little soul should
\par grow choked and deformed within the Veil!  I might have known that
\par yonder deep unworldly look that ever and anon floated past his eyes was
\par peering far beyond this narrow Now.  In the poise of his little
\par curl-crowned head did there not sit all that wild pride of being which
\par his father had hardly crushed in his own heart?  For what, forsooth,
\par shall a Negro want with pride amid the studied humiliations of fifty
\par million fellows?  Well sped, my boy, before the world had dubbed your
\par ambition insolence, had held your ideals unattainable, and taught you
\par to cringe and bow.  Better far this nameless void that stops my life
\par than a sea of sorrow for you.
\par 
\par Idle words; he might have borne his burden more bravely than we,--aye,
\par and found it lighter too, some day; for surely, surely this is not the
\par end.  Surely there shall yet dawn some mighty morning to lift the Veil
\par and set the prisoned free.  Not for me,--I shall die in my bonds,--but
\par for fresh young souls who have not known the night and waken to the
\par morning; a morning when men ask of the workman, not "Is he white?" but
\par "Can he work?"  When men ask artists, not "Are they black?" but "Do
\par they know?"  Some morning this may be, long, long years to come.  But
\par now there wails, on that dark shore within the Veil, the same deep
\par voice, THOU SHALT FOREGO!  And all have I foregone at that command, and
\par with small complaint,--all save that fair young form that lies so
\par coldly wed with death in the nest I had builded.
\par 
\par If one must have gone, why not I?  Why may I not rest me from this
\par restlessness and sleep from this wide waking?  Was not the world's
\par alembic, Time, in his young hands, and is not my time waning?  Are
\par there so many workers in the vineyard that the fair promise of this
\par little body could lightly be tossed away?  The wretched of my race that
\par line the alleys of the nation sit fatherless and unmothered; but Love
\par sat beside his cradle, and in his ear Wisdom waited to speak.  Perhaps
\par now he knows the All-love, and needs not to be wise.  Sleep, then,
\par child,--sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless
\par patter of little feet--above the Veil.

\par 
\par XII
\par 
\par Of Alexander Crummell
\par 
\par   Then from the Dawn it seemed there came, but faint
\par   As from beyond the limit of the world,
\par   Like the last echo born of a great cry,
\par   Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice
\par   Around a king returning from his wars.
\par 
\par   TENNYSON.
\par 
\par 
\par This is the story of a human heart,--the tale of a black boy who many
\par long years ago began to struggle with life that he might know the world
\par and know himself.  Three temptations he met on those dark dunes that
\par lay gray and dismal before the wonder-eyes of the child: the temptation
\par of Hate, that stood out against the red dawn; the temptation of
\par Despair, that darkened noonday; and the temptation of Doubt, that ever
\par steals along with twilight.  Above all, you must hear of the vales he
\par crossed,--the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of
\par Death.
\par 
\par I saw Alexander Crummell first at a Wilberforce commencement season,
\par amid its bustle and crush.  Tall, frail, and black he stood, with
\par simple dignity and an unmistakable air of good breeding.  I talked with
\par him apart, where the storming of the lusty young orators could not harm
\par us.  I spoke to him politely, then curiously, then eagerly, as I began
\par to feel the fineness of his character,--his calm courtesy, the
\par sweetness of his strength, and his fair blending of the hope and truth
\par of life.  Instinctively I bowed before this man, as one bows before the
\par prophets of the world.  Some seer he seemed, that came not from the
\par crimson Past or the gray To-come, but from the pulsing Now,--that
\par mocking world which seemed to me at once so light and dark, so splendid
\par and sordid.  Fourscore years had he wandered in this same world of
\par mine, within the Veil.
\par 
\par He was born with the Missouri Compromise and lay a-dying amid the
\par echoes of Manila and El Caney: stirring times for living, times dark to
\par look back upon, darker to look forward to. The black-faced lad that
\par paused over his mud and marbles seventy years ago saw puzzling vistas
\par as he looked down the world.  The slave-ship still groaned across the
\par Atlantic, faint cries burdened the Southern breeze, and the great black
\par father whispered mad tales of cruelty into those young ears.  From the
\par low doorway the mother silently watched her boy at play, and at
\par nightfall sought him eagerly lest the shadows bear him away to the land
\par of slaves.
\par 
\par So his young mind worked and winced and shaped curiously a vision of
\par Life; and in the midst of that vision ever stood one dark figure
\par alone,--ever with the hard, thick countenance of that bitter father,
\par and a form that fell in vast and shapeless folds.  Thus the temptation
\par of Hate grew and shadowed the growing child,--gliding stealthily into
\par his laughter, fading into his play, and seizing his dreams by day and
\par night with rough, rude turbulence.  So the black boy asked of sky and
\par sun and flower the never-answered Why? and loved, as he grew, neither
\par the world nor the world's rough ways.
\par 
\par Strange temptation for a child, you may think; and yet in this wide
\par land to-day a thousand thousand dark children brood before this same
\par temptation, and feel its cold and shuddering arms.  For them, perhaps,
\par some one will some day lift the Veil,--will come tenderly and cheerily
\par into those sad little lives and brush the brooding hate away, just as
\par Beriah Green strode in upon the life of Alexander Crummell.  And before
\par the bluff, kind-hearted man the shadow seemed less dark.  Beriah Green
\par had a school in Oneida County, New York, with a score of mischievous
\par boys.  "I'm going to bring a black boy here to educate," said Beriah
\par Green, as only a crank and an abolitionist would have dared to say.
\par "Oho!" laughed the boys.  "Ye-es," said his wife; and Alexander came.
\par Once before, the black boy had sought a school, had travelled, cold and
\par hungry, four hundred miles up into free New Hampshire, to Canaan.  But
\par the godly farmers hitched ninety yoke of oxen to the abolition
\par schoolhouse and dragged it into the middle of the swamp.  The black boy
\par trudged away.
\par 
\par The nineteenth was the first century of human sympathy,--the age when
\par half wonderingly we began to descry in others that transfigured spark
\par of divinity which we call Myself; when clodhoppers and peasants, and
\par tramps and thieves, and millionaires and--sometimes--Negroes, became
\par throbbing souls whose warm pulsing life touched us so nearly that we
\par half gasped with surprise, crying, "Thou too!  Hast Thou seen Sorrow
\par and the dull waters of Hopelessness?  Hast Thou known Life?"  And then
\par all helplessly we peered into those Other-worlds, and wailed, "O World
\par of Worlds, how shall man make you one?"
\par 
\par So in that little Oneida school there came to those schoolboys a
\par revelation of thought and longing beneath one black skin, of which they
\par had not dreamed before.  And to the lonely boy came a new dawn of
\par sympathy and inspiration.  The shadowy, formless thing--the temptation
\par of Hate, that hovered between him and the world--grew fainter and less
\par sinister.  It did not wholly fade away, but diffused itself and
\par lingered thick at the edges.  Through it the child now first saw the
\par blue and gold of life,--the sun-swept road that ran 'twixt heaven and
\par earth until in one far-off wan wavering line they met and kissed.  A
\par vision of life came to the growing boy,--mystic, wonderful.  He raised
\par his head, stretched himself, breathed deep of the fresh new air.
\par Yonder, behind the forests, he heard strange sounds; then glinting
\par through the trees he saw, far, far away, the bronzed hosts of a nation
\par calling,--calling faintly, calling loudly.  He heard the hateful clank
\par of their chains; he felt them cringe and grovel, and there rose within
\par him a protest and a prophecy.  And he girded himself to walk down the
\par world.
\par 
\par A voice and vision called him to be a priest,--a seer to lead the
\par uncalled out of the house of bondage.  He saw the headless host turn
\par toward him like the whirling of mad waters,--he stretched forth his
\par hands eagerly, and then, even as he stretched them, suddenly there
\par swept across the vision the temptation of Despair.
\par 
\par They were not wicked men,--the problem of life is not the problem of
\par the wicked,--they were calm, good men, Bishops of the Apostolic Church
\par of God, and strove toward righteousness.  They said slowly, "It is all
\par very natural--it is even commendable; but the General Theological
\par Seminary of the Episcopal Church cannot admit a Negro."  And when that
\par thin, half-grotesque figure still haunted their doors, they put their
\par hands kindly, half sorrowfully, on his shoulders, and said, "Now,--of
\par course, we--we know how YOU feel about it; but you see it is
\par impossible,--that is--well--it is premature.  Sometime, we
\par trust--sincerely trust--all such distinctions will fade away; but now
\par the world is as it is."
\par 
\par This was the temptation of Despair; and the young man fought it
\par doggedly.  Like some grave shadow he flitted by those halls, pleading,
\par arguing, half angrily demanding admittance, until there came the final
\par NO: until men hustled the disturber away, marked him as foolish,
\par unreasonable, and injudicious, a vain rebel against God's law.  And
\par then from that Vision Splendid all the glory faded slowly away, and
\par left an earth gray and stern rolling on beneath a dark despair.  Even
\par the kind hands that stretched themselves toward him from out the depths
\par of that dull morning seemed but parts of the purple shadows.  He saw
\par them coldly, and asked, "Why should I strive by special grace when the
\par way of the world is closed to me?"  All gently yet, the hands urged him
\par on,--the hands of young John Jay, that daring father's daring son; the
\par hands of the good folk of Boston, that free city.  And yet, with a way
\par to the priesthood of the Church open at last before him, the cloud
\par lingered there; and even when in old St. Paul's the venerable Bishop
\par raised his white arms above the Negro deacon--even then the burden had
\par not lifted from that heart, for there had passed a glory from the earth.
\par 
\par And yet the fire through which Alexander Crummell went did not burn in
\par vain.  Slowly and more soberly he took up again his plan of life.  More
\par critically he studied the situation.  Deep down below the slavery and
\par servitude of the Negro people he saw their fatal weaknesses, which long
\par years of mistreatment had emphasized.  The dearth of strong moral
\par character, of unbending righteousness, he felt, was their great
\par shortcoming, and here he would begin.  He would gather the best of his
\par people into some little Episcopal chapel and there lead, teach, and
\par inspire them, till the leaven spread, till the children grew, till the
\par world hearkened, till--till--and then across his dream gleamed some
\par faint after-glow of that first fair vision of youth--only an
\par after-glow, for there had passed a glory from the earth.
\par 
\par One day--it was in 1842, and the springtide was struggling merrily with
\par the May winds of New England--he stood at last in his own chapel in
\par Providence, a priest of the Church.  The days sped by, and the dark
\par young clergyman labored; he wrote his sermons carefully; he intoned his
\par prayers with a soft, earnest voice; he haunted the streets and accosted
\par the wayfarers; he visited the sick, and knelt beside the dying.  He
\par worked and toiled, week by week, day by day, month by month.  And yet
\par month by month the congregation dwindled, week by week the hollow walls
\par echoed more sharply, day by day the calls came fewer and fewer, and day
\par by day the third temptation sat clearer and still more clearly within
\par the Veil; a temptation, as it were, bland and smiling, with just a
\par shade of mockery in its smooth tones.  First it came casually, in the
\par cadence of a voice: "Oh, colored folks?  Yes."  Or perhaps more
\par definitely: "What do you EXPECT?"  In voice and gesture lay the
\par doubt--the temptation of Doubt.  How he hated it, and stormed at it
\par furiously!  "Of course they are capable," he cried; "of course they can
\par learn and strive and achieve--" and "Of course," added the temptation
\par softly, "they do nothing of the sort."  Of all the three temptations,
\par this one struck the deepest.  Hate?  He had outgrown so childish a
\par thing.  Despair?  He had steeled his right arm against it, and fought
\par it with the vigor of determination.  But to doubt the worth of his
\par life-work,--to doubt the destiny and capability of the race his soul
\par loved because it was his; to find listless squalor instead of eager
\par endeavor; to hear his own lips whispering, "They do not care; they
\par cannot know; they are dumb driven cattle,--why cast your pearls before
\par swine?"--this, this seemed more than man could bear; and he closed the
\par door, and sank upon the steps of the chancel, and cast his robe upon
\par the floor and writhed.
\par 
\par The evening sunbeams had set the dust to dancing in the gloomy chapel
\par when he arose.  He folded his vestments, put away the hymn-books, and
\par closed the great Bible.  He stepped out into the twilight, looked back
\par upon the narrow little pulpit with a weary smile, and locked the door.
\par Then he walked briskly to the Bishop, and told the Bishop what the
\par Bishop already knew.  "I have failed," he said simply.  And gaining
\par courage by the confession, he added: "What I need is a larger
\par constituency.  There are comparatively few Negroes here, and perhaps
\par they are not of the best.  I must go where the field is wider, and try
\par again."  So the Bishop sent him to Philadelphia, with a letter to
\par Bishop Onderdonk.
\par 
\par Bishop Onderdonk lived at the head of six white steps,--corpulent,
\par red-faced, and the author of several thrilling tracts on Apostolic
\par Succession.  It was after dinner, and the Bishop had settled himself
\par for a pleasant season of contemplation, when the bell must needs ring,
\par and there must burst in upon the Bishop a letter and a thin, ungainly
\par Negro.  Bishop Onderdonk read the letter hastily and frowned.
\par Fortunately, his mind was already clear on this point; and he cleared
\par his brow and looked at Crummell.  Then he said, slowly and
\par impressively: "I will receive you into this diocese on one condition:
\par no Negro priest can sit in my church convention, and no Negro church
\par must ask for representation there."
\par 
\par I sometimes fancy I can see that tableau: the frail black figure,
\par nervously twitching his hat before the massive abdomen of Bishop
\par Onderdonk; his threadbare coat thrown against the dark woodwork of the
\par bookcases, where Fox's "Lives of the Martyrs" nestled happily beside
\par "The Whole Duty of Man."  I seem to see the wide eyes of the Negro
\par wander past the Bishop's broadcloth to where the swinging glass doors
\par of the cabinet glow in the sunlight.  A little blue fly is trying to
\par cross the yawning keyhole.  He marches briskly up to it, peers into the
\par chasm in a surprised sort of way, and rubs his feelers reflectively;
\par then he essays its depths, and, finding it bottomless, draws back
\par again.  The dark-faced priest finds himself wondering if the fly too
\par has faced its Valley of Humiliation, and if it will plunge into
\par it,--when lo! it spreads its tiny wings and buzzes merrily across,
\par leaving the watcher wingless and alone.
\par 
\par Then the full weight of his burden fell upon him.  The rich walls
\par wheeled away, and before him lay the cold rough moor winding on through
\par life, cut in twain by one thick granite ridge,--here, the Valley of
\par Humiliation; yonder, the Valley of the Shadow of Death.  And I know not
\par which be darker,--no, not I. But this I know: in yonder Vale of the
\par Humble stand to-day a million swarthy men, who willingly would
\par 
\par   ". . . bear the whips and scorns of time,
\par   The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
\par   The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
\par   The insolence of office, and the spurns
\par   That patient merit of the unworthy takes,"--
\par 
\par all this and more would they bear did they but know that this were
\par sacrifice and not a meaner thing.  So surged the thought within that
\par lone black breast.  The Bishop cleared his throat suggestively; then,
\par recollecting that there was really nothing to say, considerately said
\par nothing, only sat tapping his foot impatiently.  But Alexander Crummell
\par said, slowly and heavily: "I will never enter your diocese on such
\par terms."  And saying this, he turned and passed into the Valley of the
\par Shadow of Death.  You might have noted only the physical dying, the
\par shattered frame and hacking cough; but in that soul lay deeper death
\par than that.  He found a chapel in New York,--the church of his father;
\par he labored for it in poverty and starvation, scorned by his fellow
\par priests.  Half in despair, he wandered across the sea, a beggar with
\par outstretched hands.  Englishmen clasped them,--Wilberforce and Stanley,
\par Thirwell and Ingles, and even Froude and Macaulay; Sir Benjamin Brodie
\par bade him rest awhile at Queen's College in Cambridge, and there he
\par lingered, struggling for health of body and mind, until he took his
\par degree in '53.  Restless still, and unsatisfied, he turned toward
\par Africa, and for long years, amid the spawn of the slave-smugglers,
\par sought a new heaven and a new earth.
\par 
\par So the man groped for light; all this was not Life,--it was the
\par world-wandering of a soul in search of itself, the striving of one who
\par vainly sought his place in the world, ever haunted by the shadow of a
\par death that is more than death,--the passing of a soul that has missed
\par its duty.  Twenty years he wandered,--twenty years and more; and yet
\par the hard rasping question kept gnawing within him, "What, in God's
\par name, am I on earth for?"  In the narrow New York parish his soul
\par seemed cramped and smothered.  In the fine old air of the English
\par University he heard the millions wailing over the sea.  In the wild
\par fever-cursed swamps of West Africa he stood helpless and alone.
\par 
\par You will not wonder at his weird pilgrimage,--you who in the swift
\par whirl of living, amid its cold paradox and marvellous vision, have
\par fronted life and asked its riddle face to face.  And if you find that
\par riddle hard to read, remember that yonder black boy finds it just a
\par little harder; if it is difficult for you to find and face your duty,
\par it is a shade more difficult for him; if your heart sickens in the
\par blood and dust of battle, remember that to him the dust is thicker and
\par the battle fiercer.  No wonder the wanderers fall!  No wonder we point
\par to thief and murderer, and haunting prostitute, and the never-ending
\par throng of unhearsed dead!  The Valley of the Shadow of Death gives few
\par of its pilgrims back to the world.
\par 
\par But Alexander Crummell it gave back.  Out of the temptation of Hate,
\par and burned by the fire of Despair, triumphant over Doubt, and steeled
\par by Sacrifice against Humiliation, he turned at last home across the
\par waters, humble and strong, gentle and determined.  He bent to all the
\par gibes and prejudices, to all hatred and discrimination, with that rare
\par courtesy which is the armor of pure souls.  He fought among his own,
\par the low, the grasping, and the wicked, with that unbending
\par righteousness which is the sword of the just.  He never faltered, he
\par seldom complained; he simply worked, inspiring the young, rebuking the
\par old, helping the weak, guiding the strong.
\par 
\par So he grew, and brought within his wide influence all that was best of
\par those who walk within the Veil.  They who live without knew not nor
\par dreamed of that full power within, that mighty inspiration which the
\par dull gauze of caste decreed that most men should not know.  And now
\par that he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose
\par dear memory I bring this little tribute.  I can see his face still,
\par dark and heavy-lined beneath his snowy hair; lighting and shading, now
\par with inspiration for the future, now in innocent pain at some human
\par wickedness, now with sorrow at some hard memory from the past.  The
\par more I met Alexander Crummell, the more I felt how much that world was
\par losing which knew so little of him.  In another age he might have sat
\par among the elders of the land in purple-bordered toga; in another
\par country mothers might have sung him to the cradles.
\par 
\par He did his work,--he did it nobly and well; and yet I sorrow that here
\par he worked alone, with so little human sympathy.  His name to-day, in
\par this broad land, means little, and comes to fifty million ears laden
\par with no incense of memory or emulation.  And herein lies the tragedy of
\par the age: not that men are poor,--all men know something of poverty; not
\par that men are wicked,--who is good? not that men are ignorant,--what is
\par Truth?  Nay, but that men know so little of men.
\par 
\par 
\par He sat one morning gazing toward the sea.  He smiled and said, "The
\par gate is rusty on the hinges."  That night at starrise a wind came
\par moaning out of the west to blow the gate ajar, and then the soul I
\par loved fled like a flame across the Seas, and in its seat sat Death.
\par 
\par I wonder where he is to-day?  I wonder if in that dim world beyond, as
\par he came gliding in, there rose on some wan throne a King,--a dark and
\par pierced Jew, who knows the writhings of the earthly damned, saying, as
\par he laid those heart-wrung talents down, "Well done!" while round about
\par the morning stars sat singing.

\par Carlisle Street runs westward from the centre of Johnstown, across a
\par great black bridge, down a hill and up again, by little shops and
\par meat-markets, past single-storied homes, until suddenly it stops
\par against a wide green lawn.  It is a broad, restful place, with two
\par large buildings outlined against the west.  When at evening the winds
\par come swelling from the east, and the great pall of the city's smoke
\par hangs wearily above the valley, then the red west glows like a
\par dreamland down Carlisle Street, and, at the tolling of the supper-bell,
\par throws the passing forms of students in dark silhouette against the
\par sky.  Tall and black, they move slowly by, and seem in the sinister
\par light to flit before the city like dim warning ghosts.  Perhaps they
\par are; for this is Wells Institute, and these black students have few
\par dealings with the white city below.
\par 
\par And if you will notice, night after night, there is one dark form that
\par ever hurries last and late toward the twinkling lights of Swain
\par Hall,--for Jones is never on time.  A long, straggling fellow he is,
\par brown and hard-haired, who seems to be growing straight out of his
\par clothes, and walks with a half-apologetic roll.  He used perpetually to
\par set the quiet dining-room into waves of merriment, as he stole to his
\par place after the bell had tapped for prayers; he seemed so perfectly
\par awkward.  And yet one glance at his face made one forgive him
\par much,--that broad, good-natured smile in which lay no bit of art or
\par artifice, but seemed just bubbling good-nature and genuine satisfaction
\par with the world.
\par 
\par He came to us from Altamaha, away down there beneath the gnarled oaks
\par of Southeastern Georgia, where the sea croons to the sands and the
\par sands listen till they sink half drowned beneath the waters, rising
\par only here and there in long, low islands.  The white folk of Altamaha
\par voted John a good boy,--fine plough-hand, good in the rice-fields,
\par handy everywhere, and always good-natured and respectful.  But they
\par shook their heads when his mother wanted to send him off to school.
\par "It'll spoil him,--ruin him," they said; and they talked as though they
\par knew.  But full half the black folk followed him proudly to the
\par station, and carried his queer little trunk and many bundles.  And
\par there they shook and shook hands, and the girls kissed him shyly and
\par the boys clapped him on the back.  So the train came, and he pinched
\par his little sister lovingly, and put his great arms about his mother's
\par neck, and then was away with a puff and a roar into the great yellow
\par world that flamed and flared about the doubtful pilgrim.  Up the coast
\par they hurried, past the squares and palmettos of Savannah, through the
\par cotton-fields and through the weary night, to Millville, and came with
\par the morning to the noise and bustle of Johnstown.
\par 
\par And they that stood behind, that morning in Altamaha, and watched the
\par train as it noisily bore playmate and brother and son away to the
\par world, had thereafter one ever-recurring word,--"When John comes." Then
\par what parties were to be, and what speakings in the churches; what new
\par furniture in the front room,--perhaps even a new front room; and there
\par would be a new schoolhouse, with John as teacher; and then perhaps a
\par big wedding; all this and more--when John comes.  But the white people
\par shook their heads.
\par 
\par At first he was coming at Christmas-time,--but the vacation proved too
\par short; and then, the next summer,--but times were hard and schooling
\par costly, and so, instead, he worked in Johnstown.  And so it drifted to
\par the next summer, and the next,--till playmates scattered, and mother
\par grew gray, and sister went up to the Judge's kitchen to work.  And
\par still the legend lingered,--"When John comes."
\par 
\par Up at the Judge's they rather liked this refrain; for they too had a
\par John--a fair-haired, smooth-faced boy, who had played many a long
\par summer's day to its close with his darker namesake.  "Yes, sir!  John
\par is at Princeton, sir," said the broad-shouldered gray-haired Judge
\par every morning as he marched down to the post-office.  "Showing the
\par Yankees what a Southern gentleman can do," he added; and strode home
\par again with his letters and papers.  Up at the great pillared house they
\par lingered long over the Princeton letter,--the Judge and his frail wife,
\par his sister and growing daughters.  "It'll make a man of him," said the
\par Judge, "college is the place."  And then he asked the shy little
\par waitress, "Well, Jennie, how's your John?" and added reflectively, "Too
\par bad, too bad your mother sent him off--it will spoil him."  And the
\par waitress wondered.
\par 
\par Thus in the far-away Southern village the world lay waiting, half
\par consciously, the coming of two young men, and dreamed in an
\par inarticulate way of new things that would be done and new thoughts that
\par all would think.  And yet it was singular that few thought of two
\par Johns,--for the black folk thought of one John, and he was black; and
\par the white folk thought of another John, and he was white.  And neither
\par world thought the other world's thought, save with a vague unrest.
\par 
\par Up in Johnstown, at the Institute, we were long puzzled at the case of
\par John Jones.  For a long time the clay seemed unfit for any sort of
\par moulding.  He was loud and boisterous, always laughing and singing, and
\par never able to work consecutively at anything.  He did not know how to
\par study; he had no idea of thoroughness; and with his tardiness,
\par carelessness, and appalling good-humor, we were sore perplexed.  One
\par night we sat in faculty-meeting, worried and serious; for Jones was in
\par trouble again.  This last escapade was too much, and so we solemnly
\par voted "that Jones, on account of repeated disorder and inattention to
\par work, be suspended for the rest of the term."
\par 
\par It seemed to us that the first time life ever struck Jones as a really
\par serious thing was when the Dean told him he must leave school.  He
\par stared at the gray-haired man blankly, with great eyes.  "Why,--why,"
\par he faltered, "but--I haven't graduated!"  Then the Dean slowly and
\par clearly explained, reminding him of the tardiness and the carelessness,
\par of the poor lessons and neglected work, of the noise and disorder,
\par until the fellow hung his head in confusion.  Then he said quickly,
\par "But you won't tell mammy and sister,--you won't write mammy, now will
\par you?  For if you won't I'll go out into the city and work, and come
\par back next term and show you something."  So the Dean promised
\par faithfully, and John shouldered his little trunk, giving neither word
\par nor look to the giggling boys, and walked down Carlisle Street to the
\par great city, with sober eyes and a set and serious face.
\par 
\par Perhaps we imagined it, but someway it seemed to us that the serious
\par look that crept over his boyish face that afternoon never left it
\par again.  When he came back to us he went to work with all his rugged
\par strength.  It was a hard struggle, for things did not come easily to
\par him,--few crowding memories of early life and teaching came to help him
\par on his new way; but all the world toward which he strove was of his own
\par building, and he builded slow and hard.  As the light dawned
\par lingeringly on his new creations, he sat rapt and silent before the
\par vision, or wandered alone over the green campus peering through and
\par beyond the world of men into a world of thought.  And the thoughts at
\par times puzzled him sorely; he could not see just why the circle was not
\par square, and carried it out fifty-six decimal places one
\par midnight,--would have gone further, indeed, had not the matron rapped
\par for lights out.  He caught terrible colds lying on his back in the
\par meadows of nights, trying to think out the solar system; he had grave
\par doubts as to the ethics of the Fall of Rome, and strongly suspected the
\par Germans of being thieves and rascals, despite his textbooks; he
\par pondered long over every new Greek word, and wondered why this meant
\par that and why it couldn't mean something else, and how it must have felt
\par to think all things in Greek.  So he thought and puzzled along for
\par himself,--pausing perplexed where others skipped merrily, and walking
\par steadily through the difficulties where the rest stopped and
\par surrendered.
\par 
\par Thus he grew in body and soul, and with him his clothes seemed to grow
\par and arrange themselves; coat sleeves got longer, cuffs appeared, and
\par collars got less soiled.  Now and then his boots shone, and a new
\par dignity crept into his walk.  And we who saw daily a new thoughtfulness
\par growing in his eyes began to expect something of this plodding boy.
\par Thus he passed out of the preparatory school into college, and we who
\par watched him felt four more years of change, which almost transformed
\par the tall, grave man who bowed to us commencement morning.  He had left
\par his queer thought-world and come back to a world of motion and of men.
\par He looked now for the first time sharply about him, and wondered he had
\par seen so little before.  He grew slowly to feel almost for the first
\par time the Veil that lay between him and the white world; he first
\par noticed now the oppression that had not seemed oppression before,
\par differences that erstwhile seemed natural, restraints and slights that
\par in his boyhood days had gone unnoticed or been greeted with a laugh.
\par He felt angry now when men did not call him "Mister," he clenched his
\par hands at the "Jim Crow" cars, and chafed at the color-line that hemmed
\par in him and his.  A tinge of sarcasm crept into his speech, and a vague
\par bitterness into his life; and he sat long hours wondering and planning
\par a way around these crooked things.  Daily he found himself shrinking
\par from the choked and narrow life of his native town.  And yet he always
\par planned to go back to Altamaha,--always planned to work there.  Still,
\par more and more as the day approached he hesitated with a nameless dread;
\par and even the day after graduation he seized with eagerness the offer of
\par the Dean to send him North with the quartette during the summer
\par vacation, to sing for the Institute.  A breath of air before the
\par plunge, he said to himself in half apology.
\par 
\par It was a bright September afternoon, and the streets of New York were
\par brilliant with moving men.  They reminded John of the sea, as he sat in
\par the square and watched them, so changelessly changing, so bright and
\par dark, so grave and gay.  He scanned their rich and faultless clothes,
\par the way they carried their hands, the shape of their hats; he peered
\par into the hurrying carriages.  Then, leaning back with a sigh, he said,
\par "This is the World."  The notion suddenly seized him to see where the
\par world was going; since many of the richer and brighter seemed hurrying
\par all one way.  So when a tall, light-haired young man and a little
\par talkative lady came by, he rose half hesitatingly and followed them.
\par Up the street they went, past stores and gay shops, across a broad
\par square, until with a hundred others they entered the high portal of a
\par great building.
\par 
\par He was pushed toward the ticket-office with the others, and felt in his
\par pocket for the new five-dollar bill he had hoarded.  There seemed
\par really no time for hesitation, so he drew it bravely out, passed it to
\par the busy clerk, and received simply a ticket but no change.  When at
\par last he realized that he had paid five dollars to enter he knew not
\par what, he stood stockstill amazed.  "Be careful," said a low voice
\par behind him; "you must not lynch the colored gentleman simply because
\par he's in your way," and a girl looked up roguishly into the eyes of her
\par fair-haired escort.  A shade of annoyance passed over the escort's
\par face.  "You WILL not understand us at the South," he said half
\par impatiently, as if continuing an argument.  "With all your professions,
\par one never sees in the North so cordial and intimate relations between
\par white and black as are everyday occurrences with us.  Why, I remember
\par my closest playfellow in boyhood was a little Negro named after me, and
\par surely no two,--WELL!" The man stopped short and flushed to the roots
\par of his hair, for there directly beside his reserved orchestra chairs
\par sat the Negro he had stumbled over in the hallway.  He hesitated and
\par grew pale with anger, called the usher and gave him his card, with a
\par few peremptory words, and slowly sat down.  The lady deftly changed the
\par subject.
\par 
\par All this John did not see, for he sat in a half-daze minding the scene
\par about him; the delicate beauty of the hall, the faint perfume, the
\par moving myriad of men, the rich clothing and low hum of talking seemed
\par all a part of a world so different from his, so strangely more
\par beautiful than anything he had known, that he sat in dreamland, and
\par started when, after a hush, rose high and clear the music of
\par Lohengrin's swan.  The infinite beauty of the wail lingered and swept
\par through every muscle of his frame, and put it all a-tune.  He closed
\par his eyes and grasped the elbows of the chair, touching unwittingly the
\par lady's arm.  And the lady drew away.  A deep longing swelled in all his
\par heart to rise with that clear music out of the dirt and dust of that
\par low life that held him prisoned and befouled.  If he could only live up
\par in the free air where birds sang and setting suns had no touch of
\par blood!  Who had called him to be the slave and butt of all?  And if he
\par had called, what right had he to call when a world like this lay open
\par before men?
\par 
\par Then the movement changed, and fuller, mightier harmony swelled away.
\par He looked thoughtfully across the hall, and wondered why the beautiful
\par gray-haired woman looked so listless, and what the little man could be
\par whispering about.  He would not like to be listless and idle, he
\par thought, for he felt with the music the movement of power within him.
\par If he but had some master-work, some life-service, hard,--aye, bitter
\par hard, but without the cringing and sickening servility, without the
\par cruel hurt that hardened his heart and soul.  When at last a soft
\par sorrow crept across the violins, there came to him the vision of a
\par far-off home, the great eyes of his sister, and the dark drawn face of
\par his mother.  And his heart sank below the waters, even as the sea-sand
\par sinks by the shores of Altamaha, only to be lifted aloft again with
\par that last ethereal wail of the swan that quivered and faded away into
\par the sky.
\par 
\par It left John sitting so silent and rapt that he did not for some time
\par notice the usher tapping him lightly on the shoulder and saying
\par politely, "Will you step this way, please, sir?"  A little surprised,
\par he arose quickly at the last tap, and, turning to leave his seat,
\par looked full into the face of the fair-haired young man.  For the first
\par time the young man recognized his dark boyhood playmate, and John knew
\par that it was the Judge's son.  The White John started, lifted his hand,
\par and then froze into his chair; the black John smiled lightly, then
\par grimly, and followed the usher down the aisle.  The manager was sorry,
\par very, very sorry,--but he explained that some mistake had been made in
\par selling the gentleman a seat already disposed of; he would refund the
\par money, of course,--and indeed felt the matter keenly, and so forth,
\par and--before he had finished John was gone, walking hurriedly across the
\par square and down the broad streets, and as he passed the park he
\par buttoned his coat and said, "John Jones, you're a natural-born fool."
\par Then he went to his lodgings and wrote a letter, and tore it up; he
\par wrote another, and threw it in the fire.  Then he seized a scrap of
\par paper and wrote: "Dear Mother and Sister--I am coming--John."
\par 
\par "Perhaps," said John, as he settled himself on the train, "perhaps I am
\par to blame myself in struggling against my manifest destiny simply
\par because it looks hard and unpleasant.  Here is my duty to Altamaha
\par plain before me; perhaps they'll let me help settle the Negro problems
\par there,--perhaps they won't.  'I will go in to the King, which is not
\par according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.'" And then he mused
\par and dreamed, and planned a life-work; and the train flew south.
\par 
\par Down in Altamaha, after seven long years, all the world knew John was
\par coming.  The homes were scrubbed and scoured,--above all, one; the
\par gardens and yards had an unwonted trimness, and Jennie bought a new
\par gingham.  With some finesse and negotiation, all the dark Methodists
\par and Presbyterians were induced to join in a monster welcome at the
\par Baptist Church; and as the day drew near, warm discussions arose on
\par every corner as to the exact extent and nature of John's
\par accomplishments.  It was noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he
\par came.  The black town flocked to the depot, with a little of the white
\par at the edges,--a happy throng, with "Good-mawnings" and "Howdys" and
\par laughing and joking and jostling.  Mother sat yonder in the window
\par watching; but sister Jennie stood on the platform, nervously fingering
\par her dress, tall and lithe, with soft brown skin and loving eyes peering
\par from out a tangled wilderness of hair.  John rose gloomily as the train
\par stopped, for he was thinking of the "Jim Crow" car; he stepped to the
\par platform, and paused: a little dingy station, a black crowd gaudy and
\par dirty, a half-mile of dilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of
\par mud.  An overwhelming sense of the sordidness and narrowness of it all
\par seized him; he looked in vain for his mother, kissed coldly the tall,
\par strange girl who called him brother, spoke a short, dry word here and
\par there; then, lingering neither for handshaking nor gossip, started
\par silently up the street, raising his hat merely to the last eager old
\par aunty, to her open-mouthed astonishment.  The people were distinctly
\par bewildered.  This silent, cold man,--was this John?  Where was his
\par smile and hearty hand-grasp?  "'Peared kind o' down in the mouf," said
\par the Methodist preacher thoughtfully.  "Seemed monstus stuck up,"
\par complained a Baptist sister.  But the white postmaster from the edge of
\par the crowd expressed the opinion of his folks plainly.  "That damn
\par Nigger," said he, as he shouldered the mail and arranged his tobacco,
\par "has gone North and got plum full o' fool notions; but they won't work
\par in Altamaha."  And the crowd melted away.
\par 
\par The meeting of welcome at the Baptist Church was a failure.  Rain
\par spoiled the barbecue, and thunder turned the milk in the ice-cream.
\par When the speaking came at night, the house was crowded to overflowing.
\par The three preachers had especially prepared themselves, but somehow
\par John's manner seemed to throw a blanket over everything,--he seemed so
\par cold and preoccupied, and had so strange an air of restraint that the
\par Methodist brother could not warm up to his theme and elicited not a
\par single "Amen"; the Presbyterian prayer was but feebly responded to, and
\par even the Baptist preacher, though he wakened faint enthusiasm, got so
\par mixed up in his favorite sentence that he had to close it by stopping
\par fully fifteen minutes sooner than he meant.  The people moved uneasily
\par in their seats as John rose to reply.  He spoke slowly and
\par methodically.  The age, he said, demanded new ideas; we were far
\par different from those men of the seventeenth and eighteenth
\par centuries,--with broader ideas of human brotherhood and destiny.  Then
\par he spoke of the rise of charity and popular education, and particularly
\par of the spread of wealth and work.  The question was, then, he added
\par reflectively, looking at the low discolored ceiling, what part the
\par Negroes of this land would take in the striving of the new century.  He
\par sketched in vague outline the new Industrial School that might rise
\par among these pines, he spoke in detail of the charitable and
\par philanthropic work that might be organized, of money that might be
\par saved for banks and business.  Finally he urged unity, and deprecated
\par especially religious and denominational bickering.  "To-day," he said,
\par with a smile, "the world cares little whether a man be Baptist or
\par Methodist, or indeed a churchman at all, so long as he is good and
\par true.  What difference does it make whether a man be baptized in river
\par or washbowl, or not at all?  Let's leave all that littleness, and look
\par higher."  Then, thinking of nothing else, he slowly sat down.  A
\par painful hush seized that crowded mass.  Little had they understood of
\par what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue, save the last word about
\par baptism; that they knew, and they sat very still while the clock
\par ticked.  Then at last a low suppressed snarl came from the Amen corner,
\par and an old bent man arose, walked over the seats, and climbed straight
\par up into the pulpit.  He was wrinkled and black, with scant gray and
\par tufted hair; his voice and hands shook as with palsy; but on his face
\par lay the intense rapt look of the religious fanatic.  He seized the
\par Bible with his rough, huge hands; twice he raised it inarticulate, and
\par then fairly burst into words, with rude and awful eloquence.  He
\par quivered, swayed, and bent; then rose aloft in perfect majesty, till
\par the people moaned and wept, wailed and shouted, and a wild shrieking
\par arose from the corners where all the pent-up feeling of the hour
\par gathered itself and rushed into the air.  John never knew clearly what
\par the old man said; he only felt himself held up to scorn and scathing
\par denunciation for trampling on the true Religion, and he realized with
\par amazement that all unknowingly he had put rough, rude hands on
\par something this little world held sacred.  He arose silently, and passed
\par out into the night.  Down toward the sea he went, in the fitful
\par starlight, half conscious of the girl who followed timidly after him.
\par When at last he stood upon the bluff, he turned to his little sister
\par and looked upon her sorrowfully, remembering with sudden pain how
\par little thought he had given her.  He put his arm about her and let her
\par passion of tears spend itself on his shoulder.
\par 
\par Long they stood together, peering over the gray unresting water.
\par 
\par "John," she said, "does it make every one--unhappy when they study and
\par learn lots of things?"
\par 
\par He paused and smiled.  "I am afraid it does," he said.
\par 
\par "And, John, are you glad you studied?"
\par 
\par "Yes," came the answer, slowly but positively.
\par 
\par She watched the flickering lights upon the sea, and said thoughtfully,
\par "I wish I was unhappy,--and--and," putting both arms about his neck, "I
\par think I am, a little, John."
\par 
\par It was several days later that John walked up to the Judge's house to
\par ask for the privilege of teaching the Negro school.  The Judge himself
\par met him at the front door, stared a little hard at him, and said
\par brusquely, "Go 'round to the kitchen door, John, and wait."  Sitting on
\par the kitchen steps, John stared at the corn, thoroughly perplexed.  What
\par on earth had come over him?  Every step he made offended some one.  He
\par had come to save his people, and before he left the depot he had hurt
\par them.  He sought to teach them at the church, and had outraged their
\par deepest feelings.  He had schooled himself to be respectful to the
\par Judge, and then blundered into his front door.  And all the time he had
\par meant right,--and yet, and yet, somehow he found it so hard and strange
\par to fit his old surroundings again, to find his place in the world about
\par him.  He could not remember that he used to have any difficulty in the
\par past, when life was glad and gay.  The world seemed smooth and easy
\par then.  Perhaps,--but his sister came to the kitchen door just then and
\par said the Judge awaited him.
\par 
\par The Judge sat in the dining-room amid his morning's mail, and he did
\par not ask John to sit down.  He plunged squarely into the business.
\par "You've come for the school, I suppose.  Well John, I want to speak to
\par you plainly.  You know I'm a friend to your people.  I've helped you
\par and your family, and would have done more if you hadn't got the notion
\par of going off.  Now I like the colored people, and sympathize with all
\par their reasonable aspirations; but you and I both know, John, that in
\par this country the Negro must remain subordinate, and can never expect to
\par be the equal of white men.  In their place, your people can be honest
\par and respectful; and God knows, I'll do what I can to help them.  But
\par when they want to reverse nature, and rule white men, and marry white
\par women, and sit in my parlor, then, by God! we'll hold them under if we
\par have to lynch every Nigger in the land.  Now, John, the question is,
\par are you, with your education and Northern notions, going to accept the
\par situation and teach the darkies to be faithful servants and laborers as
\par your fathers were,--I knew your father, John, he belonged to my
\par brother, and he was a good Nigger.  Well--well, are you going to be
\par like him, or are you going to try to put fool ideas of rising and
\par equality into these folks' heads, and make them discontented and
\par unhappy?"
\par 
\par "I am going to accept the situation, Judge Henderson," answered John,
\par with a brevity that did not escape the keen old man.  He hesitated a
\par moment, and then said shortly, "Very well,--we'll try you awhile.
\par Good-morning."
\par 
\par It was a full month after the opening of the Negro school that the
\par other John came home, tall, gay, and headstrong.  The mother wept, the
\par sisters sang.  The whole white town was glad.  A proud man was the
\par Judge, and it was a goodly sight to see the two swinging down Main
\par Street together.  And yet all did not go smoothly between them, for the
\par younger man could not and did not veil his contempt for the little
\par town, and plainly had his heart set on New York.  Now the one cherished
\par ambition of the Judge was to see his son mayor of Altamaha,
\par representative to the legislature, and--who could say?--governor of
\par Georgia.  So the argument often waxed hot between them.  "Good heavens,
\par father," the younger man would say after dinner, as he lighted a cigar
\par and stood by the fireplace, "you surely don't expect a young fellow
\par like me to settle down permanently in this--this God-forgotten town
\par with nothing but mud and Negroes?"  "I did," the Judge would answer
\par laconically; and on this particular day it seemed from the gathering
\par scowl that he was about to add something more emphatic, but neighbors
\par had already begun to drop in to admire his son, and the conversation
\par drifted.
\par 
\par "Heah that John is livenin' things up at the darky school," volunteered
\par the postmaster, after a pause.
\par 
\par "What now?" asked the Judge, sharply.
\par 
\par "Oh, nothin' in particulah,--just his almighty air and uppish ways.
\par B'lieve I did heah somethin' about his givin' talks on the French
\par Revolution, equality, and such like.  He's what I call a dangerous
\par Nigger."
\par 
\par "Have you heard him say anything out of the way?"
\par 
\par "Why, no,--but Sally, our girl, told my wife a lot of rot.  Then, too,
\par I don't need to heah: a Nigger what won't say 'sir' to a white man,
\par or--"
\par 
\par "Who is this John?" interrupted the son.
\par 
\par "Why, it's little black John, Peggy's son,--your old playfellow."
\par 
\par The young man's face flushed angrily, and then he laughed.
\par 
\par "Oh," said he, "it's the darky that tried to force himself into a seat
\par beside the lady I was escorting--"
\par 
\par But Judge Henderson waited to hear no more.  He had been nettled all
\par day, and now at this he rose with a half-smothered oath, took his hat
\par and cane, and walked straight to the schoolhouse.
\par 
\par For John, it had been a long, hard pull to get things started in the
\par rickety old shanty that sheltered his school.  The Negroes were rent
\par into factions for and against him, the parents were careless, the
\par children irregular and dirty, and books, pencils, and slates largely
\par missing.  Nevertheless, he struggled hopefully on, and seemed to see at
\par last some glimmering of dawn.  The attendance was larger and the
\par children were a shade cleaner this week.  Even the booby class in
\par reading showed a little comforting progress.  So John settled himself
\par with renewed patience this afternoon.
\par 
\par "Now, Mandy," he said cheerfully, "that's better; but you mustn't chop
\par your words up so: 'If--the-man--goes.' Why, your little brother even
\par wouldn't tell a story that way, now would he?"
\par 
\par "Naw, suh, he cain't talk."
\par 
\par "All right; now let's try again: 'If the man--'
\par 
\par "John!"
\par 
\par The whole school started in surprise, and the teacher half arose, as
\par the red, angry face of the Judge appeared in the open doorway.
\par 
\par "John, this school is closed.  You children can go home and get to
\par work.  The white people of Altamaha are not spending their money on
\par black folks to have their heads crammed with impudence and lies.  Clear
\par out!  I'll lock the door myself."
\par 
\par Up at the great pillared house the tall young son wandered aimlessly
\par about after his father's abrupt departure.  In the house there was
\par little to interest him; the books were old and stale, the local
\par newspaper flat, and the women had retired with headaches and sewing.
\par He tried a nap, but it was too warm.  So he sauntered out into the
\par fields, complaining disconsolately, "Good Lord! how long will this
\par imprisonment last!"  He was not a bad fellow,--just a little spoiled
\par and self-indulgent, and as headstrong as his proud father.  He seemed a
\par young man pleasant to look upon, as he sat on the great black stump at
\par the edge of the pines idly swinging his legs and smoking.  "Why, there
\par isn't even a girl worth getting up a respectable flirtation with," he
\par growled.  Just then his eye caught a tall, willowy figure hurrying
\par toward him on the narrow path.  He looked with interest at first, and
\par then burst into a laugh as he said, "Well, I declare, if it isn't
\par Jennie, the little brown kitchen-maid!  Why, I never noticed before
\par what a trim little body she is.  Hello, Jennie!  Why, you haven't
\par kissed me since I came home," he said gaily.  The young girl stared at
\par him in surprise and confusion,--faltered something inarticulate, and
\par attempted to pass.  But a wilful mood had seized the young idler, and
\par he caught at her arm.  Frightened, she slipped by; and half
\par mischievously he turned and ran after her through the tall pines.
\par 
\par Yonder, toward the sea, at the end of the path, came John slowly, with
\par his head down.  He had turned wearily homeward from the schoolhouse;
\par then, thinking to shield his mother from the blow, started to meet his
\par sister as she came from work and break the news of his dismissal to
\par her.  "I'll go away," he said slowly; "I'll go away and find work, and
\par send for them.  I cannot live here longer."  And then the fierce,
\par buried anger surged up into his throat.  He waved his arms and hurried
\par wildly up the path.
\par 
\par The great brown sea lay silent.  The air scarce breathed.  The dying
\par day bathed the twisted oaks and mighty pines in black and gold.  There
\par came from the wind no warning, not a whisper from the cloudless sky.
\par There was only a black man hurrying on with an ache in his heart,
\par seeing neither sun nor sea, but starting as from a dream at the
\par frightened cry that woke the pines, to see his dark sister struggling
\par in the arms of a tall and fair-haired man.
\par 
\par He said not a word, but, seizing a fallen limb, struck him with all the
\par pent-up hatred of his great black arm, and the body lay white and still
\par beneath the pines, all bathed in sunshine and in blood.  John looked at
\par it dreamily, then walked back to the house briskly, and said in a soft
\par voice, "Mammy, I'm going away--I'm going to be free."
\par 
\par She gazed at him dimly and faltered, "No'th, honey, is yo' gwine No'th
\par agin?"
\par 
\par He looked out where the North Star glistened pale above the waters, and
\par said, "Yes, mammy, I'm going--North."
\par 
\par Then, without another word, he went out into the narrow lane, up by the
\par straight pines, to the same winding path, and seated himself on the
\par great black stump, looking at the blood where the body had lain.
\par Yonder in the gray past he had played with that dead boy, romping
\par together under the solemn trees.  The night deepened; he thought of the
\par boys at Johnstown.  He wondered how Brown had turned out, and Carey?
\par And Jones,--Jones?  Why, he was Jones, and he wondered what they would
\par all say when they knew, when they knew, in that great long dining-room
\par with its hundreds of merry eyes.  Then as the sheen of the starlight
\par stole over him, he thought of the gilded ceiling of that vast concert
\par hall, heard stealing toward him the faint sweet music of the swan.
\par Hark! was it music, or the hurry and shouting of men?  Yes, surely!
\par Clear and high the faint sweet melody rose and fluttered like a living
\par thing, so that the very earth trembled as with the tramp of horses and
\par murmur of angry men.
\par 
\par He leaned back and smiled toward the sea, whence rose the strange
\par melody, away from the dark shadows where lay the noise of horses
\par galloping, galloping on.  With an effort he roused himself, bent
\par forward, and looked steadily down the pathway, softly humming the "Song
\par of the Bride,"--
\par 
\par   "Freudig gefuhrt, ziehet dahin."
\par 
\par Amid the trees in the dim morning twilight he watched their shadows
\par dancing and heard their horses thundering toward him, until at last
\par they came sweeping like a storm, and he saw in front that haggard
\par white-haired man, whose eyes flashed red with fury.  Oh, how he pitied
\par him,--pitied him,--and wondered if he had the coiling twisted rope.
\par Then, as the storm burst round him, he rose slowly to his feet and
\par turned his closed eyes toward the Sea.
\par 
\par And the world whistled in his ears.

\par 
\par Of the Sorrow Songs
\par 
\par   I walk through the churchyard
\par       To lay this body down;
\par   I know moon-rise, I know star-rise;
\par   I walk in the moonlight, I walk in the starlight;
\par   I'll lie in the grave and stretch out my arms,
\par   I'll go to judgment in the evening of the day,
\par   And my soul and thy soul shall meet that day,
\par       When I lay this body down.
\par 
\par   NEGRO SONG.
\par 
\par 
\par They that walked in darkness sang songs in the olden days--Sorrow
\par Songs--for they were weary at heart.  And so before each thought that I
\par have written in this book I have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these
\par weird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men.
\par Ever since I was a child these songs have stirred me strangely.  They
\par came out of the South unknown to me, one by one, and yet at once I knew
\par them as of me and of mine.  Then in after years when I came to
\par Nashville I saw the great temple builded of these songs towering over
\par the pale city.  To me Jubilee Hall seemed ever made of the songs
\par themselves, and its bricks were red with the blood and dust of toil.
\par Out of them rose for me morning, noon, and night, bursts of wonderful
\par melody, full of the voices of my brothers and sisters, full of the
\par voices of the past.
\par 
\par Little of beauty has America given the world save the rude grandeur God
\par himself stamped on her bosom; the human spirit in this new world has
\par expressed itself in vigor and ingenuity rather than in beauty.  And so
\par by fateful chance the Negro folk-song--the rhythmic cry of the
\par slave--stands to-day not simply as the sole American music, but as the
\par most beautiful expression of human experience born this side the seas.
\par It has been neglected, it has been, and is, half despised, and above
\par all it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood; but
\par notwithstanding, it still remains as the singular spiritual heritage of
\par the nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people.
\par 
\par Away back in the thirties the melody of these slave songs stirred the
\par nation, but the songs were soon half forgotten.  Some, like "Near the
\par lake where drooped the willow," passed into current airs and their
\par source was forgotten; others were caricatured on the "minstrel" stage
\par and their memory died away.  Then in war-time came the singular Port
\par Royal experiment after the capture of Hilton Head, and perhaps for the
\par first time the North met the Southern slave face to face and heart to
\par heart with no third witness.  The Sea Islands of the Carolinas, where
\par they met, were filled with a black folk of primitive type, touched and
\par moulded less by the world about them than any others outside the Black
\par Belt.  Their appearance was uncouth, their language funny, but their
\par hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.
\par Thomas Wentworth Higginson hastened to tell of these songs, and Miss
\par McKim and others urged upon the world their rare beauty.  But the world
\par listened only half credulously until the Fisk Jubilee Singers sang the
\par slave songs so deeply into the world's heart that it can never wholly
\par forget them again.
\par 
\par There was once a blacksmith's son born at Cadiz, New York, who in the
\par changes of time taught school in Ohio and helped defend Cincinnati from
\par Kirby Smith.  Then he fought at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg and
\par finally served in the Freedmen's Bureau at Nashville.  Here he formed a
\par Sunday-school class of black children in 1866, and sang with them and
\par taught them to sing.  And then they taught him to sing, and when once
\par the glory of the Jubilee songs passed into the soul of George L. White,
\par he knew his life-work was to let those Negroes sing to the world as
\par they had sung to him.  So in 1871 the pilgrimage of the Fisk Jubilee
\par Singers began.  North to Cincinnati they rode,--four half-clothed black
\par boys and five girl-women,--led by a man with a cause and a purpose.
\par They stopped at Wilberforce, the oldest of Negro schools, where a black
\par bishop blessed them.  Then they went, fighting cold and starvation,
\par shut out of hotels, and cheerfully sneered at, ever northward; and ever
\par the magic of their song kept thrilling hearts, until a burst of
\par applause in the Congregational Council at Oberlin revealed them to the
\par world.  They came to New York and Henry Ward Beecher dared to welcome
\par them, even though the metropolitan dailies sneered at his "Nigger
\par Minstrels."  So their songs conquered till they sang across the land
\par and across the sea, before Queen and Kaiser, in Scotland and Ireland,
\par Holland and Switzerland.  Seven years they sang, and brought back a
\par hundred and fifty thousand dollars to found Fisk University.
\par 
\par Since their day they have been imitated--sometimes well, by the singers
\par of Hampton and Atlanta, sometimes ill, by straggling quartettes.
\par Caricature has sought again to spoil the quaint beauty of the music,
\par and has filled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears
\par scarce know from the real.  But the true Negro folk-song still lives in
\par the hearts of those who have heard them truly sung and in the hearts of
\par the Negro people.
\par 
\par What are these songs, and what do they mean?  I know little of music
\par and can say nothing in technical phrase, but I know something of men,
\par and knowing them, I know that these songs are the articulate message of
\par the slave to the world.  They tell us in these eager days that life was
\par joyous to the black slave, careless and happy.  I can easily believe
\par this of some, of many.  But not all the past South, though it rose from
\par the dead, can gainsay the heart-touching witness of these songs.  They
\par are the music of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment;
\par they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer
\par world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.
\par 
\par The songs are indeed the siftings of centuries; the music is far more
\par ancient than the words, and in it we can trace here and there signs of
\par development.  My grandfather's grandmother was seized by an evil Dutch
\par trader two centuries ago; and coming to the valleys of the Hudson and
\par Housatonic, black, little, and lithe, she shivered and shrank in the
\par harsh north winds, looked longingly at the hills, and often crooned a
\par heathen melody to the child between her knees, thus:
\par 
\par   Do ba-na co-ba, ge-ne me, ge-ne me!
\par   Do ba-na co-ba, ge-ne me, ge-ne me!
\par   Ben d' nu-li, nu-li, nu-li, ben d' le.
\par 
\par 
\par The child sang it to his children and they to their children's
\par children, and so two hundred years it has travelled down to us and we
\par sing it to our children, knowing as little as our fathers what its
\par words may mean, but knowing well the meaning of its music.
\par 
\par This was primitive African music; it may be seen in larger form in the
\par strange chant which heralds "The Coming of John":
\par 
\par   "You may bury me in the East,
\par    You may bury me in the West,
\par    But I'll hear the trumpet sound in that morning,"
\par 
\par --the voice of exile.
\par 
\par Ten master songs, more or less, one may pluck from the forest of
\par melody-songs of undoubted Negro origin and wide popular currency, and
\par songs peculiarly characteristic of the slave.  One of these I have just
\par mentioned.  Another whose strains begin this book is "Nobody knows the
\par trouble I've seen."  When, struck with a sudden poverty, the United
\par States refused to fulfill its promises of land to the freedmen, a
\par brigadier-general went down to the Sea Islands to carry the news.  An
\par old woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this song; all
\par the mass joined with her, swaying.  And the soldier wept.
\par 
\par The third song is the cradle-song of death which all men know,-"Swing
\par low, sweet chariot,"--whose bars begin the life story of "Alexander
\par Crummell."  Then there is the song of many waters, "Roll, Jordan,
\par roll," a mighty chorus with minor cadences.  There were many songs of
\par the fugitive like that which opens "The Wings of Atalanta," and the
\par more familiar "Been a-listening."  The seventh is the song of the End
\par and the Beginning--"My Lord, what a mourning! when the stars begin to
\par fall"; a strain of this is placed before "The Dawn of Freedom."  The
\par song of groping--"My way's cloudy"--begins "The Meaning of Progress";
\par the ninth is the song of this chapter--"Wrestlin' Jacob, the day is
\par a-breaking,"--a paean of hopeful strife.  The last master song is the
\par song of songs--"Steal away,"--sprung from "The Faith of the Fathers."
\par 
\par There are many others of the Negro folk-songs as striking and
\par characteristic as these, as, for instance, the three strains in the
\par third, eighth, and ninth chapters; and others I am sure could easily
\par make a selection on more scientific principles.  There are, too, songs
\par that seem to be a step removed from the more primitive types: there is
\par the maze-like medley, "Bright sparkles," one phrase of which heads "The
\par Black Belt"; the Easter carol, "Dust, dust and ashes"; the dirge, "My
\par mother's took her flight and gone home"; and that burst of melody
\par hovering over "The Passing of the First-Born"--"I hope my mother will
\par be there in that beautiful world on high."
\par 
\par These represent a third step in the development of the slave song, of
\par which "You may bury me in the East" is the first, and songs like "March
\par on" (chapter six) and "Steal away" are the second.  The first is
\par African music, the second Afro-American, while the third is a blending
\par of Negro music with the music heard in the foster land.  The result is
\par still distinctively Negro and the method of blending original, but the
\par elements are both Negro and Caucasian.  One might go further and find a
\par fourth step in this development, where the songs of white America have
\par been distinctively influenced by the slave songs or have incorporated
\par whole phrases of Negro melody, as "Swanee River" and "Old Black Joe."
\par Side by side, too, with the growth has gone the debasements and
\par imitations--the Negro "minstrel" songs, many of the "gospel" hymns, and
\par some of the contemporary "coon" songs,--a mass of music in which the
\par novice may easily lose himself and never find the real Negro melodies.
\par 
\par In these songs, I have said, the slave spoke to the world.  Such a
\par message is naturally veiled and half articulate.  Words and music have
\par lost each other and new and cant phrases of a dimly understood theology
\par have displaced the older sentiment.  Once in a while we catch a strange
\par word of an unknown tongue, as the "Mighty Myo," which figures as a
\par river of death; more often slight words or mere doggerel are joined to
\par music of singular sweetness.  Purely secular songs are few in number,
\par partly because many of them were turned into hymns by a change of
\par words, partly because the frolics were seldom heard by the stranger,
\par and the music less often caught.  Of nearly all the songs, however, the
\par music is distinctly sorrowful.  The ten master songs I have mentioned
\par tell in word and music of trouble and exile, of strife and hiding; they
\par grope toward some unseen power and sigh for rest in the End.
\par 
\par The words that are left to us are not without interest, and, cleared of
\par evident dross, they conceal much of real poetry and meaning beneath
\par conventional theology and unmeaning rhapsody.  Like all primitive folk,
\par the slave stood near to Nature's heart.  Life was a "rough and rolling
\par sea" like the brown Atlantic of the Sea Islands; the "Wilderness" was
\par the home of God, and the "lonesome valley" led to the way of life.
\par "Winter'll soon be over," was the picture of life and death to a
\par tropical imagination.  The sudden wild thunderstorms of the South awed
\par and impressed the Negroes,--at times the rumbling seemed to them
\par "mournful," at times imperious:
\par 
\par   "My Lord calls me,
\par   He calls me by the thunder,
\par   The trumpet sounds it in my soul."
\par 
\par 
\par The monotonous toil and exposure is painted in many words.  One sees
\par the ploughmen in the hot, moist furrow, singing:
\par 
\par   "Dere's no rain to wet you,
\par    Dere's no sun to burn you,
\par    Oh, push along, believer,
\par    I want to go home."
\par 
\par 
\par The bowed and bent old man cries, with thrice-repeated wail:
\par 
\par   "O Lord, keep me from sinking down,"
\par 
\par and he rebukes the devil of doubt who can whisper:
\par 
\par   "Jesus is dead and God's gone away."
\par 
\par 
\par Yet the soul-hunger is there, the restlessness of the savage, the wail
\par of the wanderer, and the plaint is put in one little phrase:
\par 
\par   My soul wants something that's new, that's new
\par 
\par 
\par Over the inner thoughts of the slaves and their relations one with
\par another the shadow of fear ever hung, so that we get but glimpses here
\par and there, and also with them, eloquent omissions and silences.  Mother
\par and child are sung, but seldom father; fugitive and weary wanderer call
\par for pity and affection, but there is little of wooing and wedding; the
\par rocks and the mountains are well known, but home is unknown.  Strange
\par blending of love and helplessness sings through the refrain:
\par 
\par   "Yonder's my ole mudder,
\par    Been waggin' at de hill so long;
\par   'Bout time she cross over,
\par    Git home bime-by."
\par 
\par Elsewhere comes the cry of the "motherless" and the "Farewell,
\par farewell, my only child."
\par 
\par Love-songs are scarce and fall into two categories--the frivolous and
\par light, and the sad.  Of deep successful love there is ominous silence,
\par and in one of the oldest of these songs there is a depth of history and
\par meaning:
\par 
\par   Poor Ro-sy, poor gal; Poor Ro-sy,
\par   poor gal; Ro-sy break my poor heart,
\par   Heav'n shall-a-be my home.
\par 
\par 
\par A black woman said of the song, "It can't be sung without a full heart
\par and a troubled sperrit."  The same voice sings here that sings in the
\par German folk-song:
\par 
\par     "Jetz Geh i' an's brunele, trink' aber net."
\par 
\par 
\par Of death the Negro showed little fear, but talked of it familiarly and
\par even fondly as simply a crossing of the waters, perhaps--who
\par knows?--back to his ancient forests again.  Later days transfigured his
\par fatalism, and amid the dust and dirt the toiler sang:
\par 
\par   "Dust, dust and ashes, fly over my grave,
\par    But the Lord shall bear my spirit home."
\par 
\par 
\par The things evidently borrowed from the surrounding world undergo
\par characteristic change when they enter the mouth of the slave.
\par Especially is this true of Bible phrases.  "Weep, O captive daughter of
\par Zion," is quaintly turned into "Zion, weep-a-low," and the wheels of
\par Ezekiel are turned every way in the mystic dreaming of the slave, till
\par he says:
\par 
\par  "There's a little wheel a-turnin' in-a-my heart."
\par 
\par 
\par As in olden time, the words of these hymns were improvised by some
\par leading minstrel of the religious band.  The circumstances of the
\par gathering, however, the rhythm of the songs, and the limitations of
\par allowable thought, confined the poetry for the most part to single or
\par double lines, and they seldom were expanded to quatrains or longer
\par tales, although there are some few examples of sustained efforts,
\par chiefly paraphrases of the Bible.  Three short series of verses have
\par always attracted me,--the one that heads this chapter, of one line of
\par which Thomas Wentworth Higginson has fittingly said, "Never, it seems
\par to me, since man first lived and suffered was his infinite longing for
\par peace uttered more plaintively."  The second and third are descriptions
\par of the Last Judgment,--the one a late improvisation, with some traces
\par of outside influence:
\par 
\par 
\par   "Oh, the stars in the elements are falling,
\par    And the moon drips away into blood,
\par    And the ransomed of the Lord are returning unto God,
\par    Blessed be the name of the Lord."
\par 
\par And the other earlier and homelier picture from the low coast lands:
\par 
\par   "Michael, haul the boat ashore,
\par    Then you'll hear the horn they blow,
\par    Then you'll hear the trumpet sound,
\par    Trumpet sound the world around,
\par    Trumpet sound for rich and poor,
\par    Trumpet sound the Jubilee,
\par    Trumpet sound for you and me."
\par 
\par 
\par Through all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope--a
\par faith in the ultimate justice of things.  The minor cadences of despair
\par change often to triumph and calm confidence.  Sometimes it is faith in
\par life, sometimes a faith in death, sometimes assurance of boundless
\par justice in some fair world beyond.  But whichever it is, the meaning is
\par always clear: that sometime, somewhere, men will judge men by their
\par souls and not by their skins.  Is such a hope justified?  Do the Sorrow
\par Songs sing true?
\par 
\par The silently growing assumption of this age is that the probation of
\par races is past, and that the backward races of to-day are of proven
\par inefficiency and not worth the saving.  Such an assumption is the
\par arrogance of peoples irreverent toward Time and ignorant of the deeds
\par of men.  A thousand years ago such an assumption, easily possible,
\par would have made it difficult for the Teuton to prove his right to life.
\par Two thousand years ago such dogmatism, readily welcome, would have
\par scouted the idea of blond races ever leading civilization.  So wofully
\par unorganized is sociological knowledge that the meaning of progress, the
\par meaning of "swift" and "slow" in human doing, and the limits of human
\par perfectability, are veiled, unanswered sphinxes on the shores of
\par science.  Why should AEschylus have sung two thousand years before
\par Shakespeare was born?  Why has civilization flourished in Europe, and
\par flickered, flamed, and died in Africa?  So long as the world stands
\par meekly dumb before such questions, shall this nation proclaim its
\par ignorance and unhallowed prejudices by denying freedom of opportunity
\par to those who brought the Sorrow Songs to the Seats of the Mighty?
\par 
\par Your country?  How came it yours?  Before the Pilgrims landed we were
\par here.  Here we have brought our three gifts and mingled them with
\par yours: a gift of story and song--soft, stirring melody in an
\par ill-harmonized and unmelodious land; the gift of sweat and brawn to
\par beat back the wilderness, conquer the soil, and lay the foundations of
\par this vast economic empire two hundred years earlier than your weak
\par hands could have done it; the third, a gift of the Spirit.  Around us
\par the history of the land has centred for thrice a hundred years; out of
\par the nation's heart we have called all that was best to throttle and
\par subdue all that was worst; fire and blood, prayer and sacrifice, have
\par billowed over this people, and they have found peace only in the altars
\par of the God of Right.  Nor has our gift of the Spirit been merely
\par passive.  Actively we have woven ourselves with the very warp and woof
\par of this nation,--we fought their battles, shared their sorrow, mingled
\par our blood with theirs, and generation after generation have pleaded
\par with a headstrong, careless people to despise not Justice, Mercy, and
\par Truth, lest the nation be smitten with a curse.  Our song, our toil,
\par our cheer, and warning have been given to this nation in
\par blood-brotherhood.  Are not these gifts worth the giving?  Is not this
\par work and striving?  Would America have been America without her Negro
\par people?
\par 
\par Even so is the hope that sang in the songs of my fathers well sung.  If
\par somewhere in this whirl and chaos of things there dwells Eternal Good,
\par pitiful yet masterful, then anon in His good time America shall rend
\par the Veil and the prisoned shall go free.  Free, free as the sunshine
\par trickling down the morning into these high windows of mine, free as
\par yonder fresh young voices welling up to me from the caverns of brick
\par and mortar below--swelling with song, instinct with life, tremulous
\par treble and darkening bass.  My children, my little children, are
\par singing to the sunshine, and thus they sing:
\par 
\par   Let us cheer the wea-ry trav-el-ler,
\par   Cheer the wea-ry trav-el-ler, Let us
\par   cheer the wea-ry trav-el-ler
\par   A-long the heav-en-ly way.
\par 
\par And the traveller girds himself, and sets his face toward the Morning,
\par and goes his way.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par The Afterthought
\par 
\par Hear my cry, O God the Reader; vouchsafe that this my book fall not
\par still-born into the world wilderness.  Let there spring, Gentle One,
\par from out its leaves vigor of thought and thoughtful deed to reap the
\par harvest wonderful.  Let the ears of a guilty people tingle with truth,
\par and seventy millions sigh for the righteousness which exalteth nations,
\par in this drear day when human brotherhood is mockery and a snare.  Thus
\par in Thy good time may infinite reason turn the tangle straight, and
\par these crooked marks on a fragile leaf be not indeed
