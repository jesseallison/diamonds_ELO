the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; 
and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.

s right bank allows ships to drop out of the river. In evident defiance of nature, they descend as much as thirty-three feet, then go off to the west or south. This, to say the least, bespeaks a rare relationship between a river and adjacent terrain
\emdash any river, anywhere, let alone the third-ranking river on earth. The adjacent terrain is Cajun country, in a geographical sense the apex of the French Acadian world, which forms a triangle in southern Louisiana, w
ith its base the Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Mississippi almost to Texas, its two sides converging up here near the lock\emdash 
and including neither New Orleans nor Baton Rouge. The people of the local parishes (Pointe Coupee Parish, Avoyelles Parish) would call this the apex of Cajun country in every possible sense\emdash 
no one more emphatically than the lockmaster, on whose face one day I noticed a spreading astonishment as he watched me remove from my pocket a red bandanna.
\par \'93You are a coonass with that red handkerchief,\'94 he said.
\par A coonass being a Cajun, I threw him an appreciative smile. I told him that I always have a bandanna in my pocket, wherever I happen to be\emdash in New York as in Maine or Louisiana, not to mention New Jersey (my home)\emdash and sometimes the color
 is blue. He said, \'93Blue is the sign of a Yankee. But that red handkerchief\emdash with that, you are pure coonass.\'94
 The lockmaster wore a white hard hat above his creased and deeply tanned face, his full but not overloaded frame. The nameplate on his desk said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 rabalais}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 .
\par The navigation lock is not a formal place. When I first met Rabalais, six months before, he was sitting with his staff at 10 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 a.m}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 . eating homemade bread, macaroni and cheese, and a mound of rice that was concealed beneath what he called \'93smoked old-chicken gravy.\'94 He said, \'93Get yourself a plate of that.\'94
 As I went somewhat heavily for the old chicken, Rabalais said to the others, \'93He\rquote s pure coonass. I knew it.\'94
\par If I was pure coonass, I would like to know what that made Rabalais\emdash Norris F. Rabalais, b
orn and raised on a farm near Simmesport, in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. When Rabalais was a child, there was no navigation lock to lower ships from the Mississippi. The water just poured out\emdash boats with it\emdash 
and flowed on into a distributary waterscape know
n as Atchafalaya. In each decade since about 1860, the Atchafalaya River had drawn off more water from the Mississippi than it had in the decade before. By the late nineteen-forties, when Rabalais was in his teens, the volume approached one-third. As the 
A
tchafalaya widened and deepened, eroding headward, offering the Mississippi an increasingly attractive alternative, it was preparing for nothing less than an absolute capture: before long, it would take all of the Mississippi, and itself become the master
 stream. Rabalais said, \'93They used to teach us in high school that one day there was going to be structures up here to control the flow of that water, but I never dreamed I was going to be on one. Somebody way back yonder\emdash 
which is dead and gone now\emdash visualized it. We had some pretty sharp teachers.\'94
\par The Mississippi River, with its sand and silt, has created most of Louisiana, and it could not h
ave done so by remaining in one channel. If it had, southern Louisiana would be a long narrow peninsula reaching into the Gulf of Mexico. Southern Louisiana exists in its present form because the Mississippi River has jumped here and there within an arc a
bout two hundred miles wide, like a pianist playing with one hand\emdash frequently and radically changing course, surging over the left or the right bank to go off in utterly new directions. Always it is the river\rquote 
s purpose to get to the Gulf by the shortest and 
steepest gradient. As the mouth advances southward and the river lengthens, the gradient declines, the current slows, and sediment builds up the bed. Eventually, it builds up so much that the river spills to one side. Major shifts of that nature have tend
ed to occur roughly once a millennium. The Mississippi\rquote 
s main channel of three thousand years ago is now the quiet water of Bayou Teche, which mimics the shape of the Mississippi. Along Bayou Teche, on the high ground of ancient natural levees, are Jeanerette, Breaux Bridge, Broussard, Olivier\emdash 
arcuate strings of Cajun towns. Eight hundred years before the birth of Christ, the channel was captured from the east. It shifted abruptly and flowed in that direction for about a thousand years. In the second century }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 a.d}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 ., it was captured again, and taken south, by the now unprepossessing Bayou Lafourche, which, by the year 1000, was losing its hegemony to the river
\rquote s present course, through the region that would be known as Plaquemines. By the nineteen-fifties, the M
ississippi River had advanced so far past New Orleans and out into the Gulf that it was about to shift again, and its offspring Atchafalaya was ready to receive it. By the route of the Atchafalaya, the distance across the delta plain was a hundred and for
ty-five miles\emdash well under half the length of the route of the master stream.
\par For the Mississippi to make such a change was completely natural, but in the interval since the last shift Europeans had settled beside the river, a nation had developed, and the nation could not afford nature. The consequences of the Atchafalaya\rquote 
s conquest of the Mississippi would include but not be limited to the demise of Baton Rouge and the virtual destruction of New Orleans. With its fresh water gone, its harbor a silt bar, its 
economy disconnected from inland commerce, New Orleans would turn into New Gomorrah. Moreover, there were so many big industries between the two cities that at night they made the river glow like a worm. As a result of settlement patterns, this reach of t
he Mississippi had long been known as \'93the German coast,\'94
 and now, with B. F. Goodrich, E. I. du Pont, Union Carbide, Reynolds Metals, Shell, Mobil, Texaco, Exxon, Monsanto, Uniroyal, Georgia-Pacific, Hydrocarbon Industries, Vulcan Materials, Nalco Chemical
, Freeport Chemical, Dow Chemical, Allied Chemical, Stauffer Chemical, Hooker Chemicals, Rubicon Chemicals, American Petrofina\emdash with an infrastructural concentration equalled in few other places\emdash it was often called \'93the American Ruhr.\'94
 The industries were t
here because of the river. They had come for its navigational convenience and its fresh water. They would not, and could not, linger beside a tidal creek. For nature to take its course was simply unthinkable. The Sixth World War would do less damage to so
uthern Louisiana. Nature, in this place, had become an enemy of the state.
\par Rabalais works for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Some years ago, the Corps made a film that showed the navigation lock and a complex of associated structures built in an effort to prevent the capture of the Mississippi. The narrator said, \'93
This nation has a large and powerful adversary. Our opponent could cause the United States to lose nearly all her seaborne commerce, to lose her standing as first among trading nations. . . .We are fighting Mother Nature. . . .It\rquote 
s a battle we have to fight day by day, year by year; the health of our economy depends on victory.\'94
\par Rabalais was in on the action from the beginning, working as a construction inspector. Here by the site of the navigati
on lock was where the battle had begun. An old meander bend of the Mississippi was the conduit through which water had been escaping into the Atchafalaya. Complicating the scene, the old meander bend had also served as the mouth of the Red River. Coming i
n from the northwest, from Texas via Shreveport, the Red River had been a tributary of the Mississippi for a couple of thousand years\emdash 
until the nineteen-forties, when the Atchafalaya captured it and drew it away. The capture of the Red increased the Atchafalaya\rquote 
s power as it cut down the country beside the Mississippi. On a map, these entangling watercourses had come to look like the letter \'93H.\'94
 The Mississippi was the right-hand side. The Atchafalaya and the captured Red were the left-hand side. The crosspi
ece, scarcely seven miles long, was the former meander bend, which the people of the parish had long since named Old River. Sometimes enough water would pour out of the Mississippi and through Old River to quintuple the falls at Niagara. It was at Old Riv
er that the United States was going to lose its status among the world\rquote s trading nations. It was at Old River that New Orleans would be lost, Baton Rouge would be lost. At Old River, we would lose the American Ruhr. The Army\rquote 
s name for its operation there was Old River Control.

Rabalais gestured across the lock toward what seemed to be a pair of placid lakes separated by a trapezoidal earth dam a hundred feet high. It weighed five million tons, and it had stopped Old River. It had cut Old 
River in two. The severed ends were sitting there filling up with weeds. Where the Atchafalaya had entrapped the Mississippi, bigmouth bass were now in charge. The navigation lock had been dug beside this monument. The big dam, like the lock, was fitted i
nto the mainline levee of the Mississippi. In Rabalais\rquote 
s pickup, we drove on the top of the dam, and drifted as wed through Old River country. On this day, he said, the water on the Mississippi side was eighteen feet above sea level, while the water on the 
Atchafalaya side was five feet above sea level. Cattle were grazing on the slopes of the levees, and white horses with white colts, in deep-green grass. Behind the levees, the fields were flat and reached to rows of distant trees. Very early in the mornin
g
, a low fog had covered the fields. The sun, just above the horizon, was large and ruddy in the mist, rising slowly, like a hot-air baboon. This was a countryside of corn and soybeans, of grain-fed-catfish ponds, of feed stores and Kingdom Halls in crossr
o
ad towns. There were small neat cemeteries with ranks of white sarcophagi raised a foot or two aboveground, notwithstanding the protection of the levees. There were tarpapered cabins on concrete pylons, and low brick houses under planted pines. Pickups un
der the pines. If this was a form of battlefield, it was not unlike a great many battlefields\emdash landscapes so quiet they belie their story. Most battlefields, though, are places where something happened once. Here it would happen indefinitely.
\par We went out to the Mississippi. Still indistinct in mist, it looked like a piece of the sea. Rabalais said, \'93That\rquote s a wide booger, right there.\'94 In the spring high water of vintage years\emdash 1927, 1937, 1973\emdash 
more than two million cubic feet of water had gone by this place in
 every second. Sixty-five kilotons per second. By the mouth of the inflow channel leading to the lock were rock jetties, articulated concrete mattress revetments, and other heavy defenses. Rabalais observed that this particular site was no more vulnerable
 than almost any other point in this reach of river that ran so close to the Atchafalaya plain. There were countless places where a breakout might occur: \'93It has a tendency to go through just anywheres you can call for.\'94
\par Why, then, had the Mississippi not jumped the bank and long since diverted to the Atchafalaya?
\par \'93Because they\rquote re watching it close,\'94 said Rabalais. \'93It\rquote s under close surveillance.\'94
\par After the Corps dammed Old River, in 1963, the engineers could not just walk away, like roofers who had fixed a 
leak. In the early planning stages, they had considered doing that, but there were certain effects they could not overlook. The Atchafalaya, after all, was a distributary of the Mississippi\emdash 
the major one, and, as it happened, the only one worth mentioning 
that the Corps had not already plugged. In time of thundering flood, the Atchafalaya was used as a safety valve, to relieve a good deal of pressure and help keep New Orleans from ending up in Yucat\'e1
n. The Atchafalaya was also the source of the water in the
 swamps and bayous of the Cajun world. It was the water supply of small cities and countless towns. Its upper reaches were surrounded by farms. The Corps was not in a political or moral position to kill the Atchafalaya. It had to feed it water. By the pri
n
ciples of nature, the more the Atchafalaya was given, the more it would want to take, because it was the steeper stream. The more it was given, the deeper it would make its bed. The difference in level between the Atchafalaya and the Mississippi would con
t
inue to increase, magnifying the conditions for capture. The Corps would have to deal with that. The Corps would have to build something that could give the Atchafalaya a portion of the Mississippi and at the same time prevent it from taking all. In effec
t, the Corps would have to build a Fort Laramie: a place where the natives could buy flour and firearms but where the gates could be closed if they attacked.
\par Ten miles upriver from the navigation lock, where the collective sediments were thought to be more 
firm, they dug into a piece of dry ground and built what appeared for a time to be an incongruous, waterless bridge. Five hundred and sixty-six feet long, it stood parallel to the Mississippi and about a thousand yards back from the water. Between its abu
tments were ten piers, framing eleven gates that could be lifted or dropped, opened or shut, like windows. To this structure, and through it, there soon came a new Old River\emdash 
an excavated channel leading in from the Mississippi and out seven miles to the Red
-Atchafalaya. The Corps was not intending to accommodate nature. Its engineers were intending to control it in space and arrest it in time. In 1950, shortly before the project began, the Atchafalaya was taking thirty per cent of the water that came down f
rom the north to Old River. This water was known as the latitude flow, and it consisted of a little in the Red, a lot in the Mississippi. The United States Congress, in its deliberations, decided that \'93
the distribution of flow and sediment in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers is now in desirable proportions and should be so maintained.\'94
 The Corps was thereby ordered to preserve 1950. In perpetuity, at Old River, thirty per cent of the latitude flow was to pass to the Atchafalaya.
\par The device that resembl
ed a ten-pier bridge was technically a sill, or weir, and it was put on line in 1963, in an orchestrated sequence of events that flourished the art of civil engineering. The old Old River was closed. The new Old River was opened. The water, as it crossed 
the sill from the Mississippi\rquote s level to the Atchafalaya\rquote 
s, tore to white shreds in the deafening turbulence of a great new falls, from lip to basin the construction of the Corps. More or less simultaneously, the navigation lock opened its chamber. Now ever
ything had changed and nothing had changed. Boats could still drop away from the river. The ratio of waters continued as before\emdash 
this for the American Ruhr, that for the ecosystems of the Cajun swamps. Withal, there was a change of command, as the Army replaced nature.
\par In time, people would come to suggest that there was about these enterprises an element of hauteur. A professor of law at Tulane University, for example, would assign it third place in the annals of arrogance. His name was Oliver Houck. \'93The g
reatest arrogance was the stealing of the sun,\'94 he said. \'93
The second-greatest arrogance is running rivers backward. The third-greatest arrogance is trying to hold the Mississippi in place. The ancient channels of the river go almost to Texas. Human beings have tried to restrict the river to one course\emdash 
that\rquote s where the arrogance began.\'94 The Corps listens closely to things like that and files them in its archives. Houck had a point. Bold it was indeed to dig a fresh conduit in the very ground where one river 
had prepared to trap another, bolder yet to build a structure there meant to be in charge of what might happen.
\par Some people went further than Houck, and said that they thought the structure would fail. In 1980, for example, a study published by the Water Resources Research Institute, at Louisiana State University, described Old River as \'93
the scene of a direct confrontation between the United States Government and the Mississippi River,\'94 and\emdash all constructions of the Corps notwithstanding\emdash awarded the victory to the Mississippi River. \'93
Just when this will occur cannot be predicted,\'94 the report concluded. \'93It could happen next year, during the next decade, or sometime in the next thirty or forty years. But the final outcome is simply a matter of time and it is o
nly prudent to prepare for it.\'94
\par The Corps thought differently, saying, \'93We can\rquote t let that happen. We are charged by Congress not to let that happen.\'94 Its promotional film referred to Old River Control as \'93a good soldier.\'94 Old River Control was, moreover, \'93
the keystone of the comprehensive flood-protection project for the lower Mississippi Valley,\'94
 and nothing was going to remove the keystone. People arriving at New Orleans District Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, were confronted at the door by a muralled collage of maps and pictures and bold letters unequivocally declaring, \'93
The Old River Control Structures, located about two hundred miles above New Orleans on the Mississippi River, prevent the Mississippi from changing course by controlling flows diverted into the Atchafalaya Basin.\'94
\par No one\rquote s opinions were based on more intimate knowledge than those of LeRoy Dugas, Rabalais\rquote s upstream counterpart\emdash the manager of the apparatus that controlled the flow at Old River. Like Rabalais, he was Acadian and
 of the country. Dugie\emdash as he is universally called\emdash had worked at Old River Control since 1963, when the water started flowing. In years to follow, colonels and generals would seek his counsel. \'93
Those professors at L.S.U. say that whatever we do we\rquote re going to lose the system,\'94 he remarked one day at Old River, and, after a pause, added, \'93Maybe they\rquote re right.\'94
 His voice had the sound of water over rock. In pitch, it was lower than a helicon tuba. Better to hear him indoors, in his operations office, away from the structure\rquote s competing thunders. \'93Maybe they\rquote re right,\'94 he repeated. \'93
We feel that we can hold the river. We\rquote re going to try. Whenever you try to control nature, you\rquote ve got one strike against you.\'94
\par Dugie\rquote s face, weathered and deeply tanned, was saved from looking weary by the alertness and the humor in his eyes. He wore a large, lettered belt buckle that said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 
to help control the mississippi}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 . \'93I was originally born in Morganza,\'94 he told me. \'93Thirty miles down the road. I have lived in Pointe Coupee Pari
sh all my life. Once, I even closed my domicile and went to work in Texas for the Corps\emdash but you always come back.\'94 (Rabalais also\emdash as he puts it\emdash \'93left out of here one time,\'94 but not for long.) All through Dugie\rquote 
s youth, of course, the Mississippi had spille
d out freely to feed the Atchafalaya. He took the vagaries of the waters for granted, not to mention the supremacy of their force in flood. He was a naval gunner on Liberty ships in the South Pacific during the Second World War, and within a year or two o
f his return was astonished to hear that the Corps of Engineers was planning to restrain Old River. \'93They were going to try to control the flow,\'94 he said. \'93I thought they had lost their marbles.\'94
\par Outside, on the roadway that crosses the five-hundred-and-six
ty-six-foot structure, one could readily understand where the marbles might have gone. Even at this time of modest normal flow, we looked down into a rage of water. It was running at about twelve miles an hour\emdash 
significantly faster than the Yukon after breakup\emdash 
and it was pounding into the so-called stilling basin on the downstream side, the least still place you would ever see. The No. 10 rapids of the Grand Canyon, which cannot be run without risk of life, resemble the Old River stilling basin, but the rapi
ds of the canyon are a fifth as wide. The Susitna River is sometimes more like it\emdash 
melted glacier ice from the Alaska Range. Huge trucks full of hardwood logs kept coming from the north to cross the structure, on their way to a chipping mill at Simmesport. One could scarcely hear them as they went by.
\par There was a high sill next to this one\emdash a separate weir, two-thirds of a mile long and set two feet above the local flood stage, its purpose being to help regulate the flow of extremely high waters. The low sill
, as the one we stood on was frequently called, was the prime valve at Old River, and dealt with the water every day. The fate of the project had depended on the low sill, and it was what people meant when, as they often did, they simply said \'93
the structure.\'94 The structure and the high sill\emdash like the navigation lock downstream\emdash were filled into the Mississippi\rquote 
s mainline levee. Beyond the sound of the water, the broad low country around these structures was quiet and truly still. Here and again in the fields, pump jacks bobbed for oil. In the river batcher\emdash the silt-swept no man\rquote 
s land between waterline and levee\emdash lone egrets sat in trees, waiting for the next cow.
\par Dugie remarked that he would soon retire, that he felt old and worn down from fighting the river.
\par I said to him, \'93All you need is a good flood.\'94
\par And he said, \'93Oh, no. Don\rquote t talk like that, man. You talk vulgar.\'94
\par It was odd to look out toward the main-stem Mississippi, scarcely half a mile away, and see its contents spilling sideways, like cornmeal pour
ing from a hole in a burlap bag. Dugie said that so much water coming out of the Mississippi created a powerful and deceptive draw, something like a vacuum, that could suck in boats of any size. He had seen some big ones up against the structure. In the m
id-sixties, a man alone had come down from Wisconsin in a small double-ended vessel with curling ends and tumblehome\emdash a craft that would not have been unfamiliar to the Algonquians, who named the Mississippi. Dugie called this boat \'93a pirogue.
\'94 Whatever it w
as, the man had paddled it all the way from Wisconsin, intent on reaching New Orleans When he had nearly conquered the Mississippi, however, he was captured by the Atchafalaya. Old River caught him, pulled him off the Mississippi, and shot him through the
 structure. \'93He was in shock, but he lived,\'94 Dugie said. \'93We put him in the hospital in Natchez.\'94
\par After a moment, I said, \'93This is an exciting place.\'94
\par And Dugie said, \'93You\rquote ve heard of Murphy\emdash \lquote What can happen will happen\rquote ? This is where Murphy lives.\'94
\par A towb
oat coming up the Atchafalaya may be running from Corpus Christi to Vicksburg with a cargo of gasoline, or from Houston to St. Paul with ethylene glycol. Occasionally, Rabalais sees a sailboat, more rarely a canoe. One time, a cottonwood-log dugout with a
 
high Viking bow went past Old River. A ship carrying Leif Eriksson himself, however, would be less likely to arrest the undivided attention of the lockmaster than a certain red-trimmed cream-hulled vessel called Mississippi, bearing Major General Thomas S
ands.
\par Each year, in late summer or early fall, the Mississippi comes down its eponymous river and noses into the lock. This is the Low-Water Inspection Trip, when the General makes a journey from St. Louis and into the Atchafalaya, stopping along the way at
 river towns, picking up visitors, listening to complaints. In external configuration, the Mississippi is a regular towboat\emdash two hundred and seventeen feet long, fifty feet wide, its horsepower approaching four thousand. The term \'93towboat\'94
 is a misnomer, fo
r the river towboats all push their assembled barges and are therefore designed with broad flat bows. Their unpleasant profiles seem precarious, as if they were the rear halves of ships that have been cut in two. The Mississippi triumphs over these disadv
a
ntages. Intended as a carrier of influenceable people, it makes up in luxury what it suffers in form. Only its red trim is martial. Its over-all bright cream suggests globules that have risen to the top. Its broad flat front is a wall of picture windows, 
of riverine panoramas, faced with cream-colored couches among coffee tables and standing lamps. A river towboat will push as many as fifty barges at one time. What this boat pushes is the program of the Corps.
\par The Mississippi, on its fall trip, is the site 
of on-board hearings at Cape Girardeau, Memphis, Vicksburg, and, ultimately, Morgan City. Customarily, it arrives at Old River early in the morning. Before the boat goes through the lock, people with names like Broussard, Brignac, Begnaud, Blanchard, June
au, Gautreau, Caillouet, and Smith get on\emdash 
people from the Atchafalaya Basin Levee Board, the East Jefferson Levee Board, the Pontchartrain Levee Board, the Louisiana Office of Public Works, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Teche-Vermilion Fr
esh Water District. Oliver Houck, the Tulane professor, gets on, and nine people\emdash seven civilians and two colonels\emdash from the New Orleans District of the Corps of Engineers. \'93This is the ultimate in communications,\'94
 says the enthusiastic General Sands as he greets his colleagues and guests. The gates close behind the Mississippi. The mooring bits inside the lock wail like coyotes as the water and the boat go down.
\par The pilothouse of the Mississippi is a wide handsome room directly above the lounge and similarly fronted with a wall of windows. It has map-and-chart tables, consoles of electronic equipment, redundant radars. The pilots stand front and center, as trim a
nd trig as pilots of the air\emdash John Dugger, from Collierville, Tennessee (the ship\rquote s home port is Memphis), and Jorge Cano, a local \'93contact pilot,\'94
 who is here to help the regular pilots sense the shoals of the Atchafalaya. Among the mutating profiles of the river, their work is complicated. Mark Twain wrote of river pilots, \'93
Two things seemed pretty apparent to me. One was, that in order to be a pilot a man had got to learn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other was, that he must le
arn it all over again in a different way every twenty-four hours. . . .Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but the river, and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride of kings.\'94
 Cano, for his part, is somewhat less flattering on the subject of Twain. He says it baffles him that Twain has \'93such a big reputation for someone who spent so little time on the river.\'94
 Today, the Atchafalaya waters are twelve feet lower than the Mississippi\rquote s. Cano says that the difference is often as much 
as twenty. Now the gates slowly open, revealing the outflow channel that leads into old Old River and soon to the Atchafalaya.
\par The Mississippi River Commission, which is part civilian and part military, with General Sands as president, is required by statute to make these trips\emdash 
to inspect the flood-control and navigation systems from Illinois to the Gulf, and to hold the hearings. Accordingly, there are two major generals and one brigadier aboard, several colonels, various majors\emdash in all, a military concentr
ation that is actually untypical of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps consists essentially of civilians, with a veneer of military people at and near the top. For example, Sands has with him his chief executive assistant, his chief engineer, his
 chief planner, his chief of operations, and his chief of programming. All these chiefs are civilians. Sands is commander of the Corps\rquote 
 Lower Mississippi Valley Division, which the New Orleans District, which includes Old River, is a part. The New Orleans District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, consists of something like ten Army officers and fourteen hundred civilians.
\par Just why the Army should be involved at all with levee systems, navigation locks, rock jetties, concrete revetments, and the austere realiti
es of deltaic geomorphology is a question that attracts no obvious answer. The Corps is here because it is here. Its presence is an expression not of contemporary military strategy but of pure evolutionary tradition, its depth of origin about a century an
d
 three-quarters. The Corps is here specifically to safeguard the nation against any repetition of the War of 1812. When that unusual year was in its thirty-sixth month, the British Army landed on the Gulf Coast and marched against New Orleans. The war had
 been promoted, not to say provoked, by territorially aggressive American Midwesterners who were known around the country as hawks. It had so far produced some invigorating American moments (\'93We have met the enemy and they are ours\'94
), including significant 
naval victories by ships like the Hornet and the Wasp. By and large, though, the triumphs had been British. The British had repelled numerous assaults on Canada. They had established a base in Maine. In Washington, they had burned the Capitol and the Whit
e
 House, and with their rutilant rockets and airburst ballistics they tried to destroy Baltimore. New Orleans was not unaware of these events, and very much dreaded invasion. When it came, militarily untrained American backwoods sharpshooters, standing beh
ind things like cotton bales, picked off two thousand soldiers of the King while losing seventy-one of their own. Nonetheless, the city\rquote s fear of invasion long outlasted the war.
\par Despite the Treaty of Ghent, there was a widespread assumption that the Britis
h would attack again and, if so, would surely attack where they had attacked before. One did not have to go to the War College to learn that lightning enjoys a second chance. Fortifications were therefore required in the environs of New Orleans. That this
 was an assignment for the Army Corps of Engineers was obvious in more than a military sense. There was\emdash and for another decade would be\emdash 
only one school of engineering in America. This was the United States Military Academy, at West Point, New York. The acad
emy had been founded in 1802. The beginnings of the Army Corps of Engineers actually date to the American Revolution. General Washington, finding among his aroused colonists few engineers worthy of the word, hired engineers from Louis XVI, and the first C
orps was for the most part French.
\par The Army engineers chose half a dozen sites near New Orleans and, setting a pattern, signed up a civilian contractor to build the fortifications. Congress also instructed the Army to survey the Mississippi and its tributar
ies with an eye to assuring and improving inland navigation. Thus the Corps spread northward from its military fortifications into civil works along the rivers. In the eighteen-forties and fifties, many of these projects were advanced under the supervisio
n of Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, West Point \rquote 
38, a native of St. Bernard Parish, and ranking military engineer in the district. Late in 1860, Beauregard was named superintendent of the United States Military Academy. He served five days, resigned to 
become a Confederate general, and opened the Civil War by directing the bombardment of Fort Sumter.
\par So much for why there are military officers on the towboat Mississippi inspecting the flood controls of Louisiana\rquote s delta plain. Thomas Sands with his two stars, his warm smile, his intuitive sense of people, and his knowledge of hydrology\emdash 
is Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard\rquote s apostolic successor. Sands is trim, athletic, and, in appearance, youthful. Only in his Vietnam ribbons does he show the effects of h
is assignments as a combat engineer. One of his thumbs is larger and less straight than the other, but that is nothing more than an orthopedic reference to the rigors of plebe lacrosse\emdash West Point \rquote 
58. He grew up near Nashville, and has an advanced degree i
n hydrology from Texas A. & M. and a law degree he earned at night while working in the Pentagon. As a colonel, he spent three years in charge of the New Orleans District. As a brigadier general, he was commander of the Corps\rquote 
 North Atlantic Division, cove
ring military and civil works from Maine to Virginia. Now, from his division headquarters, in Vicksburg, he is in charge of the Mississippi Valley from Missouri to the Gulf. On a wall of his private office is a board of green slate. One day when I was int
erviewing him there, he spent much of the time making and erasing chalk diagrams. \'93Man against nature. That\rquote s what life\rquote s all about,\'94
 he said as he sketched the concatenating forces at Old River and the controls the Corps had applied. He used only the middle third of the slate. The rest had been preempted. The words \lquote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Be Innovative, Be Responsive, and Operate with a Touch of Class}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 \'94 were chalked across the bottom. \'93
Old River is a true representation of a confrontation with nature,\'94 he went on. \'93Folks recognized that Mother Nature, being what she is\emdash having changed course many times\emdash 
would do it again. Today, Mother Nature is working within a constrained environment in the lower Mississippi. Old River is the key element. Every facet of law below there relates to w
hat goes on in this little out-of-the-way point that most folks have never heard about.\'94 Chalked across the upper third of the state were the words \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Do What\rquote 
s Right, and Be Prepared to Fight as Infantry When Required}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 !!!\'94
\par Now, aboard the towboat Mississippi, the General is saying, \'93In terms of hydrology, what we\rquote 
ve done here at Old River is stop time. We have, in effect, stopped time in terms of the distribution of flows. Man is directing the maturing process of the Atchafalaya and the lower Mississippi.\'94 Th
ere is nothing formal about these remarks. The General says that this journey downriver is meant to be \'93a floating convention.\'94
 Listening to him is not a requirement. From the pilothouse to the fantail, people wander where they please, stopping here and again to converse in small groups.
\par Two floatplanes appear above the trees, descend, flare, and land side by side behind the Mississippi. The towboat reduces power, and the airplanes taxi into its wake. They carry four passengers from Morgan City\emdash latecomers t
o the floating convention. They climb aboard, and the airplanes fly away. These four, making such effort to advance their special interests, are four among two million nine hundred thousand people whose livelihoods, safety, health, and quality of life are
 directly influenced by the Corps\rquote 
 controls at Old River. In years gone by, when there were no control structures, naturally there were no complaints. The water went where it pleased. People took it as it came. The delta was in a state of nature. But now th
at Old River is valved and metered there are two million nine hundred thousand potential complainers, very few of whom are reluctant to present a grievance to the Corps. When farmers want less water, for example, fishermen want more, and they all complain
 to the Corps. In General Sands\rquote  words, \'93We\rquote re always walkin\rquote  around with, by and large, the black hat on. There\rquote s no place in the U.S. where there are so many competing interests relating to one water resource.\'94
\par Aboard the Mississippi, this is the primary theme. Oliver Houck, professor of ecoprudence, is heard to mutter, \'93What the Corps does with the water decides everything.\'94
 And General Sands cheerfully remarks that every time he makes one of these trips he gets \'93beaten on the head and shoulders.\'94 He continues, \'93
In most water-resources stories, you can identify two sides. Here there are many more. The crawfisherman and the shrimper come up within five minutes asking for opposite things. The crawfishermen say, \lquote Put more water in, the water is low.\rquote 
 Shrimpers don\rquote t want more water. They are benefitted by low water. Navigation interests say, \lquote The water is too low, don\rquote t take more away or you\rquote ll have to dredge.\rquote  Municipal interests say, \lquote 
Keep the water high or you\rquote ll increase saltwater intrusion.\rquote  In the high-water season, everybody is interested in less water. As the water starts dropping, upstream farmers say, \lquote Get the water off of us quicker.\rquote 
 But folks downstream don\rquote t want it quicker. As water levels go up, we divert some fresh water into marshes, because t
he marshes need it for the nutrients and the sedimentation, but oyster fishermen complain. They all complain except the ones who have seed-oyster beds, which are destroyed by excessive salinity. The variety of competing influences is phenomenal.\'94

\par In southe
rn Louisiana, the bed of the Mississippi River is so far below sea level that a flow of at least a hundred and twenty thousand cubic feet per second is needed to hold back salt water and keep it below New Orleans, which drinks the river. Along the ragged 
edges of the Gulf, whole ecosystems depend on the relationship of fresh to salt water, which is in large part controlled by the Corps. Shrimp people want water to be brackish, waterfowl people want it fresh\emdash 
a situation that causes National Marine Fisheries 
to do battle with United States Fish and Wildlife while both simultaneously attack the Corps. The industrial interests of the American Ruhr beseech the Corps to maintain their supply of fresh water. Agricultural pumping stations demand more fresh water fo
r their rice but nervily ask the Corps to keep the sediment. Morgan City needs water to get oil boats and barges to rigs offshore, but if Morgan City gets too much water it\rquote 
s the end of Morgan City. Port authorities present special needs, and the owners of grain elevators, and the owners of coal elevators, barge interests, flood-control districts, levee boards. As General Sands says, finishing the list, \'93
A guy who wants to put a new dock in has to come to us.\'94 People suspect the Corps of favoring other peopl
e. In addition to all the things the Corps actually does and does not do, there are infinite actions it is imagined to do, infinite actions it is imagined not to do, and infinite actions it is imagined to be capable of doing, because the Corps has been co
nceded the almighty role of God.
\par The towboat enters the Atchafalaya at an unprepossessing T in a jungle of phreatophytic Trees. Atchafalaya. The \'93a\'94s are broad, the word rhymes with \'93jambalaya,\'94 and the accents are on the second and fourth syllables. Among 
navigable rivers, the Atchafalaya is widely described as one of the most treacherous in the world, but it just lies there quiet and smooth. It lies there like a big alligator in a low slough, with time on its side, waiting\emdash 
waiting to outwit the Corps of Engineers\emdash 
and hunkering down ever lower in its bed and presenting a sort of maw to the Mississippi, into which the river could fall. In the pilothouse, standing behind Jorge Cano and John Dugger as they swing the ship to port and head south, I find myself re
membering an exchange between Cano and Rabalais a couple of days ago, when Cano was speculating about the Atchafalaya\rquote s chances of capturing the Mississippi someday despite all efforts to prevent it from doing so. \'93Mother Nature is patient,\'94
 he said. \'93Mother Nature has more time than we do.\'94
\par Rabalais said, \'93She has nothing but time.\'94
\par Frederic Chatry happens to be in the pilothouse, too, as does Fred Bayley. Both are civilians: Chatry, chief engineer of the New Orleans District; Bayley, chief engineer of the
 Lower Mississippi Valley Division. Chatry is short and slender, a courtly and formal man, his uniform a bow tie. He is saying that before the control structures were built water used to flow in either direction through Old River. It would flow into the M
ississippi if the Red happened to be higher. This was known as a reversal, and the last reversal occurred in 1945. The enlarging Atchafalaya was by then so powerful in its draw that it took all of the Red and kept it. \'93
The more water the Atchafalaya takes, 
the bigger it gets; the bigger it gets, the more water it takes. The only thing that interrupts it is Old River Control. If we had not interrupted it, the main river would now be the Atchafalaya, below this point. If you left it to its own devices, the en
d
 result had to be that it would become the master stream. If that were to happen, below Old River the Mississippi reach would be unstable. Salt would fill it in. The Corps could not cope with it. Old River to Baton Rouge would fill in. River traffic from 
the north would stop. Everything would go to pot in the delta. We couldn\rquote t cope. It would be plugged.\'94
\par I ask to what extent they ever contemplate that the structures at Old River might fail.
\par Bayley is quick to answer\emdash Fred Bayley, a handsome sandy-haired man in a regimental tie and a cool tan suit, with the contemplative manner of an academic and none of the defenses of a challenged engineer. \'93Anything can fail,\'94 he says. \'93
In most of our projects, we try to train natural effects instead of taking them head on. I never approach anything we do with the idea that it can\rquote t fail. That is sticking your head in the sand.\'94
\par We are making twelve knots on a two-and-a-half-knot current under bright sun and cottony bits of cloud\emdash flying along between the Atchafalaya levees,
 between the river-batcher trees. We are running down the reach above Simmesport, but only a distant bridge attests to that fact. From the river you cannot see the country. From the country you cannot see the river. I once looked down at this country from
 the air, in a light plane, and although it is called a floodway\emdash this segment of it the West Atchafalaya Floodway\emdash 
it is full of agriculture, in plowed geometries of brown, green, and tan. The Atchafalaya from above looks like the Connecticut winding past Ne
w Hampshire floodplain farms. If you look up, you do not see Mt. Washington. You see artificial ponds, now and again, as far as the horizon\emdash 
square ponds, dotted with the cages of crawfish. You see dark-green pastureland, rail fences, cows with short fat shadows.
\par The unexpected happens\emdash 
unthinkable, unfortunate, but not unimaginable. At first with a modest lurch, and then with a more pronounced lurch, and then with a profound structural shudder, the Mississippi is captured by the Atchafalaya. The mid-American
 flagship of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has run aground.
\par After going on line, in 1963, the control structures at Old River had to wait ten years to prove what they could do. The nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties were secure in the Mississippi Val
ley. In human terms, a generation passed with no disastrous floods. The Mississippi River and Tributaries Project\emdash the Corps\rquote  total repertory of defenses from Cairo, Illinois, southward\emdash 
seemed to have met its design purpose: to confine and conduct the run o
f the river, to see it safely into the Gulf. The Corps looked upon this accomplishment with understandable pride and, without intended diminution of respect for its enemy, issued a statement of victory: \'93
We harnessed it, straightened it, regularized it, shackled it.\'94
\par Then, in the fall of 1972, the winter of 1973, river stages were higher than normal, reducing the system\rquote s tolerance for what might come in spring. In the upper valley, snows were unusually heavy. In the South came a season of exceptional rains
. During the uneventful era that was about to end, the Mississippi\rquote 
s main channel, in its relative lethargy, had given up a lot of volume to accumulations of sediment. High water, therefore, would flow that much higher. As the spring runoff came down the t
ributaries, collected, and approached, computers gave warning that the mainline levees were not sufficient to contain it. Eight hundred miles of frantically filled sandbags were added to the levees. Bulldozers added potato ridges\emdash 
barriers of uncompacted dirt. While this was going on, more rain was falling. In the southern part of the valley, twenty inches fell in a day and a half.
\par At Old River Control on an ordinary day, when the stilling basin sounds like Victoria Falls but otherwise the country is calm and dry\emdash when sandy spaces and stands of trees fill up the view between the structure and the Mississippi\emdash 
an almost academic effort is required to visualize a slab of water six stories high, spread to the ends of perspective. That is how it was in 1973. During the sustained spring high water\emdash week after week after week\emdash 
the gathered drainage of Middle America came to Old River in units exceeding two million cubic feet a second. Twenty-five per cent of that left the Mississippi channel and went to the Atchafalaya
. In aerial view, trees and fields were no longer visible, and the gated stronghold of the Corps seemed vulnerable in the extreme\emdash a narrow causeway, a thin fragile line across a brown sea.
\par The Corps had built Old River Control to control just about as much as was passing through it. In mid-March, when the volume began to approach that amount, curiosity got the best of Raphael G. Kazmann, author of a book called \'93Modern Hydrology\'94
 and professor of civil engineering at Louisiana State University. Kazmann got 
into his car, crossed the Mississippi on the high bridge at Baton Rouge, and made his way north to Old River. He parked, got out, and began to walk the structure. An extremely low percentage of its five hundred and sixty-six feet eradicated his curiosity.
 \'93That whole miserable structure was vibrating,\'94 he recalled in 1986, adding that he had felt as if he were standing on a platform at a small rural train station when \'93a fully loaded freight goes through.\'94
 Kazmann opted not to wait for the caboose. \'93I thoug
ht, This thing weighs two hundred thousand tons. When two hundred thousand tons vibrates like this, this is no place for R. G. Kazmann. I got into my car, turned around, and got the hell out of there. I was just a professor\emdash 
and, thank God, not responsible.\'94
\par Kazmann says that the Tennessee River and the Missouri River were \'93the two main culprits\'94
 in the 1973 flood. In one high water and another, the big contributors vary around the watershed. An ultimate deluge might possibly involve them all. After Kazmann 
went home from Old River that time in 1973, he did his potamology indoors for a while, assembling daily figures. In some of the numbers he felt severe vibrations. In his words, \'93
I watched the Ohio like a hawk, because if that had come up, I thought, Katie, bar the door!\'94
\par The water was plenty high as it was, and continuously raged through the structure. Nowhere in the Mississippi Valley were velocities greater than in this one place, where the waters made their hydraulic jump, plunging over what Kazmann describes as \'93
concrete falls\'94 into the regime of the Atchafalaya. The structure and its stilling basin had been configured to dissipate energy\emdash but not nearly so much energy. The excess force was attacking the environment of the structure. A large eddy had for
m
ed. Unbeknownst to anyone, its swirling power was excavating sediments by the inflow apron of the structure. Even larger holes had formed under the apron itself. Unfortunately, the main force of the Mississippi was crashing against the south side of the i
nflow channel, producing unplanned turbulence. The control structure had been set up near the outside of a bend of the river, and closer to the Mississippi than many engineers thought wise.
\par On the outflow side\emdash where the water fell to the level of the Atchafalaya\emdash 
a hole had developed that was larger and deeper than a football stadium, and with much the same shape. It was hidden, of course, far beneath the chop of wild water. The Corps had long since been compelled to leave all eleven gates wide open, in order
 to reduce to the greatest extent possible the force that was shaking the structure, and so there was no alternative to aggravating the effects on the bed of the channel. In addition to the structure\rquote 
s weight, what was holding it in place was a millipede of stilts\emdash 
steel H-beams that reached down at various angles, as pilings, ninety feet through sands and silts, through clayey peats and organic mucks. There never was a question of anchoring such a fortress in rock. The shallowest rock was seven thousand fee
t straight down. In three places below the structure, sheet steel went into the substrate like fins; but the integrity of the structure depended essentially on the H-beams, and vehicular traffic continued to cross it en route to San Luis Rey.
\par Then, as now, LeRoy Dugas was the person whose hand controlled Old River Control\emdash a thought that makes him smile. \'93We couldn\rquote t afford to close any of the gates,\'94 he remarked to me one day at Old River. \'93
Too much water was passing through the structure. Water picked up riprap off the bottom in front, and rammed it through to the tail bed.\'94
 The riprap included derrick stones, and each stone weighed seven tons. On the level of the road deck, the vibrations increased. The operator of a moving crane let the crane move without him and waited for it at the end of the structure. Dugie continued, 
\'93You could get on the structure with your automobile and open the door and it would close the door.\'94 The crisis recalled the magnitude of \'93the \rquote 27 high water,\'94 when Dugie was a baby. Up the valley somewhere, during the \rquote 
27 high water, was a railroad bridge with a train sitting on it loaded with coal. The train had been put there because its weight might help keep the bridge in place, but the bridge, vibrating in the floodwater, produced so
 much friction that the coal in the gondolas caught fire. Soon the bridge, the train, and the glowing coal fell into the water.
\par One April evening in 1973\emdash at the height of the flood\emdash a fisherman walked onto the structure. There is, after all, order in the un
iverse, and some things take precedence over impending disasters. On the inflow side, facing the Mississippi, the structure was bracketed by a pair of guide walls that reached out like curving arms to bring in the water. Close by the guide wall at the sou
th end was the swirling eddy, which by now had become a whirlpool. There was other motion as well\emdash 
or so it seemed. The fisherman went to find Dugas, in his command post at the north end of the structure, and told him the guide wall had moved. Dugie told the fisherman he was seeing things. The fisherman nodded affirmatively.
\par When Dugie himself went to look at the guide wall, he looked at it for the last time. \'93It was slipping into the river, into the inflow channel.\'94 Slowly it dipped, sank, broke. Its foundat
ions were gone. There was nothing below it but water. Professor Kazmann likes to say that this was when the Corps became \'93scared green.\'94
 Whatever the engineers may have felt, as soon as the water began to recede they set about learning the dimensions of th
e damage. The structure was obviously undermined, but how much so, and where? What was solid, what was not? What was directly below the gates and the roadway? With a diamond drill, in a central position, they bored the first of many holes in the structure
. When they had penetrated to basal levels, they lowered a television camera into the hole. They saw fish.
\par This was scarcely the first time that an attempt to control the Mississippi had failed. Old River, 1973, was merely the most emblematic place and mome
nt where, in the course of three centuries, failure had occurred. From the beginnings of settlement, failure was the par expectation with respect to the river\emdash 
a fact generally masked by the powerful fabric of ambition that impelled people to build towns and cities where almost any camper would be loath to pitch a tent.
\par If you travel by canoe through the river swamps of Louisiana, you may very well grow uneasy as the sun is going down. You look around for a site\emdash a place to sleep, a place to cook. There is no
 terra firma. Nothing is solider than duckweed, resting on the water like green burlap. Quietly, you slide through the forest, breaking out now and again into acreages of open lake. You study the dusk for some dark cap of uncovered ground. Seeing one at l
a
st, you occupy it, limited though it may be. Your tent site may be smaller than your tent, but in this amphibious milieu you have found yourself terrain. You have established yourself in much the same manner that the French established New Orleans. So wha
t does it matter if your leg spends the night in the water.
\par The water is from the state of New York, the state of Idaho, the province of Alberta, and everywhere below that frame. Far above Old River are places where the floodplain
 is more than a hundred miles wide. Spaniards in the sixteenth century came upon it at the wrong time, saw an ocean moving south, and may have been discouraged. Where the delta began, at Old River, the water spread out even more\emdash 
through a palimpsest of bayous and distributary streams in forested paludal basins\emdash 
but this did not dissuade the French. For military and commercial purposes, they wanted a city in such country. They laid it out in 1718, only months before a great flood. Even as New Orleans was risi
ng, its foundations filled with water. The message in the landscape could not have been more clear: like the aboriginal people, you could fish and forage and move on, but you could not build there\emdash 
you could not create a city, or even a cluster of modest steadings\emdash 
without declaring war on nature. You did not have to be Dutch to understand this, or French to ignore it. The people of southern Louisiana have often been compared unfavorably with farmers of the pre-Aswan Nile, who lived on high ground, farmed low
 ground, and permitted floods to come and go according to the rhythms of nature. There were differences in Louisiana, though. There was no high ground worth mentioning, and planters had to live on their plantations. The waters of the Nile were warm; the M
ississippi brought cold northern floods that sometimes stood for months, defeating agriculture for the year. If people were to farm successfully in the rich loams of the natural levees\emdash or anywhere nearby\emdash 
they could not allow the Mississippi to continue in its natural state. Herbert Kassner, the division\rquote s public-relations director, once remarked to me, \'93
This river used to meander all over its floodplain. People would move their tepees, and that was that. You can\rquote t move Vicksburg.\'94
\par When rivers go over their b
anks, the spreading water immediately slows up, dropping the heavier sediments. The finer the silt, the farther it is scattered, but so much falls close to the river that natural levees rise through time. The first houses of New Orleans were built on the 
n
atural levees, overlooking the river. In the face of disaster, there was no better place to go. If there was to be a New Orleans, the levees themselves would have to be raised, and the owners of the houses were ordered to do the raising. This law (1724) w
a
s about as effective as the ordinances that compel homeowners and shopkeepers in the North to shovel snow off their sidewalks. Odd as it seems now, those early levees were only three feet high, and they were rife with imperfections. To the extent that the
y
 were effective at all, they owed a great deal to the country across the river, where there were no artificial levees, and waters that went over the bank flowed to the horizon. In 1727, the French colonial governor declared the New Orleans levee complete,
 adding that within a year it would be extended a number of miles up and down the river, making the community floodproof. The governor\rquote s name was Perrier. If words could stop water, Perrier had found them\emdash initiating a durable genre.
\par In 1735, New Orleans went under\emdash and again in 1785. The intervals\emdash like those between earthquakes in San Francisco\emdash 
were generally long enough to allow the people to build up a false sense of security. In response to the major floods, they extended and raised the levees. A levee app
eared across the river from New Orleans, and by 1812 the west bank was leveed to the vicinity of Old River, a couple of hundred miles upstream. At that time, the east bank was leveed as far as Baton Rouge. Neither of the levees was continuous. Both protec
ted plantation land. Where the country remained as the Choctaws had known it, floodwaters poured to the side, reducing the threat elsewhere. Land was not cheap\emdash forty acres cost three thousand dollars\emdash 
but so great was the demand for riverfront plantations that by 1828 the levees in southern Louisiana were continuous, the river artificially confined. Just in case the levees should fail, some plantation houses\emdash 
among their fields of sugarcane, their long bright rows of oranges\emdash were built on Indian burial mounds. In 1828, Bayou Manchac was closed. In the whole of the Mississippi\rquote 
s delta plain, Bayou Manchac happened to have been the only distributary that went east. It was dammed at the source. Its discharge would no longer ease the pressures of the master stream.
\par By this time, Henry Shreve had appeared on the scene\emdash 
in various ways to change it forever. He was the consummate riverman: boatman, pilot, entrepreneur, empirical naval architect. He is noted as the creator of the flat-hulled layer-cake stern-wheel Missis
sippi steamboat, its shallow draft result of moving the machinery up from below to occupy its own deck. The Mississippi steamboat was not invented, however. It evolved. And Shreve\rquote 
s contribution was less in its configuration than its power. A steamboat bui
lt and piloted by Henry Shreve travelled north against the current as far as Louisville. He demonstrated that commerce could go both ways. Navigation was inconvenienced, though, by hazards in the river\emdash 
the worst of which were huge trees that had drifted so
uth over the years and become stuck in various ways. One kind was rigid in the riverbed and stood up like a spear. It was called a planter. Another, known as a sawyer sawed up and down with the vagaries of the current, and was likely to rise suddenly in t
he path of a boat and destroy it. In the Yukon River, such logs\emdash eternally bowing\emdash are known as preachers. In the Mississippi, whatever the arrested logs were called individually, they were all \'93snags,\'94
 and after the Army engineers had made Shreve, a civilian
, their Superintendent of Western River Improvements he went around like a dentist yanking snags. The multihulled snag boats were devices of his invention. In the Red River, he undertook to disassemble a \'93raft\'94\emdash 
uprooted trees by the tens of thousands that 
were stopping navigation for a hundred and sixty miles. Shreve cleared eighty miles in one year. Meanwhile, at 31 degrees north latitude (about halfway between Vicksburg and Baton Rouge) he made a bold move on the Mississippi. In the sinusoidal path of th
e
 river, any meander tended to grow until its loop was so large it would cut itself off. At 31 degrees north latitude was a west-bending loop that was eighteen miles around and had so nearly doubled back upon itself that Shreve decided to help it out. He a
dapted one of his snag boats as a dredge, and after two weeks of digging across the narrow neck he had a good swift current flowing. The Mississippi quickly took over. The width of Shreve\rquote 
s new channel doubled in two days. A few days more and it had become the main channel of the river.
\par The great loop at 31 degrees north happened to he where the Red-Atchafalaya conjoined the Mississippi, like a pair of parentheses back to back. Steamboats had had difficulty there in the colliding waters. Shreve\rquote s purpose in 
cutting off the loop was to give the boats a smoother shorter way to go, and, as an incidental, to speed up the Mississippi, lowering, however slightly, its crests in flood. One effect of the cutoff was to increase the flow of water out of the Mississippi
 
and into the Atchafalaya, advancing the date of ultimate capture. Where the flow departed from the Mississippi now, it followed an arm of the cutoff meander. This short body of water soon became known as Old River. In less than a fortnight, it had been re
moved as a segment of the main-stem Mississippi and restyled as a form of surgical drain.
\par In city and country, riverfront owners became sensitive about the fact that the levees they were obliged to build were protecting not only their properties but also the properties behind them. Levee districts were established\emdash 
administered by levee boards\emdash to spread the cost. The more the levees confined the river, the more destructive it became when they failed. A place where water broke through was known as a crevasse\emdash a
 source of terror no less effective than a bursting dam\emdash and the big ones were memorialized, like other great disasters, in a series of proper names: the Macarty Crevasse (1816), the Sauv\'e9
 Crevasse (1849). Levee inspectors were given power to call out male slaves\emdash aged fifteen to sixty\emdash whose owners lived within seven miles of trouble. With the approach of mid-century, the levees were averaging six feet\emdash 
twice their original height\emdash and calculations indicated that the flow line would rise. Most levee districts w
ere not populous enough to cover the multiplying costs, so the United States Congress, in 1850, wrote the swamp and Overflow Land Act. It is possible that no friend of Peter had ever been so generous in handing over his money to Paul. The federal governme
n
t deeded millions of acres of swampland to states along the river, and the states sold the acreage to pay for the levees. The Swamp Act gave eight and a half million acres of river swamps and marshes to Louisiana alone. Other states, in aggregate, got twe
n
ty million more. Since time immemorial, these river swamps had been the natural reservoirs where floodwaters were taken in and held, and gradually released as the flood went down. Where there was timber (including virgin cypress), the swampland was sold f
o
r seventy-five cents an acre, twelve and a half cents where there were no trees. The new owners were for the most part absentee. An absentee was a Yankee. The new owners drained much of the swampland, turned it into farmland, and demanded the protection o
f new and larger levees. At this point, Congress might have asked itself which was the act and which was the swamp.
\par River stages, in their wide variations, became generally higher through time, as the water was presented with fewer outlets. People began to 
wonder if the levees could ever be high enough and strong enough to make the river safe. Possibly a system of dams and reservoirs in the tributaries of the upper valley could hold water back and release it in the drier months, and possibly a system of spi
l
lways and floodways could be fashioned in the lower valley to distribute water when big floods arrived. Beginning in the eighteen-fifties, these notions were the subject of virulent debate among civilian and military engineers. Four major floods in ten ye
a
rs and thirty-two disastrous crevasses in a single spring were not enough to suggest to the Corps that levees alone might never be equal to the job. The Corps, as things stood, was not yet in charge. District by district, state by state, the levee system 
was still a patchwork effort. There was no high command in the fight against the water. In one of the Corps\rquote  official histories, the situation is expressed in this rather preoccupied sentence: \'93
By 1860, it had become increasingly obvious that a successful war over such an immense battleground could be waged only by a consolidated army under one authority.\'94
 While the Civil War came and went, the posture of the river did not change. Vicksburg fell but did not move. In the floods of 1862, 1866, and 1867, levees failed. Catastrophes notwithstanding, Bayou Plaquemine\emdash 
a major distributary of the Mississippi and a natural escape for large percentages of spring high water\emdash was closed in 1868, its junction with the Mississippi sealed by an earthen dam. Even at normal s
tages, the Mississippi was beginning to stand up like a large vein on the back of a hand. The river of the eighteen-seventies ran higher than it ever had before.
\par In 1879, Congress at last created the Mississippi River Commission, which included civilians b
ut granted hegemony to the Corps. The president of the commission would always be an Army engineer, and all decisions were subject to veto by the commandant of the Corps. Imperiously, Congress ordered the commission to \'93prevent destructive floods,\'94
 and left it to the Corps to say how. The Corps remained committed to the argument that tributary dams and reservoirs and downstream spillways would create more problems than they would solve. \'93Hold by levees\'94 was the way to do the job.
\par The national importance of 
the commission is perhaps illuminated by the fact that one of its first civilian members was Benjamin Harrison. Another was James B. Eads, probably the most brilliant engineer who has ever addressed his attention to the Mississippi River. As a young man, 
h
e had walked around on its bottom under a device of his own invention that he called a submarine. As a naval architect in the Civil War, he had designed the first American ironclads. Later, at St. Louis, he had built the first permanent bridge across the 
m
ain stem of the river south of the Missouri. More recently, in defiance of the cumulative wisdom of nearly everyone in his profession, he had solved a primal question in anadromous navigation: how to get into the river. The mouth was defended by a mud-lum
p blockade\emdash impenetrable masses of sediment dumped by the river as it reached the still waters of the Gulf. Dredging was hopeless. What would make a channel deep enough for ships? The government wouldn\rquote 
t finance him, so Eads bet his own considerable fortune on an elegant idea: he built parallel jetties in the river\rquote s mouth. They pinched the currents. The accelerated water dug out and maintained a navigable channel.
\par To the Corps\rquote  belief that a river confined by levees would similarly look after itself the success of the jetties gave considerable reinforcement. And Eads added words that spoke louder than his actions. \'93
If the profession of an engineer were not based upon exact science,\'94 he said, \'93I might tremble for the result, in view of the immensely of the int
erests dependent on my success. But every atom that moves onward in the river, from the moment it leaves its home among the crystal springs or mountain snows, throughout the fifteen hundred leagues of its devious pathway, until it is finally lost in the v
ast waters of the Gulf, is controlled by laws as fixed and certain as those which direct the majestic march of the heavenly spheres. Every phenomenon and apparent eccentricity of the river\emdash 
its scouring and depositing action, its caving banks, the formation of the bars at its mouth, the effect of the waves and tides of the sea upon its currents and deposits\emdash 
is controlled by law as immutable as the Creator, and the engineer need only to be insured that he does not ignore the existence of any of these laws, to feel positively certain of the results he aims at.\'94
\par When the commission was created, Mark Twain was forty-three. A book he happened to be working on was \'93Life on the Mississippi.\'94 Through a character called Uncle Mumford, he remarked that \'93four years at We
st Point, and plenty of books and schooling, will learn a man a good deal, I reckon, but it won\rquote t learn him the river.\'94 Twain also wrote, \'93One who knows the Mississippi will promptly aver\emdash not aloud but to himself\emdash 
that ten thousand River Commissions, with the mines of the world at their back, cannot tame that lawless stream, cannot curb it or confine it, cannot say to it, \lquote Go here,\rquote  or \lquote Go there,\rquote 
 and make it obey; cannot save a shore which it has sentenced; cannot bar its path with an obstruction which it w
ill not tear down, dance over, and laugh at. But a discreet man will not put these things into spoken words; for the West Point engineers have not their superiors anywhere; they know all that can be known of their abstruse science; and so, since they conc
e
ive that they can fetter and handcuff that river and boss him, it is but wisdom for the unscientific man to keep still, lie low, and wait till they do it. Captain Eads, with his jetties, has done a work at the mouth of the Mississippi which seemed clearly
 
impossible; so we do not feel full confidence now to prophesy against like impossibilities. Otherwise one would pipe out and say the Commission might as well bully the comets in their courses and undertake to make them behave, as try to bully the Mississi
ppi into right and reasonable conduct.\'94
\par In 1882 came the most destructive flood of the nineteenth century. After breaking the levees in two hundred and eighty-four crevasses, the water spread out as much as seventy miles. In the fertile lands on the two sid
es of Old River, plantations were deeply submerged, and livestock survived in flatboats. A floating journalist who reported these scenes in the March 29th New Orleans }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Times-Democrat}
{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352  said, \'93The current running down the Atchafalaya was very swift, the Mississippi showing a predilection in that direction, which needs only to be seen to enforce the opinion of that river
\rquote s desperate endeavors to find a short way to the Gulf.\'94 The capture of the Mississippi, in other words, was already obvious enough to be noticed by a journalist. Seventy-eight years earlier\emdash just after the Louisiana Purchase\emdash 
the Army officer who went to take possession of the new country observed the Atchafalaya \'93completely obstructed by logs and other material\'94 and said in his report, \'93Were it no
t for these obstructions, the probability is that the Mississippi would soon find a much nearer way to the Gulf than at present, particularly as it manifests a constant inclination to vary its course.\'94
 The head of the Atchafalaya was plugged with logs for 
thirty miles. The raft was so compact that El Camino Real, the Spanish trail coming in from Texas, crossed the Atchafalaya near its head, and cattle being driven toward the Mississippi walked across the logs. The logjam was Old River Control Structure No.
 
O. Gradually, it was disassembled, freeing the Atchafalaya to lower its plain. Snag boats worked on it, and an attempt was made to clear it with fire. The flood of 1863 apparently broke it open, and at once the Atchafalaya began to widen and deepen, incre
asing its draw on the Mississippi. Shreve\rquote 
s clearing of the Red River had also increased the flow of the Atchafalaya. The interventional skill of human engineers, which would be called upon in the twentieth century to stop the great shift at Old River, did much in the nineteenth to hurry it up.

\par For forty-eight years, the Mississippi River Commission and the Corps of Engineers adhered strictly to the \'93hold by levees\'94 policy\emdash levees, and levees only. It was important that no water be allowed to escape the river
, because its full power would be most effective in scouring the bed, deepening the channel, increasing velocity, lowering stages, and preventing destructive floods. This was the hydraulic and hydrological philosophy not only of the U.S. Army Corps of Eng
ineers but also of the great seventeenth-century savant Domenico Guglielmini, whose insights, ultimately, were to prove so ineffective in the valley of the Po. In 1885, one of General Sands\rquote  predecessors said, \'93
The commission is distinctly committed to the idea of closing all outlets. . . .It has consistently opposed the fallacy known as the \lquote Outlet System.\rquote \~\'94
\par Slaves with wheelbarrows started the levees. Immigrants with wheelbarrows replaced the slaves. Mule-drawn scrapers replaced the wheelbarrows, but not until the twentieth century. Fifteen hundred miles of earthen walls\emdash 
roughly six, then nine, then twelve feet high, and a hundred feet from side to side\emdash were built by men with shovels. They wove huge mats of willow poles and laid them down in cutbanks as re
vetments. When floods came, they went out to defend their defenses, and, in the words of a Corps publication, the effort was comparable to \'93the rigors of the battlefield.\'94
 Nature was not always the only enemy. Anywhere along the river, people were safer if
 the levee failed across the way. If you lived on the east side, you might not be sad if water flooded west. You were also safer if the levee broke on your own side downstream. Armed patrols went up and down the levees. They watched for sand boils\emdash 
signs of seepage that could open a crevasse from within. And they watched for Private commandos, landing in the dark with dynamite.
\par Bayou Lafourche, a major distributary, was dammed in 1904. In something like twenty years, the increased confinement of the river ha
d elevated floodwaters in Memphis by an average of about eight feet. The Corps remained loyal to the teachings of Guglielmini, and pronouncements were still forthcoming that the river was at last under control and destructive floods would not occur again.
 Declarations of that sort had been made in the quiet times before the great floods of 1884, 1890, 1891, 1897, 1898, and 1903, and they would be made again before 1912, 1913, 1922, and 1927.
\par The \rquote 27 high water tore the valley apart. On both sides of the riv
er, levees crevassed from Cairo to the Gulf, and in the same thousand miles the flood destroyed every bridge. It killed hundreds of people, thousands of animals. Overbank, it covered twenty-six thousand square miles. It stayed on the land as much as three
 months. New Orleans was saved by blowing up a levee downstream. Yet the total volume of the 1927 high water was nowhere near a record. It was not a hundred-year flood. It was a form of explosion, achieved by the confining levees.
\par The levees of the nineteen-twenties were about six times as high as their earliest predecessors, but really no more effective. In a sense, they had been an empirical experiment\emdash in aggregate, fifteen hundred miles of trial and error. They could be
\emdash and they would be\emdash raised even highe
r. But in 1927 the results of the experiment at last came clear. The levees were helping to aggravate the problem they were meant to solve. With walls alone, one could only build an absurdly elevated aqueduct. Resistance times the resistance distance ampl
i
fied the force of nature. Every phenomenon and apparent eccentricity of the river might be subject to laws as fixed and certain as those which direct the majestic march of the heavenly spheres, but, if so, the laws were inexactly understood. The Corps had
 attacked Antaeus without quite knowing who he was.
\par Congress appropriated three hundred million dollars to find out. This was more money in one bill\emdash the hopefully titled Flood Control Act (1928)\emdash than had been spent on Mississippi levees in all of Colonial a
nd American history. These were the start-up funds for the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project, the coordinated defenses that would still be incomplete in the nineteen-eighties and would ultimately cost about seven billion dollars. The project would
 
raise levees and build new ones, pave cutbanks, sever loops to align the current, and hold back large volumes of water with substantial dams in tributary streams. Dredges known as dustpans would take up sediment by the millions of tons. Stone dikes would 
a
ppear in strategic places, forcing the water to go around them, preventing the channel from spreading out. Most significantly, though, the project would acknowledge the superiority of the force with which it was meant to deal. It would give back to the ri
ver some measure of the freedom lost as the delta\rquote 
s distributaries one by one were sealed. It would go into the levees in certain places and build gates that could be opened in times of extraordinary flood. The water coming out of such spillways would enter
 new systems of levees guiding it down floodways to the Gulf. But how many spillways? How many floodways? How many tributary dams? Calculating maximum storms, frequency of storms, maximum snowmelts, sustained saturation of the upper valley, coincident sto
rms in scattered parts of the watershed, the Corps reached for the figure that would float Noah. The round number was three million\emdash 
that is, three million cubic feet per second coming past Old River. This was twenty-five per cent above the 1927 high. The ex
panded control system, with its variety of devices, would have to be designed to process that. Various names were given to this blue-moon superflow, this concatenation of recorded moments written in the future unknown. It was called the Design Flood. Alte
rnatively, it was called the Project Flood.
\par Bonnet Carre was the first spillway\emdash completed in 1931, roughly thirty miles upriver from New Orleans. The water was meant to spill into Lake Pontchartrain and go on into the Gulf, dispersing eight and a half per c
ent of the Project Flood. Bonnet Carre (locally pronounced \'93Bonny Carey\'94) would replace dynamite in the defense of New Orleans. When the great crest of 1937 came down the river\emdash setting an all-time record at Natchez\emdash 
enough of the new improvements were in pl
ace to see it through in relative safety, with the final and supreme test presented at Bonnet Carre, where the gates were opened for the first time. At the high point, more than two hundred thousand feet per second were diverted into Lake Pontchartrain, a
nd the flow that went on by New Orleans left the city low and dry.
\par For the Corps of Engineers, not to mention the people of the southern parishes, the triumph of 1937 brought fresh courage, renewed confidence\emdash a sense once again that the river could be contr
olled. Major General Harley B. Ferguson, the division commander, became a regional military hero. It was he who had advocated the project\rquote 
s many cutoffs, all made in the decade since 1927, which shortened the river by more than a hundred miles, reducing th
e amount of friction working against the water. The more distance, the more friction. Friction slows the river and raises its level. The mainline levees were rebuilt, extended, reinforced\emdash 
and their height was almost doubled, reaching thirty feet. There was
 now a Great Wall of China running up each side of the river, with the difference that while the levees were each about as long as the Great Wall they were in many places higher and in cross-section ten times as large. Work continued on the floodways. The
re was one in Missouri that let water out of the river and put it back into the river a few miles downstream. But the principal conduit of release\emdash without which Bonnet Carre would be about as useful as a bailing can\emdash 
was the route of the Atchafalaya. Since t
he lower part of it was the largest river swamp in North America, it was, by nature, ready for the storage of water. The Corps built guide levees about seventeen miles apart to shape the discharge toward Atchafalaya Bay, incidentally establishing a framew
o
rk for the swamp. In the northern Atchafalaya, near Old River, they built a three-chambered system of floodways involving so many intersecting levees that the country soon resembled a cranberry farm developed on an epic scale. The West Atchafalaya Floodwa
y had so many people in it, and so many soybeans, that its levees were to be breached only by explosives in extreme emergency\emdash 
maybe once in a hundred years. The Morganza Floodway, completed in the nineteen-fifties, contained farmlands but no permanent build
ings. A couple of towns and the odd refinery were surrounded by levees in the form of rings. But the plane geometry of the floodways was primarily intended to take the water from the Mississippi and get it to the swamp.
\par The flood-control design of 1928 had left Old River open\emdash 
the only distributary of the Mississippi to continue in its natural state. The Army was aware of the threat from the Atchafalaya. Colonel Charles Potter, president of the Mississippi River Commission, told Congress in 1928 that the Mississippi was \'93
just itching to go that way.\'94 In the new master plan, however, nothing resulted from his testimony. The Corps, in making its flow diagrams, planned that the Atchafalaya would take nearly half the Mississippi during the Design Flood. It was no
t in the design that the Atchafalaya take it all.
\par The Atchafalaya, continuing to grow, had become, by volume of discharge, the second-largest river in the United States. Compared with the Mississippi, it had a three-to-one advantage in slope. Around 1950, 
geologists predicted that by 1975 the shift would be unstoppable. The Mississippi River and Tributaries Project would be in large part invalidated, the entire levee system of southern Louisiana would have to be rebuilt, communities like Morgan City in the
 Atchafalaya Basin would be a good deal less preserved than Pompeii, and the new mouth of the Mississippi would be a hundred and twenty miles from the old. Old River Control was authorized in 1954.
\par The levees were raised again. What had been adequate in 193
7 was problematical in the nineteen-fifties. New grades were set. New dollars were spent to meet the grades. So often compared with the Great Wall of China, the levees had more in common with the Maginot Line. Taken together, they were a retroactive redou
b
t, more than adequate to wage a bygone war but below the requirements of the war to come. The levee grades of the nineteen-fifties would prove inadequate in the nineteen-seventies. Every shopping center, every drainage improvement, every square foot of ne
w pavement in nearly half the United States was accelerating runoff toward Louisiana. Streams were being channelized to drain swamps. Meanders were cut off to speed up flow. The valley\rquote 
s natural storage capacities were everywhere reduced. As contributing fa
ctors grew, the river delivered more flood for less rain. The precipitation that produced the great flood of 1973 was only about twenty per cent above normal. Yet the crest at St. Louis was the highest ever recorded there. The flood proved that control of
 the Mississippi was as much a hope for the future as control of the Mississippi had ever been. The 1973 high water did not come close to being a Project Flood. It merely came close to wiping out the project.
\par While the control structure at Old River was sha
king, more than a third of the Mississippi was going down the Atchafalaya. If the structure had toppled, the flow would have risen to seventy per cent. It was enough to scare not only a Louisiana State University professor but the division commander himse
lf. At the time, this was Major General Charles Noble. He walked the bridge, looked down into the exploding water, and later wrote these words: \'93
The south training wall on the Mississippi River side of the structure failed very early in the flood, causing v
iolent eddy patterns and extreme turbulence. The toppled training wall monoliths worsened the situation. The integrity of the structure at this point was greatly in doubt. It was frightening to stand above the gate bays and experience the punishing vibrat
ions caused by the violently turbulent, massive flood waters.\'94
\par If the General had known what was below him, he might have sounded retreat. The Old River Control Structure\emdash this two-hundred-thousand-ton keystone of the comprehensive flood-protection project for the lower Mississippi Valley\emdash 
was teetering on steel pilings above extensive cavities full of water. The gates of the Morganza Floodway, thirty miles downstream, had never been opened. The soybean farmers of Morganza were begging the Corps not to open th
em now. The Corps thought it over for a few days while the Old River Control Structure, absorbing shock of the sort that could bring down a skyscraper, continued to shake. Relieving some of the pressure, the Corps opened Morganza.
\par The damage at Old River w
as increased but not initiated by the 1973 flood. The invasive scouring of the channel bed and the undermining of the control structure may actually have begun in 1963, as soon as the structure opened. In years that followed, loose barges now and again sl
a
mmed against the gates, stuck there for months, blocked the flow, enhanced the hydraulic jump, and no doubt contributed to the scouring. Scour holes formed on both sides of the control structure, and expanded steadily. If they had met in 1973, they might 
have brought the structure down.
\par After the waters quieted and the concrete had been penetrated by exploratory diamond drills, Old River Control at once became, and has since remained, the civil-works project of highest national priority for the U.S. Army Co
rps of Engineers. Through the surface of Louisiana 15, the road that traverses the structure, more holes were drilled, with diameters the size of dinner plates, and grout was inserted in the cavities below, like fillings in a row of molars. The grout was 
c
ement and bentonite. The drilling and filling went on for months. There was no alternative to leaving gates open and giving up control. Stress on the structure was lowest with the gates open. Turbulence in the channel was commensurately higher. The greate
r turbulence allowed the water on the Atchafalaya side to dig deeper and increase its advantage over the Mississippi side. As the Corps has reported, \'93
The percentage of Mississippi River flow being diverted through the structure in the absence of control was steadily increasing.\'94 That could not be helped.
\par After three and a half years, control was to some extent restored, but the extent was limited. In the words of the Corps, \'93The partial foundation undermining which occurred in 1973 inflicted permanent damag
e to the foundation of the low sill control structure. Emergency foundation repair, in the form of rock riprap and cement grout, was performed to safeguard the structure from a potential total failure. The foundation under approximately fifty per cent of 
the structure was drastically and irrevocably changed.\'94 The structure had been built to function with a maximum difference of thirty-seven feet between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya sides. That maximum now had to be lowered to twenty-two feet\emdash 
a diminution that brought forth the humor in the phrase \'93Old River Control.\'94 Robert Fairless, a New Orleans District engineer who has long been a part of the Old River story, once told me that \'93things were touch and go for some months in 1973\'94
 and the situation was precarious still. \'93At a head greater than twenty-two feet, there\rquote s danger of losing the whole thing,\'94 he said. \'93
If loose barges were to be pulled into the front of the structure where they would block the flow, the head would build up, and there\rquote d be nothing we could do about it.\'94
\par A sign appeared on one of the three remaining wing walls: \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Fishing and Shad Dipping off This Wing Wall Is Prohibited}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 
.\'94
\par A survey boat, Navy-gray and very powerful and much resembling PT-109, began to make runs toward the sill upstream through the roiling brown rapids. Year after year\emdash at least five times a week\emdash 
this has continued. The survey boat drives itself to a standstil
l in the whaleback waves a few yards shy of the structure. Two men in life vests, who stand on the swaying deck in spray that curls like smoke, let go a fifty-pound ball that drops on a cable from a big stainless reel. The ball sinks to the bottom. The cr
ewmen note the depth. They are not looking for mark twain. For example, in 1974 they found three holes so deep that it took a hundred and eighty-five thousand tons of rock to fill them in.
\par The 1973 flood shook the control structure a whole lot more than it shook the confidence of the Corps. When a legislative committee seemed worried, a Corps general reassured them, saying, \'93
The Corps of Engineers can make the Mississippi River go anywhere the Corps directs it to go.\'94 On display in division headquarters in V
icksburg is a large aerial photograph of a school bus moving along a dry road beside a levee while a Galilee on the other side laps at the levee crown. This picture alone is a triumph for the Corps. Herbert Kassner, the public-relations director and a mas
ter of his craft, says of the picture, \'93Of course, I tell people the school bus may have been loaded with workers going to fix a break in the levee, but it looks good.\'94
 And of course, after 1973, the flow lines were recomputed and the levees had to be raised. When the river would pool against the stratosphere was only a question of time.
\par The Washington }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Post}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 , in an editorial in November of 1980, called attention to the Corps\rquote 
 efforts to prevent the great shift at Old River, and concluded with this paragraph:
\par Who will win as this slow-motion confrontation between humankind and nature goes on? No one really knows. But after watching Mt. St. Helens and listening to the guesses about its performance, if we had to bet, we would bet on the river.
\par The Corps had alrea
dy seen that bet, and was about to bump it, too. Even before the muds were dry from the 1973 flood, Corps engineers had begun building a model of Old River at their Waterways Experiment Station, in Vicksburg. The model was to cover an acre and a half. A m
o
del of that size was modest for the Corps. Not far away, it had a fifteen-acre model of the Mississippi drainage, where water flowing in from the dendritic tips could get itself together and attack Louisiana. The scale was one human stride to the mile. In
 the time it took to say \'93one Mississippi,\'94 if fourteen gallons went past Arkansas City that was a Project Flood. Something like eight and a half gallon was \'93a high-water event.\'94 \'93It\rquote s the ultimate sandbox\emdash 
these guys have made a profession of the sandbox,\'94 Tulane\rquote s Oliver Houck has said, with concealed admiration. \'93They\rquote ve put the whole river in a sandbox.\'94
 The Old River model not only helped with repairs, it also showed a need for supplementary fortification. Since the first control structure was irreparabl
y damaged, a second one, nearby, with its own inflow channel from the Mississippi, should establish full control at Old River and take pressure off the original structure in times of high stress.
\par To refine the engineering of the auxiliary structure, severa
l additional models, with movable beds, were built on a distorted scale. Making the vertical scale larger than the horizontal was believed to eliminate surface-tension problems in simulating the turbulence of a real river. The channel beds were covered wi
th crushed coal\emdash which has half the specific gravity of sand\emdash 
or with walnut shells, which were thought to be better replicas of channel-protecting rock but had an unfortunate tendency to decay, releasing gas bubbles. In one model, the stilling basin below th
e new structure was filled with driveway-size limestone gravel, each piece meant to represent a derrick stone six feet thick. After enough water had churned through these models to satisfy the designers, ground was broken at Old River, about a third of a 
mile from the crippled sill, for the Old River Control Auxiliary Structure, the most advanced weapon ever developed to prevent the capture of a river\emdash 
a handsome gift to the American Ruhr, worth three hundred million dollars. In Vicksburg, Robert Fletcher\emdash a sturdily built, footballish sort of engineer, who had explained to me about the nutshells, the coal, and the gravel\emdash 
said of the new structure, \'93I hope it works.\'94
\par The Old River Control Auxiliary Structure is a rank of seven towers, each buff with a white cr
own. They are vertical on the upstream side, and they slope toward the Atchafalaya. Therefore, they resemble flying buttresses facing the Mississippi. The towers are separated by six arciform gates, convex to the Mississippi, and hinged in trunnion blocks
 
secured with steel to carom the force of the river into the core of the structure. Lifted by cables, these tainter gates, as they are called, are about as light and graceful as anything could be that has a composite weight of twenty-six hundred tons. Each
 
of them is sixty-two feet wide. They are the strongest the Corps has ever designed and built. A work of engineering such as a Maillart bridge or a bridge by Christian Menn can outdo some other works of art, because it is not only a gift to the imagination
 but also structural in the matrix of the world. The auxiliary structure at Old River contains too many working components to be classed with such a bridge, but in grandeur and in profile it would not shame a pharaoh.
\par The origin Old River Control project, g
oing on line in 1963, cost eighty-six million dollars. The works of repair and supplement have extended the full cost of the battle to five hundred million. The disproportion in these figures does, of course, reflect inflation, but to a much greater exten
t
 it reflects the price of lessons learned. It reflects the fact that no one is stretching words who says that in 1973 the control structure failed. The new one is not only bigger and better and more costly; also, no doubt, there are redundancies in its en
gineering in memory of \rquote 73.
\par In 1983 came the third-greatest flood of the twentieth century\emdash a narrow but decisive victory for the Corps. The Old River Control Auxiliary Structure was nothing much by then but a foundation that had recently been poured in dry 
ground. The grout in the old structure kept Old River stuck together. Across the Mississippi, a few miles downstream, the water rose to a threatening level at Louisiana\rquote 
s maximum-security prison. The prison was protected not only by the mainline levee but 
also by a ring levee of its own. Nonetheless, as things appeared for a while the water was going to pour into the prison. The state would have to move the prisoners, taking them in buses out into the road system, risking Lord knows what. The state went on
 
its knees before the Corps: Do something. The Corps evaluated the situation and decided to bet the rehabilitation of the control structure against the rehabilitation of the prisoners. By letting more water through the control structure, the Corps caused t
he water at the prison to go down.
\par Viewed from five or six thousand feet in the air, the structures at Old River inspire less confidence than they do up close. They seem temporary, fragile, vastly outmatched by the natural world\emdash a lesion in the side of the 
Mississippi butterflied with surgical tape. Under construction nearby is a large hydropower plant that will take advantage of the head between the two rivers and light the city of Vidalia. The channel cut to serve it raises to three the number of artifici
a
l outlets opened locally in the side of the Mississippi River, making Old River a complex of canals and artificial islands, and giving it the appearance of a marina. The Corps is officially confident that all this will stay in place, and supports its clai
m with a good deal more than walnuts. The amount of limestone that has been imported from Kentucky is enough to confuse a geologist. As Fred Chatry once said, \'93
The Corps of Engineers is convinced that the Mississippi River can be convinced to remain where it is.\'94
\par I once asked Fred Smith, a geologist who works for the Corps at New Orleans District Headquarters, if he thought Old River Control would eventually be overwhelmed. He said, \'93Capture doesn\rquote 
t have to happen at the control structures. It could happen s
omewhere else. The river is close to it a little to the north. That whole area is suspect. The Mississippi wants to go west. Nineteen-seventy-three was a forty-year flood. The big one lies out there somewhere\emdash when the structures can\rquote 
t release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way. That is when the river\rquote s going to jump its banks and try to break through.\'94
\par Geologists in general have declared the capture inevitable, but, of course, they would. They know that in 1852 the Yellow River s
hifted its course away from the Yellow Sea, establishing a new mouth four hundred miles from the old. They know the story of catastrophic shifts by the Mekong, the Indus, the Po, the Volga, the Tigris and the Euphrates. The Rosetta branch of the Nile was 
the main stem of the river three thousand years ago.
\par Raphael Kazmann, the hydrologic engineer, who is now emeritus at Louisiana State, sat me down in his study in Baton Rouge, instructed me to turn on a tape recorder, and, with reference to Old River Control, said, \'93
I have no fight with the Corps of Engineers. I may be a critic, but I\rquote m not mad at anybody. It\rquote s a good design. Don\rquote t get me wrong. These guys are the best. If it doesn\rquote t work for them, nobody can do it.\'94
\par A tape recorder was not a necessity for gathering the impression that nobody could do it. \'93More and more energy is being dissipated there,\'94 Kazmann said. \'93
Floods are more frequent. There will be a bigger and bigger differential head as time goes on. It almost went out in \rquote 73. Sooner or later, it will be undermined or bypassed\emdash 
give way. I have a lot of respect for Mother . . . for this alluvial river of ours. I don\rquote t want to be around here when it happens.\'94
\par The Corps would say he won\rquote t be.
\par \'93Nobody knows where the hundred-year flood is,\'94 Kazmann continued. \'93
Perspective should be a minimum of a hundred years. This is an extremely complicated river system altered by works of man. A fifty-year prediction is not reliable. The data have lost their pristine character. It\rquote s a mixture of hydrologic events an
d human events. Floods across the century are getting higher, low stages lower. The Corps of Engineers\emdash they\rquote re scared as hell. They don\rquote t know what\rquote 
s going to happen. This is planned chaos. The more planning they do, the more chaotic it is. Nobody knows exactly where it\rquote s going to end.\'94
\par The towboat Mississippi has hit the point of a sandbar. The depth finder shows thirty-eight feet\emdash indicating that there are five fathoms of water between the bottom of the hull and the bed of the river. The depth finder is on
 the port side of the ship, however, and the sandbar to starboard, only a few feet down. Thus the towboat has come to its convulsive stop, breaking the stride of two major generals and bringing state officials and levee boards out to the rail. General San
ds, the division commander, has a look on his face which suggests that Hopkins has just scored on Army but Army will win the game. There is some running around, some eye-bugging, some breaths drawn shallower even than the sandbar\emdash 
but not here in the pilotho
use. John Dugger, the pilot, and Jorge Cano, the local contact pilot, reveal on their faces not the least touch of dismay, or even surprise, whatever they may feel. They behave as if it were absolutely routine to be aiming downstream in midcurrent at zero
 knots. In a sense, that is true, for this is not some minor navigational challenge, like shooting rapids in an aircraft carrier. This is the Atchafalaya River.
\par A poker player might get out of an analogous situation by reaching toward a sleeve. A basketball player would reverse pivot\emdash 
shielding the ball, whirling the body in a complete circle to leave the defender flat as a sandbar. John Dugger seems to be both. He has cut the engines, and now\emdash looking interested, and nothing else\emdash he lets the current take the 
stern and swing it wide. The big boat spins, reverse pivots, comes off the bar, and leaves it behind.
\par Conversations resume\emdash in the lounge, on the outer decks, in the pilothouse\emdash and inevitably many of them touch on the subject of controls at Old River. General Sands is saying, \'93
Between 1950 and 1973, there was intensification of land use in the lower Mississippi\emdash a whole generation grew up thinking you could grow soybeans here and never get wet. Since \rquote 73, Mother Nature has been trying to catch up. There have 
been seven high-water events since 1973. Now the auxiliary structure gives these folks all the assurance they need that Old River can continue to operate.\'94
\par I ask if anyone agrees that the Atchafalaya could capture the Mississippi near the control structures and not through them.
\par General Sands replies, \'93I don\rquote t know that I\rquote m personally smart enough to answer that, but I\rquote d say no.\'94
\par Lieutenant Colonel Ed Willis asks C. J. Nettles, chief of operations for the New Orleans District, if he thinks the auxiliary structure will do the job.
\par Nettles says, \'93The jury is out on that one,\'94 and adds that he is not as confident about it as others are.
\par At Old River a couple of days ago, near the new structure, Nettles and LeRoy Dugas were looking over a scene full of cargo bar
ges, labor barges, crawling bulldozers, hundreds of yards of articulated concrete mattress revetments recently sunk into place, and millions of tons of new limestone riprap. Nettles asked Dugie how long he thought the new armor would last.
\par Dugie said, \'93Two high waters.\'94
\par General Sands advanced a question: \'93Had man not settled in southern Louisiana, what would it be like today? Under nature\rquote s scenario, what would it be like?\'94 And, not waiting for an answer, he supplies one himself: \'93
If only nature were here, people\emdash except for some hunters and fishermen\emdash couldn\rquote t exist here.\'94
\par Under nature\rquote s scenario, with many distributaries spreading the floodwaters left and right across the big deltaic plain, visually the whole region would be covered\emdash with fresh sediments as w
ell as water. In an average year, some two hundred million tons of sediment are in transport in the river. This is where the foreland Rockies go, the western Appalachians. Southern Louisiana is a very large lump of mountain butter, eight miles thick where
 
it rests upon the continental shelf, half that under New Orleans, a mile and a third at Old River. It is the nature of unconsolidated sediments to compact, condense, and crustally sink. So the whole deltaic plain, a superhimalaya upside down, is to varyin
g
 extents subsiding, as it has been for thousands of years. Until about 1900, the river and its distributaries were able to compensate for the subsidence with the amounts of fresh sediment they spread in flood. Across the centuries, distribution was uneven
,
 as channels shifted and land would sink in one place and fill in somewhere else, but over all the land building process was net positive. It was abetted by decaying vegetation, which went into the flooded silts and made soil. Vegetation cannot decay unle
ss it grows first, and it grew in large part on nutrients supplied by floodwaters.
\par \'93In the seventeenth century, the Mississippi was very porous along its banks, and water left it in many places,\'94 Fred Chatry reminds us. \'93Only at low water was it completely 
confined. Now, in two thousand miles, the first place where water naturally escapes the Mississippi is at Bayou Baptiste Collette\emdash sixty miles below New Orleans.\'94
\par What was a net gain before 1900 has by now been a net loss for nearly a hundred years, and the Louisiana we have known\emdash from Old River and the Acadian world to Bayou Baptiste Collette\emdash 
is sinking. Sediments are being kept within the mainline levees and shot into the Gulf at the rate of three hundred and fifty-six thousand tons a day\emdash shot over the she
lf like peas through a peashooter, and lost to the abyssal plain. As waters rise ever higher between levees, the ground behind the levees subsides, with the result that the Mississippi delta plain has become an exaggerated Venice, two hundred miles wide
\emdash its rivers, its bayous, its artificial canals a trelliswork of water among subsiding lands.
\par The medians of interstates are water. St. Bernard Parish, which includes suburbs of New Orleans and is larger than the state of Delaware, is two per cent terra firma, eighteen per cent wetland, and eighty per cent water. A ring levee may surround a whole 
parish. A ring levee may surround fifty-five square miles of soybeans. Every square foot within a ring levee forces water upward somewhere else.
\par An Alexander Calder might revel in these motions\emdash interdependent, interconnected, related to the flow at Old River. Calder would have understood Old River Control: the place where the work is attached to the ceiling, and below which everything
\emdash New Orleans, Morgan City, the river swamp of the Atchafalaya\emdash dangles and swings.
\par Something like half of New Orleans is now below sea level\emdash as much as fifteen feet. New Orleans, surrounded by levees, is emplaced between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi like a broad shallow bowl. Nowhere is New Orleans higher than the river
\rquote s natural bank. Underprivileged people live in the lower elevations, and always have. The rich\emdash by the river\emdash 
occupy the highest ground. In New Orleans, income and elevation can be correlated on a literally sliding scale: the Garden District on the highest level, Stanley Kowalski in the swamp. The Garden District and its environs are locally known as uptown.

\par Torrential rains fall on New Orleans\emdash enough to cause flash floods inside the municipal walls. The water has nowhere to go. Left on its own, it would form a lake, rising inexorably from one level of the ec
onomy to the next. So it has to be pumped out. Every drop of rain that falls on New Orleans evaporates or is pumped out. Its removal lowers the water table and accelerates the city\rquote 
s subsidence. Where marshes have been drained to create tracts for new housing, ground will shrink, too. People buy landfill to keep up with the Joneses. In the words of Bob Fairless, of the New Orleans District engineers, \'93It\rquote 
s almost an annual spring ritual to get a load of dirt and fill in the low spots on your lawn.\'94 A child jumping up and down on such a lawn can cause the earth to move under another child, on the far side of the lawn.
\par Many houses are built on slabs that firmly rest on pilings. As the turf around a house gradually subsides, the slab seems to rise. Where the dr
iveway was once flush with the floor of the carport, a bump appears. The front walk sags like a hammock. The sidewalk sags. The bump up to the carport, growing, becomes high enough to knock the front wheels out of alignment. Sakrete appears, like putty be
s
ide a windowpane, to ease the bump. The property sinks another foot. The house stays where it is, on its slab and pilings. A ramp is built to get the car into the carport. The ramp rises three feet. But the yard, before long, has subsided four. The carpor
t
 becomes a porch, with hanging plants and steep wooden steps. A carport that is not firmly anchored may dangle from the side of a house like a third of a drop-leaf table. Under the house, daylight appears. You can see under the slab and out the other side
. More landfill or more concrete is packed around the edges to hide the ugly scene. A gas main, broken by the settling earth, leaks below the slab. The sealed cavity fills with gas. The house blows sky high.
\par \'93The people cannot have wells, and so they take rain-water,\'94 Mark Twain observed in the eighteen-eighties. \'93Neither can they conveniently have cellars or graves, the town being built upon \lquote made\rquote 
 ground; so they do without both, and few of the living complain, and none of the others.\'94 The others may not c
omplain, but they sometimes leave. New Orleans is not a place for interment. In all its major cemeteries, the clients lie aboveground. In the intramural flash floods, coffins go out of their crypts and take off down the street.
\par The water in New Orleans\rquote  na
tural aquifer is modest in amount and even less appealing than the water in the river. The city consumes the effluent of nearly half of America, and, more immediately, of the American Ruhr. None of these matters withstanding, in 1984 New Orleans took firs
t place in the annual Drinking Water Taste Test Challenge of the American Water Works Association.
\par The river goes through New Orleans like an elevated highway. Jackson Square, in the French Quarter, is on high ground with respect to the rest of New Orleans,
 but even from the benches of Jackson Square one looks up across the levee at the hulls of passing ships. Their keels are higher than the AstroTurf in the Superdome, and if somehow the ships could turn and move at river level into the city and into the st
adium they would hover above the playing field like blimps.
\par In the early nineteen-eighties, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a new large district headquarters in New Orleans. It is a tetragon, several stories high, with expanses of sheet glass, and it
 is right beside the river. Its foundation was dug in the mainline levee. That, to a fare-thee-well, is putting your money where your mouth is.
\par Among the five hundred miles of levee deficiencies now calling for attention along the Mississippi River, the most serious happen to be in New Orleans. Among other factors, the freeboard\emdash the amount of levee that reaches above flood levels\emdash 
has to be higher in New Orleans to combat the waves of ships. Elsewhere, the deficiencies are averaging between one and two feet 
with respect to the computed high-water flow line, which goes on rising as runoffs continue to speed up and waters are increasingly confined. Not only is the water higher. The levees tend to sink as well. They press down on the mucks beneath them and squi
rt materials out to the sides. Their crowns have to be built up. \'93You put five feet on and three feet sink,\'94
 a Corps engineer remarked to me one day. This is especially true of the levees that frame the Atchafalaya swamp, so the Corps has given up trying to
 fight the subsidence there with earth movers alone, and has built concrete floodwalls along the tops of the levees, causing the largest river swamp in North America to appear to be the world\rquote 
s largest prison. It keeps in not only water, of course, but sil
t. Gradually, the swamp elevations are building up. The people of Acadiana say that the swamp would be the safest place in which to seek refuge in a major flood, because the swamp is higher than the land outside the levees.
\par As sediments slide down the continental slope and the river is prevented from building a proper lobe\emdash as the delta plain subsides and is not replenished\emdash 
erosion eats into the coastal marshes, and quantities of Louisiana steadily disappear. The net loss is over fifty square miles a year. I
n the middle of the nineteenth century, a fort was built about a thousand feet from a saltwater bay east of New Orleans. The fort is now collapsing into the bay. In a hundred years, Louisiana as a whole has decreased by a million acres. Plaquemines Parish
 
is coming to pieces like old rotted cloth. A hundred years hence, there will in all likelihood be no Plaquemines Parish, no Terrebonne Parish. Such losses are being accelerated by access canals to the sites of oil and gas wells. After the canals are dredg
e
d, their width increases on its own, and they erode the region from the inside. A typical three-hundred-foot oil-and-gas canal will be six hundred feet wide in five years. There are in Louisiana ten thousand miles of canals. In the nineteen-fifties, after
 
Louisiana had been made nervous by the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Corps of Engineers built the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, a shipping canal that saves forty miles by traversing marsh country straight from New Orleans to the Gulf. The canal is known as Mr
.
 Go, and shipping has largely ignored it. Mr. Go, having eroded laterally for twenty-five years, is as much as three times its original width. It has devastated twenty-four thousand acres of wetlands, replacing them with open water. A mile of marsh will r
e
duce a coastal-storm-surge wave by about one inch. Where fifty miles of marsh are gone, fifty inches of additional water will inevitably surge. The Corps has been obliged to deal with this fact by completing the ring of levees around New Orleans, thus cre
ating New Avignon, a walled medieval city accessed by an interstate that jumps over the walls.
\par \'93The coast is sinking out of sight,\'94 Oliver Houck has said. \'93We\rquote ve reversed Mother Nature.\'94 Hurricanes greatly advance the coastal erosion process, tearing up lan
dscape made weak by the confinement of the river. The threat of destruction from the south is even greater than the threat from the north.
\par I went to see Sherwood Gagliano one day\emdash an independent coastal geologist and regional planner who lives in Baton Rouge. \'93We must recognize that natural processes cannot be restored,\'94 he told me. \'93We can\rquote 
t put it back the way it was. The best we can do is try to get it back in balance, try to treat early symptoms. It\rquote s like treating cancer. You get in early, you may do something.\'94
 Gagliano has urged that water be diverted to compensate for the nutrient starvation and sediment deprivation caused by the levees. In other words, open holes in the riverbank and allow water and sediment to build small deltas into disappearing parishes. 
\'93If we don\rquote t do these things, we\rquote re going to end up with a skeletal framework with levees around it\emdash a set of peninsulas to the Gulf,\'94 he said. \'93
We will lose virtually all of our wetlands. The cost of maintaining protected areas will be very high. There will be no buffer between them and the coast.\'94
\par Professor Kazmann, of L.S.U., seemed less hopeful. He said, \'93Attempts to save the coast are pretty much spitting in the ocean.\'94
\par The Corps is not about to give up the battle, or so much as imagine impending defeat. \'93Deltas wax and wane,\'94 remarks Fred Chatry, in the pilothouse of the Mississippi. \'93
You have to be continuously adjusting the system in consonance with changes that occur.\'94 Southern Louisiana may be a house of cards, but, as General Sands suggeste
d, virtually no one would be living in it were it not for the Corps. There is no going back, as Gagliano says\emdash 
not without going away. And there will be no retreat without a struggle. The Army engineers did not pick this fight. When it started, they were st
ill in France. The guide levees, ring levees, spillways, and floodways that dangle and swing from Old River are here because people, against odds, willed them to be here. Or, as the historian Albert Cowdrey expresses it in the introduction to \'93Land
\rquote s End,\'94 the Corps\rquote  official narrative of its efforts in southern Louisiana, \'93Society required artifice to survive in a region where nature might reasonably have asked a few more eons to finish a work of creation that was incomplete.
\'94
\par The towboat Mississippi is more than halfway down the Atchafalaya now\emdash 
beyond the leveed farmland of the upper basin and into the storied swamp. The willows on the two sides of the river, however, continue to be so dense that they block from sight what lies behind them, and all we can 
see is the unobstructed waterway running on and on, half a mile wide, in filtered sunlight and the shadows of clouds. A breeze has put waves on the water. Coming over the starboard quarter, it more than quells the humidity and the heat. Nevertheless, as o
ne might expect, most of the people remain indoors, in the chilled atmosphere of the pilothouse, the coat-and-tie comfort of the lounge. A deck of cards appears, and a game of bour\'e9 develops, in showboat motif, among various civilian millionaires
\emdash Ed Kyle, of the Morgan City Harbor & Terminal District, dealing off the top to the Pontchartrain Levee Board, the Lafourche Basin Levee Board, the Teche-Vermilion Fresh Water District. Oliver Houck\emdash 
the law professor, former general counsel of the National Wildlife Federation, whose lone presence signals the continuing existence of the environmental movement\emdash 
naturally stays outdoors. He has established an eyrie on an upper deck, to windward. Tall and loosely structured, Houck could be a middle-aged high jumper, still in shape to clear six feet. His face in repose is melancholy\emdash 
made so, perhaps, by the world as his mind would have it in comparison with the world as he sees it. What he is seeing at the moment\emdash in the center of the greatest river swamp in North America, which he and his battalions worked fifteen years to 
\'93save\'94\emdash is a walled-off monotony of sky and water.
\par General Sands joins him, and they talk easily and informally, as two people will who have faced each other across great quantities of time and paper. Sands remarks again that on inspection trips such as this one he has become wed to being \'93
beaten on the head and shoulders\'94 by almost everyone he encounters, not just the odd ecologue attired in alienation.
\par Houck addresses himself to the head, the shoulders, and the chest, saying that he has deep reservations about Sands\rquote  uniform: all those brass trinkets and serried stars, the castle keeps, the stratified ribbons. He says that Sands\rquote 
 habiliments constitute a form of intimidation, especially in a region of the country that has not lost its respect for the military presence. Sands\rquote  habiliments are not appropriate in a civilian milieu. \'93You are Army\emdash 
an untypical American entity to be performing a political role like this,\'94 Houck says to him, beating on. He tells Sands that he reminds him of \'93a politician on the stump, going around stroking his constituency.\'94 He calls him \'93
a political water czar.\'94
\par Sands implicitly reminds Houck that if it were not for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers there wouldn\rquote t be any stump, the constituency would be somewhere else, and Houck\rquote s neighborhood would be nine feet under water. He says, \'93Under nature
\rquote s scenario, think what it would be like.\'94
\par The water czar, I feel a duty to insert, is not the very model of a major general. If he were to 
chew nails, he would break his teeth. I am not attempting to suggest that he lacks the presence of a general, or the mien, or the bearing. Yet he is, withal, somewhat less martial than most English teachers. Effusive and friendly in a folk-and-country way
, courteous, accommodating, he is of the sort whose upward mobility would be swift in a service industry. Make no mistake, he is a general. \'93Shall we just go to the Four Seasons? A nice little place to have lunch,\'94
 he said one day in Vicksburg, and we drove
 to a large building in the center of town, where his car was left directly in front of the main entrance, beside a bright-yellow curb under various belligerent signs forbidding parking. It stayed there for an hour while he had his crab gumbo.
\par We approach, on the right, a gap in the Atchafalaya\rquote 
s bank, where the willows open to reveal a plexus of bayous. Houck has been complaining that the old Cajun swamp life of the Atchafalaya Basin is gone now, and has been for many years, as a result of the volumes of w
ater concentrated in the floodway and of rules forbidding people to live inside the levees. \'93This single piece of plumbing,\'94 he says of the Atchafalaya, \'93is the last great river-overflow swamp in the world and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 also}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352  the biggest floodway in the world\emdash all to protect Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\'94
 We now come abreast of the gap on the right, and it ends the tedium of the reach upriver. It is a broad window into stands of cypress, their wide fluted bases attached to their redirections in still, dark water. \'93How I love them,\'94
 says Houck, who is a conservationist of the sunset school, with legal skills adjunct to the force of his emotion. Pointing into the beauty of the bayou, he informs General Sands, \'93That\rquote s what it\rquote s all about.\'94
\par The General takes in the scene without comment. In silence, we look at the water-standing trees and into narrow passages that disappear among them. They draw me into thoughts of my own. I first went in there in 1980\emdash 
that is, into the Atchafalaya swamp, away from its floodway levees, and mi
les from the river. There were four of us, in canoes. The guide was Charles Fryling, a professor of landscape architecture at Louisiana State University, who, among the environmentalists of the eighteenth state, plays Romulus to Oliver Houck\rquote 
s Remus. Fryli
ng is a tall man with a broad forehead, whose hair falls straight to his eyes without the slight suggestion that comb or brush has ever been invited to intrude upon nature. In 1973, when he moved into his house, on the periphery of Baton Rouge, it sat on 
a smooth green lawn, in a neighborhood of ranch contemporaries, each on a smooth green lawn. Fryling\rquote 
s yard is now a rough green forest, its sweet gums, grapevine, pepper vine, rattan vine, hackberry, passionflowers, and climbing ferns a showcase of natural succession. In Fryling\rquote s words, \'93It beats the hell out of mowing the lawn.\'94
 The trees are thirty feet high.
\par Fryling speaks in a slow country roll that could win him a job in movies. He would be Li\rquote l Abner, or Candide at Fort Dix\emdash the soldier who appears sl
ow in basic training and dies on an intelligence mission twenty-five miles behind enemy lines. He is a graduate of the illustrious forestry school of the State University of New York (Syracuse), his advanced degree is from Harvard, and\emdash 
to continue the escalation\emdash 
he knows how to get from here to there in the swamp. This is a remarkable feat in seven hundred thousand acres that change so much and so often that they are largely unmappable. Fryling understands the minor bayous. Sometimes they run one way, somet
imes the other. The water contains sediment or is clear. \'93See. The water is clearer. It\rquote s coming toward us. It\rquote s coming down from Bayou Pigeon. We\rquote ll get through.\'94
\par If you ask him what something is, he knows. It\rquote s green hawthorn. It\rquote s deciduous holly. It\rquote s water privet. It\rquote s water elm. It\rquote s a water moccasin\emdash there on the branch of that water oak. The moccasin doesn\rquote 
t move. A moccasin never backs off. Dragonflies land on the gunwales. In the Atchafalaya, dragonflies are known as snake doctors. Leaving the open
 bayou, the canoes turn into the forest and slide among the trunks of cypress under feathery arrowhead crowns. \'93Young cypress need a couple of years on dry land to get started, but we rend so much water through the Atchafalaya that young trees\'94 can
\rquote t get going. So existing cypress are not\emdash as trees are generally thought to be\emdash a renewable resource. We have to protect them in order to have them.\'94
\par To be in the Atchafalaya is to float among trees under silently flying blue herons, to see the pileated woodpecker, to hope to see an ivorybill, to hear the prothonotary warbler. The barred owl has a speaking voice as guttural as a dog\rquote 
s. It seems to be growling, \'93Who cooks for you? Who cooks for y\rquote all?\'94 The barred owl\emdash staring from a branch straight down into the canoes\emdash appears to be a parrot in camouflage. In the language of the Longtown Choctaw, \'93
Hacha Falaia\'94 meant \'93Long River.\'94 (The words are reversed in translation.) Since my first travels with Fryling, those rippling syllables have symbolized for me the bilateral extensions of the phrase \'93control of nature.\'94
 Atchafalaya. The word will now come to mind more or less in echo of any struggle against natural forces\emdash heroic or venal, rash or well advised\emdash when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, t
o take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods. The Atchafalaya\emdash 
this most apparently natural of natural worlds, this swamp of the anhinga, swamp of the nocturnal bear\emdash 
lies between walls, like a zoo. It is utterly dependent on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whose decisions at Old River can cut it dry or fill it with water and silt. Fryling gave me a green-and-white sticker that said \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 atchafalaya}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 .\'94 I put it in a 
window of my car. It has been there for many years, causing drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike to veer in close and crowd my lane while staring at a word that signifies collision.
\par In the Atchafalaya more recently, we came upon a sport fisherman in a skiff called Mon Ark. \'93There\rquote s all kind of land out there now,\'94
 he said. He meant not only that the wet parts were low but also that the dry parts were growing. In the Atchafalaya, the land comes and goes, but it comes more than it goes. As the overflow swamp of the only remaining distributary in the delta\emdash 
the only place other than the mouth of the Mississippi where silt can go\emdash the Atchafalaya is silting in. From a light plane at five hundred feet, this is particularly evident as the reflection of the sun races t
hrough trees and shoots forth light from the water. The reflection disappears when it crosses the accumulating land. If land accretes from the shore of a lake or a bayou, the new ground belongs to the shore\rquote 
s owner. If it accretes as an island, it belongs to the state\emdash 
a situation of which Gilbert would be sure to inform Sullivan. Some fifty thousand acres are caught in this tug-of-war. Wet and dry, three-quarters of the Atchafalaya swampland is privately owned. Nearly all the owners are interested less in t
he swamp than in what may lie beneath it. The conservationists, the Corps, landowners, and recreational interests have worked out a compromise by which all parties putatively get what they want: floodway, fishway, oil field, Eden. From five hundred feet u
p, the world below is green swamp everywhere, far as the eye can see. The fact is, though, that the eye can\rquote 
t see very far. The biggest river swamp in North America, between its demarcating levees, is seventeen miles wide and sixty miles long. It is about half of what it was when it began at the Mississippi River and went all the way to Bayou Teche.
\par The old life of the basin is not entirely gone. It is true that people don\rquote t collect moss anymore to use in stuffing furniture, true that the great virgin cypres
ses are away. Their flared stumps remain, like cabins standing in the water. From the beginning of the nineteenth century, Cajuns made their lives and livings in the swamp. Their grocery stores were afloat, and moved among them, camp to camp. It is true a
ll that has vanished, and the Cajuns live outside the levees, but they and others\emdash operating for the most part alone or in pairs\emdash go into the swamp and take twenty-five million dollars\rquote 
 worth of protein out of the water in any given year. The fish alone can average a thousand pounds an acre, and that, according to Fryling, is \'93more fish than in any other natural water system in the United States\'94\emdash 
two and a half times as productive as the Everglades. The fish are not in the conversation, however, when compared with the crawfish.
\par I know a crawfisherman named Mike Bourque, who lives in Catahoula. I remember as if it were today running his lines with him. \'93Watch your hands. Don\rquote t put \rquote em on the side of the boat. \rquote Cause smash \rquote em,\'94
 he said as we went out of Bayou Gravenburg and headed into the trees. His boat was not a canoe, and the object on the stern was no paddle. It was a fifty-horse Mariner, enough for lift-off if the boat had wings. Bourque\rquote 
s brother-in-law was with us. In French, Bourque told him that he was affecting the balance and to shift his position in the boat. Then, addressing me in English, he said, \'93Watch yourself, I got to jump that log.\'94
 Ahead of us, half hidden in water hyacinths, was an impressive floating log, with a solid diameter of about two 
feet. The boat smashed against it, thrust up and over it, with a piercing aluminum screech. The boat was about seventeen feet long. The brother-in-law, Dave Soileau, called it a bateau. Bourque called it a skiff. \'93French and English\emdash 
we mix it up,\'94 he said. Ordinarily, he works alone, and talks a good deal to himself. \'93When I talk to myself, I talk in French. When I meet other fishermen, ninety per cent of the time we speak French.\'94 If he doesn\rquote 
t know them, he knows where they live, because each town has its accent.
\par Like everyone else, he calls the hyacinths lilies\emdash water lilies. This densely growing plant\emdash a waterborne kudzu, an exotic from the Orient\emdash 
has come to plague Southern waterways and spread over marshes like nuclear winter closing many forms of life. 
That is not the case, however, in the Atchafalaya, where the lilies are good for the crawfish. The young feed on stuff that clings to the roots. On heavy stems, the water hyacinths grow three to four feet high, so a lot of power is needed to get through t
hem. \'93You\rquote ll never see a fisherman with less than a fifty-horse motor.\'94
\par Bourque moved the skiff from tree to tree as if he were on snowshoes in a sugarbush emptying buckets of sap. The crawfish 
cages were chicken-wire pillows with openings at one end. Bourque pulled them out of the water on cords that were tied to the trees, and poured the crawfish into a device that looked something like a roasting pan and was hinged to the side of the boat. He
 
called it the trough. Open at the inner end, it forms a kind of ramp down which the crawfish crawl until they drop into a bucket. Dead bait fish, dead crawfish, and other detritus remain in the trough, and thus the living creatures winnow themselves from 
w
hat is thrown away. Snakes are thrown away. Some of the used bait fish have less remaining flesh than skeletons lifted by waiters who work in white gloves. The larger crawfish weigh a quarter of a pound and are nine inches long, with claw spans greater th
an that. When the bucket is full, the crawfish in their motions seem to simmer at the top. \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 C\rquote est bon. C\rquote est bon. O\'f9 est le sac?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 \'94 said Bourque, and Soileau handed him a plastic-burlap sack. Containing forty pounds each, the sacks began to pile up. The crawf
ish lay quiet. When a sack was moved, or even touched, though, the commotion inside sounded like heavy rain.
\par The boat climbed another log. The engine cavitated. We broke through brush like an elephant. Bourque had been following what he called the driftwoo
d line, where a small change in depth had caused driftwood to linger. To him the swamp topography was as distinctive and varied as the neighborhoods of a city would be to someone else\emdash 
these subworlds of the Atchafalaya, out past Bayou Gravenburg, on toward the Red Eye Swamp. \'93This line used to go in back there, but I moved them out in front,\'94
 he said in a place that seemed much too redundant to have a back or a front. Colored ribbons, which he called flags, helped to distinguish the fishermen\rquote s trees, but h
e could run his lines without them, covering his four hundred cages. He did about sixty an hour. Soileau, using a grain scoop, shoveled dead alewives and compressed pellets of Acadiana Choice Crawfish Bait into each emptied cage, and Bourque returned it t
o the water. Bourque told Soileau, who is a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to quit the government and come work for him. Soileau said, \'93For ten dollars a day?\'94
\par Bourque said, \'93Good future. No benefits.\'94
\par We were in a coulee, which
 is like a slough but deeper and with slushier muds at the bottom. A cage came up with seventy crawfish, all dead. The cage had been too low in the muck, where the creatures died in an anoxic slurry. They stirred it up themselves. The cage should just lig
htly touch the bottom, with the closed end slightly raised.
\par Bourque next pulled up an empty cage. \'93Somebody helped me out,\'94 he remarked, and added that he had occasionally met a thief in the act of raiding one of his cages.
\par Soileau said, \'93There\rquote s only one thing to do. Go straight to him, board his vessel, and start slugging. There have been no deaths.\'94
\par Theft was rising in direct proportion to unemployment. Oil companies owned that part of the swamp. Fishermen have, in fact, been arrested for trespass. Fryling\rquote 
s wife, Doris Falkenheiner, defends them in court. Meanwhile, so many fishermen work the watery forest that there is a plastic ribbon on almost every tree. The fishermen say they have to bring their own trees.
\par We hit another log. We ran between a cypress and its knees. \'93We\rquote re getting up on the ridge,\'94
 Bourque said, referring to a subtle, invisible feature of the bottom of the swamp. Out of a cage came a white crawfish, a male. (The male has longer arms.) Crawfish are red, white, or blue. The white ones li
ke the sand of the ridge. Blue ones are rare. Bourque sees fewer than twenty a year. Now he was reaching down into the water for a cage that had been separated from its string by another fisherman\rquote s motor.
\par \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Touchez la?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 \'94 asked Soileau.
\par Bourque answered, \'93Yes.\'94 Then he said, \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Ah, bon,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 \'94 as he retrieved the cage.
\par \'93Are y\rquote all hungry?\'94 Bourque asked.
\par \'93I live hungry,\'94 said Soileau.
\par Bourque turned off the motor and we stopped for lunch: ham sandwiches, Royal Crown, Mr. Porker fried cured pork skins. It was seven-thirty in the morning.
\par We got up around three-thirty and were driving down the levee by four o\rquote clock\emdash in Bourque\rquote 
s pickup, with the skiff behind. Soileau made the comment that the levees were like cancer, because they had to keep growing while they sank into t
he swamp. After twenty-five miles, we went down a ramp to a boat landing, where forty-one pickups had arrived before us. Roughly five thousand people take crawfish from the swamp, annually trapping twenty-three million pounds.
\par Now, at lunchtime, as the early-morning sun began to penetrate the trees, we were looking out on one lovely scene, with tupelo and cypress rising from the water, and pollen on the water like pale-green silk. \'93The best months are Epp Rill and May,\'94
 Bourque said. \'93The water might rise in October sometimes. I\rquote ll come and try.\'94
 He was wearing mirrored sunglasses, a soft cap with a buttoned visor, white rubber boots, and yellow rubber overalls slashed at the crotch. Of middle height, blond and fine-featured, he had sandy hair around his ear
s and a large curl in back, like a breaking wave. His low-sill mustache looked French. He went to St. Martinville High School, as did Soileau, who married the youngest of Bourque\rquote 
s six sisters. In large script below the windows of a drugstore in St. Martinville, a sign says, \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 Sidney Dupois Pharmacien\emdash Au Service de la Sant\'e9 de Votre Famille.}{

Tesreau, Landreaux, Passeau, Bordagaray, Lajoie, Angelle, and Guidry. Bourque was the youngest in his family and the only sibling male. He explains that Cajuns keep going until they get a male, and this was where the Bourques stopped.
\par Soileau passed the pork skins. Bourque chewed them crunchily. \'93Crawfish are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 \'e9crevisses}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352  in French,\'94 he said.

\par Soileau said, \'93I hear you get only three or four.\'94
\par Bourque had a recipe of which the nouveaux cuisiniers may not have heard. \'93Saut\'e9 onions in butter, then put in fat out of the head for ten or fifteen minutes, then put meat in for a few minutes more,\'94 he said. \'93
Salt. Cayenne pepper. Onion tops. What makes the \'e9touff\'e9e is the fat. Some people put a little roux in there. You can stretch it like that.\'94 Crawfish \'e9touff\'e9
e: the Cajun quenelle de brochet. The meat is ground, but not to the end of texture. On Easter Sunday morning in Catahoula, the Bourques have a crawfish ball. At least, I thought that\rquote 
s what they were saying until I saw what they did. They boiled a hundred pounds of crawfish. They ate a crimson mountain of condensed lobsters.
\par Now we were running in Bayou Eugene, which Soileau and Bourque lyrically pronounced in three syllables\emdash \'93by yooz yen.\'94
 We came upon a beaver on a floating log. This was not the animal that founded a nation, the alert and agile slapper of the boreal lakes. This was a Louisiana beaver\emdash huge, half asleep, prone like a walrus, a mound of cinnamon fur with nothing
 much to do but eat. There was no need to dam a thing here. The Corps of Engineers would see to that. The beaver topples trees just to eat the bark. There is no mandate to practice conservation when you are what is being conserved. \'93
A willow branch eaten by a beaver is just as smooth as if it had been sanded,\'94 Soileau remarked. \'93There\rquote s nothing prettier than a willow branch eaten by a beaver.\'94
 Nutria live in the swamp as well. Bourque said that he sees only four or five alligators a year. A friend of his lost a finger to a cottonmouth. \'93
He was walking through thick lilies, very high lilies, to make a road for his pirogue. The snake bit his finger through a glove.\'94 Among the crowns of the cypress, a heron flapped by. Bourque called it a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 gros bec}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 . Soileau called it a yellow-crowned night heron. Bourque said, \'93The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 
gros bec}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352  is here for the same purpose we are: to get crawfish.\'94 A mulberry-blue crawfish came into the boat from a cage that was deep in the Red Eye Swamp.
\par Farther down the trap line, Bourque said, \'93Crawfish is something hard to understand. When it\rquote s muddier, they\rquote re hungrier. The water\rquote s not muddy enough out here.\'94
 There was a time when that sort of thing was a fact of nature. Now, of course, he blamed the Corps. \'93I\rquote d like more water,\'94 he continued. \'93A lot of times, they\rquote 
ve got much more in the Mississippi than they can use. They say they give us thirty per cent. We don\rquote t know if that\rquote s true.\'94
\par I told him I had seen a tally sheet at Old River Control, and it said that 31.1 per cent had gone down the Atchafalaya the day before.
\par \'93I\rquote d like to see that paper when the river starts dropping,\'94 Bourque responded. \'93I don\rquote t see that we get thirty per cent except when there is plenty of water. If they close the locks, it start dropping fast.\'94
\par I mentioned the towboat Mississippi and its low-water Atchafalaya inspection trip, and asked if he had ever gone aboard to complain.
\par \'93I never heard of that until you mentioned it right now,\'94 he said. \'93They know we want more water. They don\rquote t have to ask.\'94
\par I remembered Rabalais saying, \'93After they built the structure and started stabilizing this water and so on, the main complaint was the people from the Atchafalaya Basin\emdash all your crawfish fishermen, and so on. They claimed they wasn\rquote 
t getting enough water, but over the years they\rquote ve learned to live with it, and they catch as many crawfish, I would say, now as they did then.\'94
\par And Peck Oubre, the lock mechanic, asking Rabalais, \'93Before they put in Old River Lock and the control structure, what was the people talking about when the water used to rise and come through here? Were they complaining about it?\'94
\par \'93No,\'94 said Rabalais. \'93They wouldn\rquote t complain, because there wasn\rquote t nothing you could do.\'94
\par Bourque said that farmers who raise crawfish in artificial ponds\emdash a fairly new and rapidly expanding industry\emdash 
were influencing the Corps to keep the water low in the Atchafalaya in order to squeeze out swamp fishermen like him, whose forebears were swamp fishermen. It is possible that the charge he was making was based on pure suspic
ion, but now that the structures were emplaced at Old River\emdash and the Corps had assumed charge of the latitude flow\emdash suspicion was one more force they had to try to control.
\par As we were heading back toward the landing, Bourque remarked, surprisingly, \'93It\rquote s good we have the levees. Before the levees, the crawfish, they was spread all over.\'94
\par For bait, for gasoline, and so forth, the cost of the day\rquote s run was seventy-five dollars. At the boat landing, Bourque sold the crawfish for three hundred and sixty. The
 buyer was Michael Williams, a youth from New Iberia with a mane of Etruscan hair. He identified himself as a poet, and said, \'93For poems there\rquote s not a market anymore. The days of the Romantic poets is gone. That\rquote s like in the past.\'94
 So he also writes country-and-western lyrics. He recited one that began, \'93Oh, it\rquote s hard to write a love song / If you\rquote ve never been in love.\'94
 He had a pit bull named Demon with him. Demon went into the water and snapped at wave. He tried to bite motorboat waves.
\par I emerge from my
 remembrances standing at the rail, bewitched by the impenetrable vegetation. No part of those scenes that lie behind it can be felt or sensed from the decks of the Mississippi as the towboat moves on between the curtains of willow and straight down the m
iddle of the bifurcated swamp. The others continue to talk, argue. The point is made that if the Mississippi River were to shift into the Atchafalaya the entire basin would fill with sediment and become a bottomland hardwood forest. \'93
When nature shifts, man shifts,\'94
 Oliver Houck says. The petrochemical industries would move to the basin, too, rebuilding themselves on Bayou Eugene, extruding plastics in the Red Eye Swamp. There are people in Morgan City who envision another Ruhr Valley up the Atchafalaya. Mor
gan City would be the new New Orleans.
\par The new New Orleans\emdash seventeen miles from the Gulf\emdash is not far ahead of us now. The landscape is changing to coastal marsh. Going below, I make a circumspect visit to the card game in the lounge. The Pontchartrain Levee
 Board draws three, Teche-Vermilion needs two. Ed Kyle, of Morgan City, whose pockets are familiar with United States currency bearing portraits that most people in their lifetime never see and do not even know exist, throws one dollar into the pot. In th
e center of the table, the greenbacks reach flood stage.
\par Now, through the picture windows at the front of the lounge, our destination is in view: Morgan City, the Cajun Carcassonne\emdash a very small town behind a very high wall. A railroad bridge and two highway
 bridges leap the Atchafalaya and seem to touch gingerly on the two sides, as if they were landing on lily pads. Flood stage in Morgan City is four feet above sea level. A dirt levee protected the town until 1937. It was succeeded by concrete walls six an
d then eight feet high. As floods grew\emdash and the Atchafalaya became the only distributary of the Mississippi\emdash sandbags and wooden baffles were piled up in haste on top of the eight-foot walls. Since it is the Corps\rquote 
 intention that fifty per cent of a Design Fl
ood go down the Atchafalaya, and since Morgan City is on a small island of no relief situated directly in the path of the planned deluge, the Corps has built the present wall twenty-two feet high. It is of such regal and formidable demeanor that it attrac
ts tourists. It is a wall that imagines water\emdash 
a sheet of water at least twenty feet thick between Morgan City and the horizon. The sea wall, as it is known, rises to the skirts of palms that stand in rows behind it. From the approaching towboat we can see a
 steeple, a flagpole, a water tower, but not the town\rquote s low avenues or deeply shaded streets. Damocles would not have been so lonely had he lived in Morgan City. In a proportion inverse to the seawall\rquote 
s great size, the seawall betokens a vulnerability the like of which is hard to find so far from a volcano.
\par Water approaches Morgan City from every side. The Atchafalaya River and its surrounding floodway come down from the north and pass the western edge of town. The seawall is a part of the floodway\rquote s easter
n guide levee. When there are heavy local rains, as there were at the time of the great flood of 1973, water that is kept out of the floodway by the seventy-five miles of the eastern guide levee\emdash 
water that used to go into the swamp and the river when the basin was under the control of nature\emdash 
pools against the levee, caroms in the direction of the Gulf, and assaults Morgan City from the back side. The levee ends on Avoca Island, five or six miles south. The Atchafalaya floodwaters are sometimes so high that 
they go around the end of the levee and come back against Morgan City. Hurricanes also bring floods from that direction, surging from the Gulf like tidal waves.
\par Professor Kazmann, of L.S.U., said, \'93You can\rquote t sell Morgan City short, or I would.\'94 To end its 
days, Morgan City does not require a Design Flood. The Design Flood, at Morgan City, is a million and a half cubic feet per second. LeRoy Dugas, of Old River, once explained to me, \'93
The Old River Control Structures can pass seven hundred and fifty thousand cubic feet per second and the Morganza Spillway six hundred. In that situation, if both of them are wide open, we\rquote ve got Morgan City gasping for air.\'94
 The people of Morgan City are not easily frightened. They would tell Professor Kazmann to get back into his college and Dugie to shut a few gates. Mayor Cedric LaFleur says, \'93I feel safe. I feel secure. We\rquote re not going to wash away.\'94
 If there is a slightly hollow sound as he speaks, it is because Morgan City is sort of like a large tumbler glued to the bottom of an aquarium. The Corps, of course, built Morgan City\rquote 
s great rampart, and graced it with bas-reliefs of shrimp boats and oil rigs\emdash consecutive emblems of Morgan City booms. Everyone is grateful for the wall. Morgan City\emdash in its unusual setting\emdash is depend
ent on the Corps of Engineers in the way that a space platform would depend on Mission Control. The fate of Morgan City is written at Old River. Anything that happens there is relevant to the town.
\par As the towboat passes under the second bridge and turns toward a berth below the seawall, I ask General Sands what sort of complaint he most frequently receives when he comes here. He says, \'93The Corps of Engineers isn\rquote 
t doing enough to protect Morgan City from disaster.\'94
\par The hearing is at nine the next morning, a
board the Mississippi in the thoroughly transformed lounge. Where Teche-Vermilion was taking pots, the scene is now set for the court-martial of Billy Mitchell. In front of various standing flags, the three generals and two civilian members of the Mississ
i
ppi River Commission sit at a large formal table, with General Sands in the central position. A colonel is master of ceremonies, and three other colonels are in the front row. This seems an unlikely place for Clifton Aucoin to present his petitions, but n
ow he stands before them\emdash a man in bluejeans and an open shirt, whose remarks suggest that he has spent a good many days of his life up to his hips in water. \'93My name is Clifton Aucoin,\'94 he testifies. \'93
Very few people pronounce it right, so don\rquote t feel bad about it.\'94 He tells the commission that he once kept a boat tied to the knob of his front door. \'93As far as us people in the back floodwater area, we feel neglected,\'94 he continues. \'93
As far as we can tell, nothing has been fixed. Atchafalaya water just comes around Bayou Chene, it comes right on us backwater people. . . . We feel that it\rquote s just another major flood that\rquote s waiting to hit us if nothing is done about it.\'94
 As a hunter, he further complains of dying trees, of disappearing browse and cover\emdash changes no longer ascribable to nature but now quite obviously conceded to be under the control of the Corps.
\par The commissioners hear Cedric LaFleur, a trimly built man with curly hair and dark, quick eyes. LaFleur says it is \'93a dire relief\'94 to have the seawall comple
ted, and suggests that the Corps stop studying the Avoca Island levee and extend it several miles south\emdash to prevent the floods of the Atchafalaya from going around the levee\rquote 
s tip and coming back upon the town. Terrebonne Parish, east of the proposed extens
ion, has complained to the Corps that an extended levee would deprive Terrebonne marshes of sediment, thereby destroying the marshes. The survival of one parish is in conflict with the survival of another, and each is appealing to the Corps.
\par They hear Mark Denham, of St. Mary Parish: \'93We appreciate y\rquote 
all coming down. We really consider having the Corps as a presence in our area a tremendous asset to our area as far as protection of floodwaters and as far as economic development also.\'94
\par They hear Jesse Fontenot, Curtis Patterson, Gerald Dyson\emdash 
chambers of commerce, levee boards, the government of the state. And, as they inevitably do in Morgan City, they hear Doc Brownell. He comes forward slowly, slightly stoop-shouldered, septuagenarian. This man once entered
 prizefights. There is a trace of smile on his face. He, too, thanks the commission. \'93It\rquote s always a pleasure to see you people come down here. It gives as a little encouragement.\'94
 And then, in effect, he tells the Corps to get its act mobilized and extend 
the levee. For thirty-two and a half years, Doc Brownell was the mayor of Morgan City. LaFleur has been described as his clone. In 1973, when the water went around the end of the levee and came back up Bayou Chene, Brownell, without authority, sank a fift
een-hundred-ton barge in the bayou. The barge acted as a dam and held off the water long enough for the people to build up their defenses and save the city. \'93The nightmare of \rquote 73 is still with us,\'94 Brownell reminds the commission. \'93
We live in a state of apprehension; we live on the whims of the weather of over forty-two per cent of the United States. . . .We live with it twenty-four hours a day.\'94
 He praises the beauty of the new seawall but points out that to the people of Morgan City its extraordinary height is an unambiguous message from the Corps. \'93
We can expect that much more water. It makes us very apprehensive. We have got to extend our defenses.\'94
\par Brownell, who went into medicine because the lumber business was dying, became a sort of bayou Schweitzer, 
delivering babies far out in the swamps, doing surgery in an un-air-conditioned operating room for twelve and fourteen hours a day. Among his closest companions was an alligator called Old Bull, who lived with the Brownell family for thirty-five years. Ol
d Bull died in 1982 and is now in a glass-sided mahogany-framed case\emdash in effect, a see-in coffin\emdash looking almost alive among simulated hyacinths, iris, and moss in Brownell\rquote 
s parlor. Tip to tip, Old Bull is ten and a half feet long. There is a brass footrail 
next to Old Bull and a padded bar above him, with beer tap, soda siphon, and a generous stock of bottles. Brownell took Charlie Fryling and me there one spring day to admire Old Bull and to show us, with the help of pictures, the predicament of Morgan Cit
y. What struck me most of all as he talked was his evident and inherent conviction that a community can have a right to exist\emdash to rise, expand, and prosper\emdash 
in the middle of one of the most theatrically inundated floodplains in the world. To be sure, the natural floodplain is also an artificial floodway\emdash concentrated and shaped\emdash 
and, accordingly, its high waters are all the more severe. In Morgan City, it has become impossible to separate the works of people from the periodic acts of God. \'93We have a lot of resta
urants now and various types of establishments in places vulnerable to the water,\'94 Brownell said. \'93We got to develop on the floodplain. It\rquote 
s the only place we got to develop. We still have got to look for places for people to live. Now, you can see from this map that we\rquote re right in the middle of this floodway. It\rquote s like a funnel with a spout, and we\rquote 
re at the end of that spout. We\rquote re in the concentration part of it. We have our homes, our families, our whole future in the floodway. We\rquote ve got to live with these problems\emdash 
and to me it ought to be some type of priority for the people who live under these conditions twelve months out of the year should be given some type of preference as to what our future is. It\rquote s the nation\rquote 
s problem, and we are only the victims here of a lot of things that does happen here that are imposed upon us. We lost the big live oaks in the park because of the long-standing floodwater. A flood doesn\rquote 
t last for weeks here, as it does in some of those northern places. Our floods last for m
onths. The more ring levees are built to the north, the more water Morgan City gets. In whatever way the people upriver protect themselves, they send more water to Morgan City. If people dig canals to get water off their land, it goes to Morgan City. When
 you\rquote re drowning, you don\rquote t need more water.\'94
\par Tarzan of the Apes once leaped about among the live oaks in the park. The first Tarzan movie was filmed in Morgan City. The Atchafalaya swamp was Tarzan\rquote s jungle. Black extras in costumes pretended they were Africans.
\par Not far from Old Bull, the head of another alligator was in use as a lamp\emdash 
its mouth open, a light bulb in the back of its throat. Stuffed owls and hawks were hanging on the walls, and Canada geese were flying through the air. There were the heads of
 deer, of black bears from the Atchafalaya swamp. Brownell said his father had killed six bears shortly before he died. There was a stuffed tarpon head as large as the head of a horse. The tarpon was caught in the Atchafalaya River near Morgan City before
 
the river, increasing in volume and power, pushed back the salt water. Islands now stand where the river was a hundred feet deep. As the Atchafalaya has grown, more and more sediments have, of course, come with it, stopping where they reach still water. T
h
is is the one place in Louisiana, other than the mouth of the Mississippi, where new coastal land is forming. Large areas of what was once Atchafalaya Bay have become dry flats. The soil broke the surface as the flood receded in 1973. Whole islands appear
ed at once. The bay was choked. Brownell says the river built a dam there. A geologist would call it a delta.
\par Charles Morgan, a shipper in New Orleans in the eighteen-fifties and sixties, was so irritated by New Orleans\rquote  taxes, New Orleans\rquote  dockage fees, and New Orleans\rquote 
 waterfront clutter that he moved his operation to the Atchafalaya and developed a competing city. It seems unlikely that he was aware that the Mississippi River meant to follow him. Morgan City thrived on shipping, on oysters. When the big c
ypresses were felled in the Atchafalaya swamp, Morgan City became the center of the cypress industry in the United States: numerous sawmills, hundreds of schooners in the port. Brownell\rquote 
s great-grandfather owned a sawmill. In the nineteen-thirties, Captain Ted Anderson, a Florida-based fisherman, was blown off course by a storm, and put in at Morgan City. In the hold of his boat were shrimp of a size unfamiliar in Morgan City\emdash 
big ones, like croissants, from far offshore. They were considered repulsive, and 
at first no one wanted them, but these jumbos of the deep Gulf soon gave Morgan City the foremost shrimp fleet in the world. As the Atchafalaya River pushed back the salt water, it pushed out of the marshes the nurseries of shrimp. Caught in the westbound
 
littoral drift, the shrimp went to Texas, where much of the business is now. The growth of cypresses was too slow to keep up with the lumber industry, so the lumber industry collapsed. The next boom was in oil. The big offshore towers come out of the mars
h
lands surrounding Morgan City. They are built on their sides and dominate the horizon like skeletons of trapezoidal blimps. Of the twelve hundred and sixty-three permanent platforms now standing in the Gulf on the continental shelf, eighty-eight per cent 
are off Louisiana.
\par In other words, the people of Morgan City are accustomed to taking nature as it comes. Cindy Thibodaux, the town archivist\emdash a robust young poet with cerulean eyes and a fervent manner of speaking\emdash said to me one day, \'93When you\rquote 
re fishing in the bayou, you\rquote re out in nature with the oil industry all around you.\'94 She has written a poem about the oil industry and nature from an alligator\rquote s perspective.
\par In the presence of the tribunes on the towboat, as the Pontchartrain Levee District recites its needs and the State of Louisiana its concerns\emdash 
as the discussion touches upon the varied supplication of the whole deltaic plain, and on the growth of the extremities of the great levee system not only below Morgan City but down the Mississippi from Bohemia to Baptiste Collette\emdash 
my mind cannot help drifting back to Old River, where every part of this story in a sense had its beginnings and could also have its end. Near the mouths of the intake channels of Old River Control, the Corps maintains another towbo
at, smaller than the Mississippi but no less powerful\emdash a vessel on duty twenty-four hours a day and not equipped with white couches, wall-to-wall windows, or venetian blinds\emdash the name of which is Kent.
\par Kent is a picket boat. It defends Old River Control. With its squared bow and severed aspect, it appears to be a piece of wharf that loosened like a tooth and came out on the river. Kent\rquote 
s job is to catch, hold, and assist any vessel in trouble. If barges break loose upstream and there is insufficient time to t
ie them up, Kent is supposed to divert them. Technically, it is a twin-screw steel motor rug, eighty-five feet long, with two nine-hundred-horse diesels that can start at the touch of buttons. (Compressed air makes that possible.) It cost two million doll
ars and differs from most river towboats only in its uncommon electronics\emdash 
the state and variety of its radar, the applications of its multiple computers. In addition to the on-board radar, two radar beams sweep the river from the bank at stations four miles
 apart, and anything that reflects from these beams appears on a screen in Kent. If a tow rig is moving at the speed of the current, an alarm goes off, for the coincidental speed suggests that the rig is without power. Kent can tell this eight miles away.

\par Fifteen miles up the river, in April of 1964, twenty barges full of ore were tied to the bank and left there unattended. Eight of them broke free. There was no picket boat then. As a functioning valve, the control structure at Old River was nine months ol
d
. As the ore-laden barges drifted near, they were drawn away from the Mississippi, sucked into the structure by the power of the Atchafalaya. One of them plunged through the gates and sank on the lower side. Three sank in front of the gates and effectivel
y
 closed the structure. A standard barge is a hundred and ninety-five feet long. Water piled up. Weeks went by. Much of the time, the difference in water level between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya sides was thirty-five feet, a critical number that resul
ted in damage and \'93threatened the integrity of the structure\'94\emdash the Corps\rquote  way of saying that it might have been wiped out.
\par Today, it is illegal to tie anything to either bank of the Mississippi within twenty upstream miles of the structures at Old River. Every approaching vessel has to radio Kent and, as Dugas puts it, \'93
say what he is, who he is, and if he has a red-flag product.\'94 And for ignorant river pilots and all uninitiated craft there\rquote s a very large sign high up the bank of the river\emdash its first three words in red:

\par Spring high water often knocks the sign away.
\par It would be difficult to overestimate the power
 of the draw, deriving, as it does, from the Atchafalaya, by now, in point of discharge, the seventh-strongest river in the world. The Coast Guard once tried to set five warning buoys in the west side of the Mississippi, but could not keep them in place, 
because the suction was so fierce. This threat to navigation could be called an American Maelstrom\emdash a modern Charybdis, a Corryvreckan\emdash were it not so very much greater in destructive force. In Dugie\rquote s words, \'93
Any rig on the right side of the river is in trouble.\'94
\par An empty barge and three barges loaded with quarry stones were sucked into the low sucked into the low sill in 1965. Two loaded barges went through the structure and sank on the Atchafalaya side. The other sank against the gates without causing appar
ent damage, but it must have contributed to the turbulences that even then were undermining the structure. After the great flood of 1973 and the considerable debilitation it disclosed, there was the constant danger that if several loose barges were to blo
ck the flow and the difference in water levels were to build to catastrophic proportions nothing could be done about it. One barge spent a flood against the gates in 1974, but the structure survived.
\par People in Simmesport often refer to Old River Control as \'93the second locks.\'94 John Hughes, the supervisor of Kent and one of its operators, does his best to correct them. \'93That\rquote s not a lock, that\rquote s a control structure,\'94
 he says. And a Simmesport person says, \'93Well, we was born and raised here, and we call it the second locks.\'94
 To judge by the amount of traffic erroneously attracted to the control structure, they have a point. A boat comes down the river, takes a right, and heads for Old River Control, thinking that it is Old River Navigation Lock. Usually, the boat is smaller
\emdash a cabin cruiser, or something of the sort\emdash but the mistake has been made by a fifteen-barge tow. Its skipper called in on the radio to the navigation lock, announcing his arrival. The people at the lock replied that they didn\rquote 
t see him. He said, \'93I\rquote m right here looking at you, I\rquote m coming in.\'94 The mistake was corrected just in time.
\par In 1982, thirty-nine barges broke loose thirteen miles upstream at four in the morning. The whole rig just came apart. Dugie recalls, \'93He was in a bend of the river. He couldn\rquote t maneuver the river. He hit the bank.\'94
 The picket boat went after the barges. Five other skippers, joining their units together, detached four towboats that came to help. \'93They could see the picket boat had a lot of problems, trying to catch thirty-nine barges by himself,\'94
 Dugie says. At 6 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs22\i\insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 a.m.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid5583811\charrsid8089352 
, right at the entrance to the intake channel of Old River Control, the last barge was caught. Not even one hit the gates. Two of the thirty-nine were red-flag barges, loaded with petroleum. Later that year
, a fifteen-barge rig heading north in the dark swung too close to Old River Control, was drawn off course, and\emdash its engines overmatched by the force of the water\emdash 
crashed in the sand on the north side of the intake-channel mouth. In 1983, at midnight, a towboat with three jumbo barges lost power at Black Hawk Point, two miles above the structure. The picket boat caught it before it reached the channel.
\par The operator on that occasion was Gerald Gillis, whose broad full face and long jet-black hair lend him the look of an Elizabethan page after twenty-five years in Morgan City. He is one of eight men who work Kent\emdash 
two on a shift. One day, he took me out on the beat with him, running up the river. He said the speed of the Mississippi current ranges from about thr
ee knots in low water to six in spring and eight in flood. A rig coming downstream on this September day would be averaging about eight knots. To conserve fuel, the big thirty-five-barge tows like to crawl along just barely ahead of the speed of the river
,
 and that confuses Kent, because the tows could be dead in the water. An example was descending toward us now, called Gale C, shoving thirty-five barges of grain and cord, and much alive in the river, as Gillis learned from his transceiver. While the huge
 rig was passing by us\emdash really an itinerant island, eight thousand horsepower and a third of a mile long, with its barges in seven ranks of five\emdash 
he said the rough rule of thumb for fuelling such an enterprise is one gallon per horsepower per day.
\par Gillis turned on the depth finder. We had come up the Mississippi\rquote 
s east side, and now he swung crosscurrent, heading for the cutbank of the west-convexing bend just above the structures of Old River. As we traversed the Mississippi, the depth, which was being sketch
ed by a stylus on graph paper, dropped steadily and kept on dropping the closer we came to the bank. We were only a few swimming strokes from shore when the depth reached a hundred feet. It was notable that the riverbed was fifty feet below sea level more
 
than three hundred miles from the mouth of the river, but what particularly astounded me was the very great depth so close to the west bank. It showed the excavating force of a tremendous river. The foundations of skyscrapers are rarely that deep. And thi
s was the bend where the water swung off and into Old River Control\emdash a bend armored with concrete where the Mississippi might break free and go to the Atchafalaya. Kent was so close to the bank that it had no room to turn. Gillis backed away.
\par Twenty years before, a barge that broke loose and was crumpled after sinking at the structure was hauled up the intake channel and left by the edge of the river. The barge had not moved since then, but the Mississippi\rquote s bank\emdash 
consumed by the scouring currents\emdash had eroded to the west. The barge now lay five hundred feet out in the Mississippi.
\par General Sands, reflecting on these matters, once said, \'93The Old River Control Structure was put in the wrong place. It was designed to a dollar figure.\'94
\par And Fred Bayley, his chief engineer, added, \'93That is correct. It was done during the Eisenhower Administration.\'94
\par The Corps once attempted to barricade the intake channel with a string of barges anchored in the river. Drift\emdash as the big logs are called that unremittingly come down the river\emdash 
amassed against the anchoring cables until enough had gathered to heave high and start breaking the cables. As if drift were not enough of a problem, ice has been known to appear as well. It may come only once in twenty years, but ice it is, in Louisiana.

RO coordinates closely with law enforcement partners within the U.S. and around the world. One of the most notable law enforcement coordination and partnership efforts within ERO involves the biometric and biographic identification of priority aliens who 
are incarcerated within federal, state, and local prisons and jails.
\par ERO works with law enforcement partners in the shared responsibility for ensuring the safety of our communities through a variety resources and programs. The 287(g) program enables a state
 or local law enforcement entity to receive delegated authority, training, and technology resources for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions. ICE's Law Enforcement Support Center coordinates response and enforcement actions with law enforcem
ent partners using biometrics to identify foreign-born individuals arrested for criminal offenses.
\par ERO also enhances the impact of multi-agency task forces through its administrative authority to arrest individuals deemed a threat to public safety on their 
unlawful immigration status without additional criminal charges. Finally, leveraging resources available through foreign law enforcement partners including INTERPOL and the ICE Attach\'e9
 corps, ERO develops investigative leads and provides support in locating and arresting foreign nationals wanted for crimes committed abroad who are now at-large in the U.S.

With a workforce numbering approximately 20,000 including deportation officers, special agents, analysts, and professional staff, ICE stands at t
he forefront of our nation's efforts to strengthen border security and prevent the illegal movement of people, goods, and funds into, within, and out of the United States. The agency's broad investigative authorities are directly related to our country's 
ongoing efforts to combat terrorism at home and abroad.
\par HSI is the largest contributor to the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces and employs its unique and exclusive immigration and trade-based authorities to disrupt terrorist networks and prevent attacks 
against the homeland. This work includes HSI initiating investigations into transnational criminal organizations and subjects of national security concern or interest who are involved in narcotics smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, and immigratio
n
 document and benefit fraud, as well as investigating trade-based money laundering and intellectual property crimes used to finance or support terrorists or their activities. HSI is also responsible for preventing terrorist groups, illicit procurement net
works, and hostile nations from acquiring U.S. military hardware, sensitive technical data, dual-use technology, and other materials used to develop weapons of mass destruction.
\par HSI and ERO are recognized as essential partners in numerous national and inter
national task force operations that target terrorist activities and are dedicated to investigating, prosecuting, and removing human rights violators and war criminals to prevent the U.S. from becoming a safe haven.

The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), establishes a presumption that records in the possession of agencies and departments of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government are available to the public. The FOIA sets standards for determi
ning when Government records must be made available and which records may be withheld. The FOIA also gives requesters specific legal rights and provides administrative and judicial remedies when access to records or portions of records is denied. The FOIA
 statute requires that Federal agencies provide access to and disclosure of information pertaining to the Government's business to the fullest extent possible.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs20\insrsid14171162\charrsid8089352 The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \'a7 552a,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid14171162\charrsid8089352 
 establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records i
s
 a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires that agencies give the public notice of their systems of record
s
 by publication in the Federal Register. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent the written consent of the subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. The Ac
t also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records, and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements.
\par Congress provided special protection in the FOIA for three narrow categories of law enforcement an
d national security records. The provisions protecting those records are known as exclusions. The first exclusion protects the existence of an ongoing criminal law enforcement investigation when the subject of the investigation is unaware that it is pendi
ng and disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The second exclusion is limited to criminal law enforcement agencies and protects the existence of informant records when the informant\u146\'92
s status has not been officiall
y confirmed. The third exclusion is limited to the FBI and protects the existence of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism records when the existence of such records is classified. Records falling within an exclusion are 
not subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Thus, when the agency responds to your request it will limit its response to those records that are subject to the FOIA.

\par Bulk Cash Smuggling is a reporting offense under the Bank Secrecy Act, and is part of the United States Code (U.S.C.). The code stipulates:
\par Whoever, 
with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement, knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments on the person of such individual or in any conveyance, article of luggage, merchandise, or other container, and trans
p
orts or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the United States to a place outside of the United States, or from a place outside the United States to a place within the United States, shal
l be guilty of a currency smuggling offense.
\par Not necessarily. The statute that governs bulk cash smuggling does require proof that a suspect intended to cross the border. However, criminal organizations rely on complex transportation and smuggling networks to move and launder their illicit proceeds.

\par For example, bulk cash intended for a drug trafficking organization in Colombia may begin its journey in Philadelphia, Pa., and travel through many locations, along several routes, before arriving at the border. 
Those same proceeds may then move through Mexico, Panama or other countries before arriving at their destination.
\par ICE HSI has broad authority to investigate these criminal networks, and may rely on other financial and criminal statutes, to prosecute violators and seize assets at the border, within the United States and internationally.
\par Title 31 U.S.C. \'a7 5332 (Bulk Cash Smuggling) makes it a crime to smuggle or attempt to smuggle more than $10,000 in currency or monetary instruments into or out of the United
 States, with the specific intent to evade the U.S. currency reporting requirements codified in Title 31 U.S.C. \'a7\'a7 5316 and 5317.
\par ICE HSI relies on other financial authorities granted under Title 31 U.S.C. (Money and Finance), specifically those related to
 violations of reporting requirements and structuring financial transactions, as well as criminal authorities, such as Title 18 U.S.C. \'a7 1960 (Unlicensed Money Transporter/Transmitter), Title 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 1952 (Interstate and Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Enterprises) and Title 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 1956 (Money Laundering). These authorities allow ICE HSI to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks that move bulk cash, wherever they may operate.
\par Criminal organizations smuggle bulk cash to keep their proceeds and related activities away from the scrutiny of financial regulators and law enforcement agencies.
\par The United States has the most advanced and comprehensive anti-money laundering and financial regulatory framework in the world. Financial t
ransaction reports assist investigators with flagging potential criminal activity, identifying criminally derived assets and disrupting criminal financial flows.

. The Center focuses on its mission in two primary ways: by identifying, investigating, prosecuting, and removing human rights violators and war criminals found within the jurisdiction of the United States; and by preventing the entry into the United Stat
e
s of known or suspected human rights violators and war criminals. The Center also works with foreign law enforcement, international partners, and international tribunals to further global accountability. The Center brings together special agents and intel
l
igence research specialists, analysts, historians and attorneys with expertise in specific regional target areas or conflicts. These team members, joined by our Center partners, are organized into investigative regional support teams (RST) which cover the
 
geographic areas of the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In 2016, the Center created a team dedicated to the elimination of female genital mutilation (FGM) of girls in the United States. In 2018, the Center created an investigative tea
m
 dedicated to developing targets who are responsible for human rights violations that could be sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The Center is also home to the Human Rights Target Tracking Team (HRT3), comprised of int
e
lligence research specialists dedicated to accurately identifying suspected human rights violators and war criminals while the individuals are still abroad. HRT3 workswith United States government partner agencies to prevent the entry of these individuals
 into the United States in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as well as to preclude them from obtaining immigration benefits overseas. 
\par 3The Center has worked closely over the past several years with our partners in U.S. Customs and Bor
der Protection (CBP) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)to identify known or suspected human rights violators and to place lookouts on them in appropriate databases so that consular officers overseas, CBP officers at United States ports 
o
f entry, and USCIS officers will have relevant information to assist in determining whether an individual should be permitted to enter the United States. Dedicated funding, first provided by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, has gre
atly enhanced the Center\rquote s ability to increase investigative and legal efforts to combat crimes against humanity, human rights abuses, and war crimes. This funding resulted in a significant increase in resources dedicated to the Center\rquote 
s work. In 2014, ICE 
HSI had eight investigators and intelligence research specialists assigned to the HRVWCU. Today, ICE HSI has 23 dedicated agents, analysts, intelligence research specialists and historians researching, investigating, and supporting the important work of t
h
e Center. Including our partners, the Center now has a team of 50 individuals dedicated to our mission. With this support, ICE HSI tripled its number of criminal arrests in fiscal year (FY)2017 and 2018, compared to criminal arrests in FY 2016. Additional
l
y, ICE HSI doubled the number of investigations that have led to indictments of human rights violators in this same time period.In 2016, ICE conducted its inaugural Human Rights Violators and War CrimesAdvanced Investigative Training course at the Federal
 
Law Enforcement Training Centers in Georgia. This training brought together s pecial agents, attorneys and other law enforcement professionals to learn about the investigative techniques unique to cases involving human rights violators. It established a c
o
re group of investigators and attorneys whose expertise enhanced the existing pool of law enforcement personnel specializing in these types of investigations. The Center continues to provide this advanced training course on an annual basis. Most important
l
y, these dedicated funds allowed the Center to fund investigative teams to travel overseas in cases that had languished. In-country investigations at the site of the atrocities are crucial to obtaining evidence and to identifying witnesses who can corrobo
rate allegations against specific individuals suspected of engaging in human rights abuses. The Center\rquote 
s commitment to its mission and the role it plays in broader efforts for accountability is illustrated in various cases in Africa, the Americas, and the Balkans. While most of the Center\rquote 
s work is focused on modern day war crimes, we continue to pursue, in partnership with HRSP, the remaining World War II Nazi leads developed by DOJ.In August 2018, through close cooperation with our partners at the DOJ and 
DOS, ICE removed to Germany Jakiw Palij, a former Nazi labor camp guard at the SS Training Camp in Trawniki in Nazi-occupied Poland. I would like to elaborate on a few examples of our successful criminal cases. The first case involved Mohammed Jabbateh, a
ka \'93Jungle Jabbah,\'94
 who served as a General in the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO), a rebel group that battled for control of Liberia in the 1990s, during the first Liberian civil war. On three occasions, ICE HSI agents from Phil
adelphia, the Center\rquote s Africa researcher, and members of the United 
\par 4States Attorney\rquote s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania traveled to Liberia tointerview over 30 eyewitnesses. These eyewitnesses provided firsthand accounts of acts of torture,
 rape, cannibalism, and murder committed by Jabbateh and his band of soldiers. Our investigation and the successful prosecution of Jabbateh by the U.S. Attorney\rquote 
s Office are reflective of the cooperative partnership between ICE and the DOJ. On October 18, 2017, a jury found Jabbateh guilty of two counts of violating 18 U.S .C . \'a7 1546 (immigration fraud), and two counts of violating 18 U.S .C . \'a7
 1621 (perjury). On April 19, 2018, the District Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sentenced Jabbateh to 30 years\rquote 
 incarceration, well above the sentencing guidelines for these crimes. This sentence, the highest thus far for immigration fraud committed by a human rights violator, was possible due to the work by ICE and HRSP to amend the sentencing guideli
nes to provide for upward departures when the defendants engaged in human rights violations. Another significant investigation and criminal prosecution involved the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which Hutu extremists raped and murdered hundreds of thousands of
 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. In March 2011, ICE received information from the Rwandan government, as well as from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), that Gervais \'93Ken\'94
 Ngombwa, a United States citizen residing in the United States, led ma
ssacres in the Nyamata area, including at the church and commune office where an estimated 10,000 men, women, and children attempting to seek refuge were murdered.A majority of those killed had sought refuge inside the church walls where they were slaught
ered with guns, machetes, and other weapons. Following a multi-year Center and HSI Cedar Rapids investigation, including several investigative trips to Rwanda, the United States Attorney\rquote 
s Office for the Northern District of Iowa successfully prosecuted Ngombwa, who was convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \'a7 1425 (unlawfully procuring, or attempting to procure, naturalization or citizenship); one count of violating 18 U.S.C. 
\'a7 371 (conspiracy to unlawfully procure citizenship); and one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \'a7 1001 (making a materially false statement to agents of the Department of Homeland Security). Ngombwa\rquote 
s United States citizenship was automatically revoked, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \'a7 1451(e). In March 2017, Ngombwa was sentenced to 15 years\rquote  
incarceration. This case succeeded due to strong cooperation between the Center, HSI Cedar Rapids, the HSI Pretoria ( South Africa), one of ICE\rquote s 68 Attach\'e9 offices located at United States diplomatic posts worldwide, the United States Attorney
\rquote s Office for the Northern District of Iowa, DOJ\rquote s Office of International Affairs, DOS, and the ICTR. The investigation, criminal conviction, and extradition to Spain of Inocente Orlando Montano in November 2017 highlights the Center
\rquote s role in broader efforts for accountability. Montano, who served in several command posts and ultimately as El Salvador\rquote s Vice Minister for Public Security during the country\rquote 
s 1980-1992 civil war, was part of the small core group of elite officers responsible for the 1989 murder in San Salvador of six Spanish Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and the housekeeper\rquote 
s teenage daughter. With the specialized assistance of an expert witness and the Center\rquote s historian for the Americas, an investigation led by HSI Boston and prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\rquote 
s Office in Boston, Massachusetts resulted in Montano\rquote s conviction of three counts of violating 18 U.S .C . \'a7 1546 (immigration fraud) and three counts of violating 18 U.S .C . \'a7
 1621 (perjury). The trial documented over 1,150 human rights violations committed by units or troops under Montano\rquote 
s command, including 65 extrajudicial killings, 51 disappearances, and 520 cases of torture. In August 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts sentenced Montano to 21 months
 incarceration and issued a judicial order of removal to El Salvador. Montano\rquote s incarceration 
\par 5afforded Spain sufficient time to perfect an extradition request for the crime of terrorist murder. This was significant as El Salvador had previously refused t
o cooperate with Spanish arrest warrants for other defendants living in El Salvador. The Secretary of State certified Montano\rquote s extradition to Spain and, despite Montano\rquote 
s appeal, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear his case. ICE HSI\rquote s investi
gation and the subsequent criminal conviction were instrumental in ensuring Montano would face justice in Spain as opposed to enjoying impunity in El Salvador. There have also been a number of successes in cases involving the war in the former Yugoslavia 
i
n the 1990s. The Center continues to initiate law enforcement action against individuals who assisted in the genocide at Srebrenica in 1995. While there have been tremendous successes in identifying and removing particular targets from the United States, 
t
here continue to be litigation challenges which the Center is working to overcome. The Center will continue to prioritize the cases of both direct perpetrators and aiders and abettors.In addition to the Srebrenica cases, the Center and its partners contin
u
e to hold human rights violators from the Balkans accountable. For instance, Slobodan Mutic, a former member of the breakaway ethnic Serb forces in Croatia, allegedly murdered two citizens of Croatian ethnicity in the town of Petrinja, Croatia, in January
 1992. The Center\rquote s Balkan historian performed substantial original historical research and located a large number of wartime and postwar records in present-day Croatia which substantiated Mutic\rquote 
s alleged crimes. The Center worked with HSI Cleveland and our DOJ partners at the United States Attorney\rquote s Office in Cleveland, Ohio to indict the case. As a result, Mutic pleaded guilty to one count of violating 18 U.S .C . \'a7
 1546 (immigration fraud) for failing to disclose his role in the ethnically motivated murders; he was sentenced to 2-years\rquote 
 incarceration. ICE coordinated with Croatian officials to return Mutic to Croatia where he is being tried for his wartime acts. Slobo Maric, a former member of the Bosnian army, was a shift leader of a detention facility i
n Bosnia that housed captured Bosnian Croat soldiers. He selected detainees for other guards to abuse, directly participated in abusing several prisoners, and sent prisoners todangerous and deadly work details on the front line of the conflict. The case w
as investigated by HSI Jacksonville and the Center and prosecuted by DOJ\rquote s HRSP and the United States Attorney\rquote 
s Office for the Middle District of Florida. In March 2017, Maric was sentenced by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Flo
rida to 18 months incarcerationfor unlawfully procuring, or attempting to procure, naturalization or citizenship in violation of 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 1425. These charges were the result of his failure to disclose during his naturalization process his membership in 
the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and crimes that he committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war in the 1990s. The Court immediately revoked his United States citizenship, and Maric is now in immigration removal proceedings. The Bosnian government
 
has charged Maric for his criminal conduct. In addition to the successes discussed above in criminal matters, immigration laws have also been a powerful tool to deny safe haven to human rights violators in the United States, and in so doing, to contribute
 to the global fight to prevent future atrocities. For example, Center-supported cases resulted in the removal of two former Ministers of Defense of El Salvador, Carlos Vides Casanova in April 2015 and Jos\'e9
 Guillermo Garcia Merino in January 2016. Both were removed based on grounds that they had \'93assisted or otherwise participated\'94 in multiple instances of torture and extrajudicial killings in El Salvador during the 1980s. These cases 
\par 6relied on the testimony of torture survivors as well as the testimony of
 an expert witness and a former United States Ambassador to El Salvador. The case against Casanova resulted in a published decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) concluding that in his role as a commander during the civil war in El Salvador, C
a
sanova assisted or otherwise participated in extrajudicial killings and torture. The decision specifically recognized by name two Salvadoran torture survivors who testified in court, as well as nine victims of extrajudicial killing, six of whom were Unite
d
 States citizens. The victims included four churchwomen, Ita Ford, Maura Clarke, Dorothy Kazel, and Jean Donovan who were killed in December 1980, as well as Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman, who were killed together with a Salvadoran colleague in January
 1981. The decision also found Casanova removable for his role in the torture and extrajudicial killing of \'93countless unnamed\'94 civilians. Similarly, the BIA\rquote 
s opinion in the Garcia Merino case held that he knew or should have known about extrajudicial killi
ng and torture, under the theory of command responsibility, and that he fostered an institutional atmosphere in which defenseless civilians were victimized. The court ruled, among other findings, that through Garcia Merino\rquote 
s acts and omissions, especially in failing to properly investigate and hold perpetrators accountable, he had \'93assisted or otherwise participated\'94
 in the extrajudicial killings of Archbishop OscarRomero; approximately 1,000 civilians, many of whom were children, at the El Mozotemassacre; 
and the six United States citizens described above. It is important to acknowledge a broad range of intergovernmental bodies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who have assisted ICE with identifying potential suspects, witnesses, and victims, as wel
l
 as providing crime scene information and language support. Their intrepid work is essential to so many successful human rights investigations and prosecutions. For example, as a result of efforts by NGOs to uncover and document incidents of extrajudicial
 killings in Colombia referred to as \'93false positives,\'94 the Center identified two perpetrators residing in the United States - Hector Alejandro Cabuya de Le\'f3n and Lt. Col. Oscar Gomez Cifuentes. \'93 False positives\'94
 are killings of civilians falsely reported by military units as \'93positive\'94 killings of guerrillas in combat. These killings increased dramatically in Colombia in both scale and frequency between 2002 and 2008. Both Cabuya de Le\'f3
n and Gomez Cifuentes were removed by ICE in 2017, following an investi
gation by ICE HSI aided by the expertise of the Center. In some cases, evidence from criminal proceedings in a foreign country has been key to litigating cases in the United States. Enrique Ariza Rivas was a former director of intelligence in Colombia
\rquote s no
w dissolved Administrative Department of Security (DAS). He had been charged in Colombia with aggravated psychological torture of a journalist and various other crimes relating to unlawful wiretapping. Documents obtained from the Colombian government were
 used in ICE\rquote 
s immigration case. ICE ultimately removed Enrique Ariza Rivas to Colombia in April 2017. A final set of cases I would like to mention underscores the role United States courts play in seeking accountability for human rights abuses committed ab
road, as well as in the broader efforts of justice and atrocities prevention. Jose Ortiz Morales is a former member of a Guatemalan Special Forces military unit known as the Kaibiles that indiscriminately killed more than 200 men, women, and children in 

\par 7a massacre in the Guatemalan hamlet of Las Dos Erres in December 1982. In September 2017, Morales was sentenced to 11.5 months incarceration for violating 18 U.S.C. \'a7
1425 (unlawfully procuring, or attempting to procure, naturalization or citizenship) follo
wing an investigation by HSI Baltimore and the Center. Morales, who has been indicted in Guatemala for his alleged participation in these war crimes, is the fifth Las Dos Erres target identified and investigated by ICE. The other perpetrators investigated
 by ICE HSI include Gilberto Jordan, featured in the 2016 documentary film, Finding Oscar andJorge Vinicio Sosa Orantes. Both men were sentenced to 10 years incarceration for violating 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 1425 (unlawfully procuring, or attempting to procure, natura
lization or citizenship) and both remain imprisoned today. These successes were a team effort, with ICE and HRSP in partnership with the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Southern District of Florida and the Central District of California. ICE deported two a
d
ditional perpetrators, Pedro Pimentel Rios in 2011 and Santos Lopez Alonzo in 2016. Pimentel Rios was convicted in Guatemala in 2012 for his participation in theLas Dos Erres massacre and sentenced to 6,060 years; Lopez Alonzo was convicted in Guatemala i
n
 2018 and sentenced to 5,160 years. Despite these convictions, we remain concerned about efforts in Guatemala and El Salvador to grant amnesty to human rights violators that could result in the release of these convicted war criminals, and/or the suspensi
o
n of on-going investigations and trials such as the trial of Garcia Merino for his involvement in the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador.Today, ICE is investigating more than 1,600 human rights-related cases in part due to resources allocated by Congress s
p
ecifically to further the work of the Center. These cases are at various stages of investigation and litigation, including removal proceedings. They involve suspects from approximately 95 countries, primarily in Central and South America, the Balkans, and
 
Africa. ICE HSI has more than 170 active human rights investigations, which could ultimately support criminal charges or removal proceedings. Since 2003, the attorneys in ICE OPLA have obtained final removal orders and in ICE ERO have successfully removed
 
more than 990 known or suspected human rights violators. HRT3 has issued more than 75,000 records of suspected human rights violators for individuals from more than 110 countries. Over 300 suspected human rights violators have been prevented from entering
 
the United States based on these records through either visa revocations or visa refusals by DOS or by stops at ports of entry by CBP officers. The Center continues to grow and expand its mission. To identify proactively perpetrators of modern-day atrocit
ies, HRT3 is developing the \'93War Crimes Hunter\'94
 database, a photo-based database of suspected human rights violators who have actively participated in human rights abuses. The Center anticipates that HRT3 will utilize open source media sites to download ima
ges and video files of alleged perpetrators in current conflict zones and then, working with other governmental partners, cross-references the images with governmentalbiometric databases to determine whether these alleged perpetrators can be identified. I
C
E is working with oversight offices to ensure that this program is implemented consistent with legal, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties requirements.Additionally, the Center is developing prevention records and potential leads by utilizing informa
tion received from civil society and NGOs regarding human rights abuses and atrocities committed by the Syrian Regime, and other non-state actors, during the Syrian Revolution. 
\par 8The Center\rquote s FGM response team works closely with federal, state, and foreign 
law enforcement partners, as well as child protective officials, non-profit organizations, medical and educational professionals, and survivors, to protect young girls by investigating cases offemale genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and conducting outre
a
ch and training to end the practice. FGM/C is a serious human rights abuse, a form of gender-based violence, and, when done to children, a serious form of child abuse. ICE HSI and the FBI jointly investigate violations of the federal criminal FGM statute,
 18 U.S .C . \'a7
 116. On April 12, 2017, Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, a United States citizen and Detroit-area doctor, was indicted by a federal grand jury for performing FGM/C on at least two 7-year old girls, the first indictment to charge a violation under 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 116. In November 2019, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed the counts related to 18 U.S.C. \'a7 116(a), finding that Congress lacked Constitutional authority to enact the FGM statute as written. In addition to
 utilizing our authorities to investigate cases of FGM/C, ICE HSI and ICE OPLA also use the provisions of the INA to prevent and deter FGM/C when possible. In at least two instances, FGM/C was prevented after parents suspected of trying to send their daug
h
ters overseas for FGM/C were interviewed by ICE HSI and FBI and notified about U.S. laws and the potential consequences of subjecting their daughters to this form of child abuse. In 2017, the Center and HSI New York launched an FGM/C-related outreach prog
r
am called Operation Limelight USA. Operation Limelight USA aims to safeguard and prevent young girls from being subjected to FGM/C by educating airline passengers about the potential harms of FGM/C and United States laws governing the practice. The Operat
i
on utilizes specially-trained teams, consisting of ICE HSI special agents, CBP officers, and NGOs, to initiate informal discussions about United States laws with families traveling to or from regions where FGM/C is prevalent and to provide them with educa
tional materials about the harms of the practice. This summer t he Center plans to expand Operation Limelight USA to 14 airports around the United States. The Center\rquote 
s Global Magnitsky (GloMag) Regional Support Team, created in 2018, leverages agency enforc
ement powers pertaining to illicit trade and money laundering activitiesto identify foreign persons who are responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, or who have committed acts o
f
 corruption. Once identified, the GloMag team works with our colleagues at the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and State to recommend individuals and entities upon whom the President may impose sanctions. One of the first individuals sanctioned under th
e
 Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act was Slobodan Tesic, whom ICE HSI identified following a lengthy investigation. Tesic provided bribes and financial assistance to officials to secure arms contracts and spent nearly a decade on the United N
a
tions (UN) Travel Ban List for violating UN sanctions against arms exports to Liberia; he was among the biggest dealers of arms and munitions in the Balkans. As the Center grows and its mission expands, assistance from our international partners remains a
 
key component in successful human rights-related investigations and prosecutions. The Center reciprocates the support it receives whenever possible to further the global fight against impunity for human rights abusers. It maintains strong working relation
s
hips with several dozen local, regional, and international organizations who share our commitment to pursuing accountability for atrocities. Our relationships with a number of UN-sponsored tribunals include the International Residual Mechanism for Crimina

n rights-related agencies in Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Finland, Germany, Guatemala, Peru, Rwanda, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. We maintain an even wider network of international partners through our coordination with INTERPOL, EUR
OPOL, and EUROJUST, the European Union\rquote s (EU) network of prosecutors. The Center regularly participates in EUROJUST\rquote 
s biannual Genocide Network meeting at The Hague to discuss investigations and prosecutions of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against human
ity. Prosecutors and investigators from the EU, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada discuss and share c urrent crime bases, investigations, and best practices. Our successes, and our ongoing daily efforts, underscore the Center\rquote 
s deep commitm
ent to denying human rights violators safe haven in the United States using all of the legal authorities available. While we acknowledge and celebrate our collaborative work to date, weunderstand that much remains to be done. While the INA bars individual
s
 who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in a broad range of persecution from receiving certain forms of lawful immigration status such as asylee or refugee status, there is no specific immigration charge under which an individual can be
 
prevented from entering, or be removed from, the United States for engaging in acts of persecution. Similarly, there is no specific ground of inadmissibility or removability for those who participate in crimes against humanity, war crimes, or in FGM/C. Th
e
refore, some of these individuals still may be admissible to the United States and eligible for other forms of immigration benefits, including business or tourist visas or status through a family member or an employer. To obtain visas and enter the United
 States, many human rights violators perpetrate fraud against the United States during the application process. The statute of limitations for 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 1546 (immigration fraud) is five years, although the statute of limitations for related crimes such as 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 1425 (naturalization fraud) is 10 years. Unless this fraud is exposed within five years, the Center is confronted with a serious obstacle to prosecution. Title 18 U.S.C. \'a7 2441 (war crimes) carries a five-year statute of limitations when the v
iolation does not result in death. Title 18 U.S.C. \'a7
 2340A ( torture) carries an 8-year statute of limitations if the acts did not result in death or serious bodily injury or the foreseeable risk of such. In many instances, the United States government mus
t forgo criminal charges because evidence of the offender\rquote 
s misrepresentations did not come to light within the statute of limitations. Over the past 25 years, the United States has sheltered over a million refugees fleeing armed conflict, violent oppressi
on, persecution, and torture. I recognize the unique responsibility our agency bears to protect those who come to our country to escape their perpetrators. By pursuing accountability for past atrocities, we believe the Center contributes to the urgent wor
k
 of preventing future atrocities and ensures the United States is not a safe haven for human rights violators. Co-Chairmen McGovern and Smith, I applaud your continued leadership on these important issues. Thank you again for the opportunity to address th
is Commission, and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.

untries are actively implementing a multitude of schemes to illicitly or subversively acquire and transfer export- controlled military and dual use technology and commodities, and are employing myriad schemes to circumvent U.S. export control laws. Exploi
t
ation of academia and U.S. research institutions is just one of the schemes these countries are employing to obtain access to sensitive research and export-controlled information and technology, and to facilitate its transfer abroad. These countries are a
t
tempting to obtain this information, in many instances in an illegal or subversive manner, in order to advance their own military capabilities or economic goals, many times in contravention to the national security of the United States. Foreign nationals 
f
rom China, Iran, and Russia represent a sizeable portion of the overall nonimmigrant student population currently in the United States. As of May 2019, there are 357,863 F-1 Chinese students in the United States with 181,980 such students enrolled in STEM
-
related academic programs at U.S. institutions. There are also 11,323 F-1 Iranian students and 6,196 F-1 Russian students, with the respective STEM student breakdown of 9,057 for Iran and 2,008 for Russia. HSI Efforts to Identify and Mitigate the Threat H
SI has established a multi-dimensional approach to safeguarding the Homeland against transnational threats of this nature. HSI\rquote 
s first line of effort is preventative, and aims to identify and disrupt the ability of known or suspected national security or pu
blic safety threats from obtaining nonimmigrant visas to lawfully travel to, and obtain entry into, the United States. A core component of this effort is the HSI-led Visa Security Program (VSP). Through the VSP, HSI analysts and special agents work in con
j
unction with U.S. interagency and foreign government partners to maximize the opportunity to screen, vet, and investigate potential threatsprior to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) making a visa determination and well before the applicant presents for a
dmission to the United States. This includes those applying for student or exchange visitor visas. If sufficient derogatory information is uncovered relating to the intentions of visa applicants, HSI \endash  working in conjunction with DOS \endash 
 can recommend refusin
gvisas on a number of grounds, including for suspected involvement in the illicit procurement or attempted procurement of controlled technology. In addition to these preventative measures, HSI also implements multiple programs to identify and protect agai
n
st foreign entities already in the United States who may seek to exploit legitimate academic and research opportunities for the ultimate benefit of adversarial state actors. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) fulfills a compliance-centric rol
e
, and is responsible for monitoring certified educational institutions and the nonimmigrant students they enroll. The Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU) coordinates investigative and enforcement actions in cases in which nonimmigrant 
v
isa holders, including students and exchange visitors, overstay their visas or violate the terms of their visas and are suspected of posing a concern to U.S. national security or public safety. If students or exchange visitors appear to be involved in eff
orts to acquire and transfer sensitive information or technology 
\par 3obtained during the course of their research or academic pursuits, HSI\rquote s CPI plays a role incoordinating an investigative and enforcement response to those activities. Together, these programs form the backbone of HSI\rquote 
s efforts to identify and mitigate the threats posed by foreign entities seeking to exploit legitimate academic and research oppor
tunities within the United States. Each of these programs is described in more detail below. HSI Visa Security Program:The HSI VSP leverages resources in the United States and abroad to screen and vet non-immigrant visa applicants, identify and prevent th
e
 travel of those who constitute potential national security or public safety concerns, and launch investigations into transnational criminal-and terrorist-affiliated networks operating around the globe. The VSP was formed in response to the September 11, 
2
001 attacks, authorized by Section 428 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002and implemented by a 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security. Currently, HSI VSP operations are conducted at 36 visa-issuing posts i
n
 27 countries. In FY 2018, VSP screened 2,196,708 visa applications, made 1,251 nominations or enhancements to the terrorist watchlist, and recommended the refusal of 9,007 visa applications. Additionally, deployed special agents conducted 5,101 interview
s
 and initiated 348 investigations in support of VSP operations. One key facet of VSP operations is the overseas assignment of HSI Special Agents to diplomatic posts worldwide. Embedded within American Embassies and Consulates, these agents work alongside 
D
OS Consular Affairs personnel, other partner agencies at post, and appropriate host country officials to identify and investigate terrorists, criminals, or other individuals who pose a threat to the United States. A second critical component to VSP is the
 
Pre-Adjudicated Threat Recognition Intelligence Operations Team (PATRIOT), administered by HSI International Operations (IO) in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which conducts centralized screening and vetting in the National C

pital Region (NCR) in support of VSP operations. PATRIOT enables the automated screening of visa application information against DHS holdings, as well as holdings of other U.S. agencies, at the earliest point in the visa process, well in advance of the vi
sa applicant\rquote 
s interview and visa adjudication. Derogatory information discovered during automated screening process is manually vetted by PATRIOT personnel utilizing law enforcement techniques, open source information, and classified systems.PATRIOT analys
ts then provide HSI Special Agents assigned to VSP posts with relevant information to use during interviews of visa applicants or other investigative activities conducted abroad prior to visa adjudication. Following the analysis of all known derogatory in
f
ormation, HSI Special Agents at VSP posts provide a unified DHS recommendation to DOS on visa eligibility. In addition to the PATRIOT process, VSP personnel also participate in other U.S. government screening and vetting efforts focused on protecting the 
Homeland from diverse national security and public safety threats. Generally, these processes entail collaboration between HSI, DOS, and other partner agencies involved in screening and vetting. This includes 
\par 4conducting intensive reviews of visa applications from visa-issuing posts worldwide that are considered high risk for the applicant\rquote 
s potential involvement in the unlawful procurement, transfer, or export of sensitive military or dual-use U.S. information and technology. At times, these applications m
ay involve individuals seeking to exploit the U.S. educational system by enrolling in graduate level studies or engaging in research, teaching, or exchange programs as a way to acquire and transfer sensitive, export-controlled technology or information on
 behalf of adversaries or organizations that pose a national security risk to the United States. In some instances, a more intensive screening and vetting of a visa application is prompted by risk factors indicative of a visa applicant\rquote 
s potential involveme
nt in activities related to the unlawful procurement, transfer, or export of sensitive U.S.-origin military or dual-use goods or technology on behalf of foreign adversaries or criminal organizations. After such reviews, VSP personnel then provide consular
 
officers advice and background information to properly adjudicate immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applications of security or foreign policy interest. Whether through the PATRIOT process or other screening and vetting efforts in which the VSP is engaged, 
t
he VSP ultimately provides recommendations for visa issuance or refusal toDOS based on information uncovered during the review, vetting, and investigative process. In all cases where the VSP team recommends the refusal of a visa, the VSP coordinates in ad
vance with CBP\rquote s National Targeting Center-Passenger (NTC-P) regarding the applicant\rquote 
s admissibility or inadmissibility, per the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This ensures that DHS presents a single, uniform position on visa eligibility and admissi
bility to DOS. The combination of the international and domestic dimensions of VSP equips HSI with a unique capability to investigate suspicious travelers, enhance existing information, and identify previously unknown threats, rather than simply denying v
i
sas and potential travel of these applicants. These efforts allow VSP to operate as a counterterrorism tool that mitigates threats posed by transnational terrorist and criminal networks. Utilizing information obtained through the visa application process,
 
the VSP enhances the national security and border security of the United States by identifying national security or public safety concerns at the earliest part of the visa lifecycle and preventing their travel to and admission into the United States.HSI S
t
udent and Exchange Visitor Program: Foreign nationals who receive nonimmigrant visas to pursue educational, vocational, or research programs in the United States will interact with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). As of May 2019, there are
 
1,139,571 nonimmigrant students attending 6,410 SEVP-certified schools.SEVP uses the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to monitor F and M students and the schools that enroll them while in the United States. SEVIS also contains the i
nformation for the Exchange Visitor program (J-visas), which is administered by DOS. SEVIS contains information such as a student\rquote 
s name, physical and mailing addresses, date of birth, phone number, email address, academic major, and employment information 
(if applicable). SEVIS information is updated by Designated School Officials (DSOs), but the system will auto-terminate a student\rquote s record if the student fails to enroll or report to school, 
\par 5meaning the student must depart the United States or he or she 
may be put into removal proceedings. SEVP is also responsible for the school certification process. The certification process is rigorous and continual. To obtain initial certification, schools must submit required evidence andapplications, undergo site v
i
sits, and recommend DSOs. These school officials must be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents and must affirm their knowledge and intent to comply with all federal regulations. The schools are furthermore subject to biennial recertification, unanno
u
nced site visits and out-of-cycle reviews at any time. Schools that do not comply with the regulations may be withdrawn and, subsequently, ineligible to enroll nonimmigrant students until successfully re-petitioning for approval and meeting all certificat
i
on standards. Beyond the certification process, SEVP uses SEVIS data to engage in risk management and has enhanced its risk management framework by developing a compliance dashboard toidentify schools with risk indicators. SEVP employs this risk analysis 
t
ool to identify schools that may have violated SEVP regulations when conducting recertification reviews, adjudicating school updates, and determining whether to initiate out-of-cycle reviews. SEVP regularly conducts compliance site visits to schools to en
s
ure that approved programs are functioning as reported in SEVIS. In addition, SEVP continuously vets leads reported by the public concerning both schools and students, acting decisively to protect public safety and the integrity of the immigration system.
 While many of SEVP\rquote 
s processes and programs have proven to be effective, HSI strives to improve and enhance these programs. For example, SEVP has mitigated previously identified national security gaps and system vulnerabilities within SEVIS and is using an
 adaptive maintenance approach to continuously add enhancements to the system. These enhancements have improved data integrity and the stability of the system. SEVP is currently working towards transforming SEVIS into a person-centric database. In March 2
018, SEVP launched the SEVP Portal for students participating in Optional Practical Training (OPT) related to STEM degrees. The Portal allows nonimmigrant students to directly upload their required SEVIS information, including their employer\rquote 
s name and addr
ess, as well as other key information for monitoring purposes. The portal interfaces with SEVIS and shares information but does not give students direct access to SEVIS. The Portal has been a success with more than 166,402 registered portal users (i.e., 7
4.7 percent of the students eligible for Portal Accounts). The portal will be expanded to all F and M students, resulting in SEVIS data that is more accurate, captures changes in a student\rquote 
s information quicker and ensures students are accountable for the d
ata inputted. Additionally, SEVP started conducting criminal background checks on proposed DSOs in May 2017, due to the fact that these individuals have access to a secure government database and a role in reporting information in that database. HSI is ac
tively working to expand this process and incorporate such vetting as part of its regular review of approved schools and DSOs, both to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities and to ensure the integrity of the information in SEVIS. SEVP\rquote 
s current programs, ongoing enhancements, and proposed expansion will further secure our nation from those wishing to exploit the nation\rquote 
s education system. For more information about the privacy risks that HSI takes on while operating SEVP and the subsequent 
\par 6mitigations, please view the SEVIS privacy impact assessment (PIA) and subsequent updates available at www.dhs.gov/privacy. HSI Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit: HSI\rquote 
s CTCEU actively identifies and initiates enforcement action on nonimmigrant visa ove
rstay violators, and works closely with SEVP and CPI to ensure leads and other information related to potential status violators are referred to HSI field offices for appropriate action. Within the agency, CTCEU focuses on overstay violators who pose a na
t
ional security, border security, or public safety concern. This includes individuals who entered the United States as nonimmigrant students or exchange visitors. CTCEU leverages special agents, analysts, information systems, and interagency partnerships t
o determine viable national security related overstay leads to pursue. In an average year, CTCEU analyzes over one million potential status violator records, incorporating data from various government systems, such as SEVIS and CBP\rquote 
s Arrival and Departure I
nformation System (ADIS). CTCEU conducts both batch and manual vetting against government databases, public indices, and open source information. The vetting helps determine whether an individual who overstayed has departed the United States, adjusted to 
a
 lawful status, has a pending immigration benefit application, or would be appropriate for an enforcement action.CTCEU proactively develops cases for investigation, monitors the latest threat reports, and addresses emergent issues. This practice is design
e
d to detect and identify individuals and schools exhibiting specific risk factors; it is formulated based on intelligence reporting, travel patterns, and in-depth criminal research and analysis. It has contributed to the counterterrorism mission by initia
t
ing and supporting high-priority national security initiatives, based on specific intelligence. CTCEU considers several fraud indicators when reviewing schools, such as a high volume of students engaged in OPT or Curriculum Practical Training (CPT), low c
o
mpletion rates, over-enrolled schools with student populations exceeding indicated I-17 amount, schools receiving Federal funding for sensitive research, or schools exhibiting various other fraud indicators. CTCEU also reviews SEVP Analysis Operation Cent
e
r (SAOC) Tip Logs and HSI Tip Line information to further enhance or corroborate information received on schools or school officials. LeadTrac is the database owned by CTCEU and is used to vet and manage leads pertaining to visitors in the United States w
ho are suspected of overstaying their period of admission or otherwise violating the terms of their admission, as well as organizations suspected of immigration violations. LeadTrac\rquote 
s structure supports a subject-centered data model, ensuring multiple leads
 about a single subject are linked within the system. For more information about the privacy risks that HSI CTCEU takes on while operating LeadTrac and the subsequent mitigations, please view the LeadTrac PIA available at www.dhs.gov/privacy. In FY 2018, 
CTCEU reviewed 1,429,395 leads regarding potential overstays. Numerous leads were closed through an automated screening process, most commonly due to subsequent departure from the United States. A total of 8,968 leads were sent to HSI field offices for 

\par 7in
vestigation. Of these, 2,212 were pending further investigation, 2,795 were closed for being in compliance (pending immigration benefit application, granted asylum, approved adjustment of status application, or departed the United States) and the remainin
g
 leads were returned to CTCEU for continuous vetting and further investigation. In FY 2018 alone, HSI made 1,808 arrests pursuant to visa violator leads. In FY 2019 through March 31, 2019, CTCEU has reviewed 765,543 leads regarding potential overstays and
 
sent 4,940 leads to HSI field offices for further investigation. HSI has made 1,025 arrests pursuant to visa violator leads in FY 2019. CTCEU refers leads that do not meet HSI criteria for further investigation to ICEEnforcement and Removal Operations (ER
O
) National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center(NCATC) which works in close coordination with CTCEU for further vetting. If necessary, the lead is forwarded to the respective ERO field office for enforcement action. Key Initiatives on Overstay Enforceme
ntOutreach is an important component of CTCEU\rquote s operations. HSI special agents have been conducting outreach visits to SEVP-certified institutions as part of HSI\rquote 
s Project Campus Sentinel (PCS) program. This outreach program, which was established in 2011, 
aims to build a mutual partnership between local HSI special agents and SEVP-certified institutions by collaboratively preventing the criminal exploitation of SEVP through direct and open communication. It furthermore creates an avenue for improved direct
 
communication between DSOs and local HSI special agents. In recent years, this outreach program has been expanded to include SEVP Field Representatives and Campus Public Safety entities. This partnership provides all stakeholders the opportunity to openly
 exchange information, improve cooperation, and bolster the safety and security of students, faculty, and institutions. Since inception, HSI special agents have conducted over 4,000 PCS outreaches.Other key initiatives in HSI\rquote 
s overstay enforcement efforts 
include the Domestic Mantis and Visa Lifecycle programs. The Domestic Mantis and Visa Lifecycle programs help identify nonimmigrant students who have access to sensitive technology, better capture the overarching visa lifecycle, provide another layer of s
e
curity for the nation, and serve as innovative investigative tools to support the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. CTCEU developed the Domestic Mantis Program in response to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) assessment that identified a potent
i
al vulnerability with nonimmigrant students who enter the United States to study in a non-sensitive field of study and subsequently transfer to a sensitive field of study. These individuals could pose a substantial risk related to the diversion of sensiti
v
e technology, materials, or information. The Domestic Mantis Program aims to enhance national security by preventing the exportof goods, technology, or sensitive information through activities such as graduate-level studies, teaching, research, training, 
o
r employment. The program works by identifying students that have changed their field of study to a sensitive area and evaluates those individuals against risk-based targeting criteria. To accomplish this, CTCEU manually extracts and reviews SEVIS data pe
rtaining to students from countries that have an elevated risk of proliferation activity. The potential leads are analyzed using a comprehensive vetting process, including a review against 
\par 8Intelligence Community holdings for additional 
derogatory information, open source information, and academic journals. These Domestic Mantis checks are performed twice a yearto identify new students who enroll at varying times within the school year.Visa Lifecycle ProgramThe Visa Lifecycle Program tra
cks nonimmigrant visitors from the time they file visa applications to the time they depart from the United States, become overstays, or otherwise fail to comply with their terms of admission (i.e., become \'93out-of-status\'94
). This program allows HSI to contin
uously vet and identify derogatory information on nonimmigrant visitors for the validity of the visa. In instances where violators are identified, appropriate enforcement actions are initiated. The Visa Lifecycle Program focuses on nonimmigrants seeking b
u
siness/tourist (i.e., B1/B2) or student/exchange (i.e., F, J, and M) visas from five DOS visa issuing posts. These posts were selected to complement existing HSI screening efforts in response to recent global acts of terrorism perpetrated in those countri
es. Working in coordination with HSI\rquote 
s VSP, CTCEU receives information on these visa applicants pulled from PATRIOT and the DOS Consular Consolidated Database (CCD). CTCEU ingests this data into its lead management system and continuously vets these nonimmi
grant visa holders using an automated open source vetting platform in conjunction with Intelligence Community holdings. HSI Counter P roliferation Investigations Program:Cases involving the attempted acquisition and transfer of sensitive, export-controlle
d
 commodities, technology, or information fall within the purview of the HSI CPI program. HSI is designated as the primary law enforcement agency for investigating violations of U.S. export laws related to military items, controlled dual-use goods, and san
ctioned/embargoed countries. HSI, through its CPI p rogram, has statutory authority to investigate violations of U.S. export control laws , and is uniquely equipped \endash 
 as the only agency enforce with border search authority, undercover authority, forfeiture authority, and an extensive international footprint \endash 
 to combat the trafficking of weapons and technology, to include chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear materials, and other items required to produce weapons of mass destruction (WMD). HSI\rquote s CPI mi
ssion is directly aligned with U.S. national security and defense strategies, as they pertain to protecting the American war fighter and the Homeland from having sensitive U.S.-origin military and WMD technology fall into the hands of U.S. adversaries; se
c
uring the U.S. border from firearms being smuggled to transnational criminal organizations; disrupting the supply chains of illicit procurement networks by preventing terrorist groups and hostile nations from acquiring U.S. military hardware, firearms, se
nsitive technical data, dual-use technology, and materials used to develop weapons of mass destruction; protecting U.S. industry from sensitive intangible technology transfers; and keeping U.S. industry\rquote 
s intellectual property, as well as ground breaking research and development, from being exploited by U.S. adversaries.
\par 9HSI, and its predecessor agency, the U.S. Customs Service, has been exercising its export enforcement authority for over 100 years. Although other federal law enforcement, regulatory, intel
ligence, and military agencies are involved in the overall U.S. export control efforts, HSI is empowered with full statutory authority to investigate violations of all U.S. export control laws, such as the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and International 
T
raffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); the Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECRA) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR); theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); and Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). From 2012 to 2018, HSI CPI investigat
i
ons have resulted in over 17,000 cases initiated, 4,006 arrests, and 8,288 seizures. U.S. export control laws are comprehensive and include restrictions on tangible exports (i.e ., the actual shipment of items from the U.S.), intangible exports (i.e., the
 
transmission oftechnical data from the United States, or transfer to foreign nationals within the United States), re-exports and transshipments (i.e ., exports from one foreign country to another), and controls on services and other business activities (i
.
e., training, brokering, and financing services). Because of the complexity of U.S. export control laws and the multiple licensing agencies involved, HSI CPI special agents conduct outreach visits and provide presentations to private industry and academic
 
institutions. This program, known as Project Shield America (PSA), is designed to increase public awareness of export control laws and regulations, and to equip private industry and the academic community with the knowledge needed to aid in recognition, d
e
tection, and resolution of attempted illegal acquisitions of sensitive, export-controlled goods and technology. Since 2001, HSI special agents have conducted more than 32,000 PSA outreach presentations, resulting in successful HSI criminal investigations 
w
orldwide. Currently, the United States is facing an unprecedented threat from foreign governments, such as Iran, China, and Russia, who have launched far-reaching campaigns to illicitly acquire sensitive, and in some cases export-controlled, commodities, 
technology, research, and/or information needed to further their strategic military and economic goals. One area targeted by these state actors is academia. These adversarial nations take advantage of academic openness in the name of \'93
fundamental research\'94 
to target U.S. institutions of higher learning to capture U.S. technology, processes, and other intellectual property. This process is generally labeled non-traditional collection. In the context of academia, this entails foreign adversaries facilitating 
o
r supporting academic research and expertise development in sensitive fields by student and exchange visitor nonimmigrant visa holders. Through this process, these students and researchers acquire, export, or transfer information or technology to foreign 
e
ntities in a subversive manner and without licenses, if the information or technology is export controlled. These activities pose a threat to U.S. national security and compromise the integrity of the U.S. academic and research system.To mitigate this thr
e
at, HSI has recently taken proactive steps to increase outreach to export control officers and other officials within the academic community, particularly at universities or research institutions with large foreign student populations enrolled in STEM-rel
a
ted programs. These outreach efforts are conducted in conjunction with SEVP and CTCEU representatives. The goal of this increased focus on academia outreach is to raise awareness of the potential proliferation risk posed by students and researchers seekin
g to acquire and transfer sensitive research, technology, and/or intellectual property (some of which may be export
\par 10controlled) on behalf of foreign governments or sanctioned entities. This initiative also aims to enhance the capacity of academic institut
ions to recognize potential instances of potential illicit procurement, intellectual property theft, or other possible violations of U.S. laws, and to provide a conduit to report any suspicious activities detected by universities or research institutes. W
h
ile raising awareness within the U.S. academic sector and the private sector is an important step, HSI is also making a concerted effort to prevent the acquisition and transfer of technology by foreign nationals through non-traditional collection means. T
o
 that end, HSI hasinitiated efforts to combine and coordinate resources and information available to CPI, CTCEU, SEVP, and VSP in a joint effort to identify, investigate, and prevent destination-controlled technology and export-controlled technology trans
f
ers out of the United States that violate U.S. laws and/or weaken the U.S. technological advantage in key fields. This effort will focus on the role foreign students, primarily from sensitive countries, studying at U.S. universities and colleges play in t
hese activities, and will aim to utilize the full breadth of HSI\rquote 
s administrative and criminal authorities to combat the threat posed by these foreign actors.HSI is committed to free and open academic environment, but this must be balanced against national 
security measures; if not, these institutions will be taken advantage of and critical U.S. technology and research can be acquired easily by adversaries. ConclusionIn closing, mindful of the United States\rquote 
 historical role in the development of critical tec
hnology in coordination with foreign partners and U.S. academic institutions, HSI remains committed to maintaining a free and open academic environment within the United States; however, this must be balanced with an appropriate focus on national security
 
and public safety. The threat posed by adversarial nation-states illegally and subversively seeking to exploit legitimate educational and research opportunities in the United States, many of which are funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars, is real, and the Un
i
ted States must continue to pursue all appropriate means to combat it. HSI will continue to work with academia, law enforcement partners, and other agency partners, to use its extensive administrative and criminal authorities to identify and disrupt theac
t
ivities of individuals or organizations who seek to harm the United States in this arena and the multitude of others in which HSI is engaged. HSI is well positioned to mitigate this threat through the many programs highlighted today, all of which provide 
a
 multi-layered level of security aimed at protecting the Homeland from illicit transnational activities of its adversaries. From the preventative angle of the VSP, to the compliance focus of SEVP, and through the investigative and enforcement programs exe
c
uted by the CTCEU and CPI programs, HSI is and will continue to be engaged in countering this critical problem. Enhancements and expansion of these programs, combined with enhanced administrative and criminal enforcement authorities, will only improve HSI
\rquote s ability to identify and thwart the efforts of foreign actors who pose national security or public safety concerns to the United States. HSI looks forward to continuing to work with the Committee regarding these HSI programs.

As the Department changes its tactics and techniques, or introduces new technology and infrastructure, the Cartels adapt their operations and probe our border security to determine the best way to accomplish their goals. Land Ports of Entry At POEs along 
t
he Southwest land border, smugglers use a wide variety of tactics and techniques for concealing drugs. Our special agents work every day with CBP officers from the Office of Field Operations to identify, seize, and investigate drug smuggling organizations
 
that attempt to exploit POEs to introduce drugs into the United States. Within the POE environment, there are three distinct threat areas exploited by the Cartels: Pedestrians; POVs; and Commercial Cargo. Pedestrians are primarily used to smuggle cocaine,
 
heroin and methamphetamine on or within their bodies. POVs are used to smuggle cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, and marijuana, often using deep concealment methods like non-factory compartments, gas tanks and other voids. At Commercial POEs, th
e
 Cartels utilize commercial tractor trailers to commingle narcotics with legitimate commercial goods or to conceal the narcotics within the tractor trailers themselves.The Cartels also use spotters/scouts and counter-surveillance techniques both at and be
t
ween the POEs in order to increase their chances of success in smuggling ventures. Spotters/scouts watch and report on law enforcement activities at the border. Between the Ports of EntryThe Cartels use the areas between the POEs primarily to smuggle mari
juana in bulk. In these areas, the Cartels use a variety of techniques that are tailored to the terrain and other 
\par 7environmental factors. In Texas, the Rio Grande River creates a natural barrier that poses unique challenges for both the Cartels and the U.S
. Border Patrol. Outside of urban areas along the land border, one tactic used by the Cartels is vehicle incursions, or \'93drive-throughs,\'94
 whereby smugglers breach the border by either going over or through border fences. Smugglers move vehicles over the fe
nce using ramps or, on more rare occasions, lift vehicles over the fence using cranes. Going through the fence involves cutting fence panels and lifting them up or creating a gate in the fence allowing a vehicle to pass through. Vehicle incursions often r
ely on networks of scouts that are staged on the area\rquote 
s highest points to warn them of U.S. Border Patrol or other law enforcement presence. In areas where the Cartels cannot conduct vehicle incursions, they have experimented with ways to throw or launch ma
rijuana bundles over the fence to co-conspirators waiting in the United States. Recently, we have seen Cartel attempts to use air or propane cannons to launch bundles of marijuana weighing more than a hundred pounds over the border fence. Another tactic C
a
rtels use in remote areas between the POEs is to have backpackers carry bundles of marijuana on their backs using improvised backpacks made of burlap or other materials. Backpackers often travel in groups and have been known to travel for days before gett
i
ng to pre-designated locations where other members of the organization in the United States pick them up. Smuggling by general aviation aircraft from Mexico has not been a significant threat since the late 1990s; however, in the last decade, we have seen 
t
he Cartels experiment with the use of ultralight aircraft to smuggle marijuana in Arizona and eastern California. More recently, we have also seen the Cartels experiment with the use of small recreational drones to smuggle very small quantities of drugs, 
often just a couple of pounds. 
\par 8In 1990, the first cross-border tunnel was discovered in Douglas, Arizona. Since that time, 243 tunnels (both completed and in progress) have been located along the Southwest Border, primarily in Arizona and Southern Califor
nia. The discovery of illicit subterranean tunnels is evidence that smugglers are moving away from traditional smuggling techniques due to enhanced law enforcement efforts. In recognition of the significant smuggling threat present in Arizona and San Dieg
o
, ICE leads two Tunnel Task Forces in San Diego and Nogales under the auspices of the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) Program, described in more detail below.Maritime Smuggling As infrastructure, technology, and staffing have been added to t
he border in the San Diego area, we have seen an increase in maritime smuggling of marijuana from Mexico to California coastal areas north of San Diego. The Cartels use pleasure boats or small commercial fishing vessels known as \'93Pangas\'94
 that are able to ac
hieve relatively high speeds under the cover of darkness to attempt to evade detection by CBP and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) surface patrol vessels and patrol aircraft. CorruptionOne of the major factors allowing the Cartels to sustain their existence and pr
o
liferate is public corruption in both Mexico and the United States. In Mexico, the Cartels rely on corrupt Mexican law enforcement and other public officials at every level of government to operate. U.S. law enforcement is not immune to corruption by the 
Cartels, who have used corrupt law enforcement officers from CBP, ICE, and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to avoid seizures and arrests.
\par 9Attacking Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs)In response to the smuggling threat alon
g the Southwest Border, we have assigned more than 1,700 special agents and 180 intelligence research specialists to our Southwest Border offices.In fiscal year (FY) 2018, HSI drug smuggling investigations conducted by the HSI Special Agents in Charge of 
f
ive Southwest border offices resulted in 4,561 criminal arrests, 3,523 indictments, 3,173 convictions, and 153 administrative immigration arrests. We continue to collaborate with our partners in federal, tribal, international law enforcement, state, and l
o
cal law enforcement agencies to identify, target, investigate, disrupt, and dismantle the Cartels. The following is a list of the various initiatives we use to combat TCOs: DHS Joint Task ForcesIn 2015, the Secretary of Homeland Security created three Joi
n
t Task Forces (JTFs) to address the smuggling threats identified in the Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan. Two of the JTFs, JTF East (JTF-E) and JTF West (JTF-W), are geographically focused task forces that concentrate on the southern land and 
m
aritime border of the United States and the approaches to our border all the way to Central and South America. HSI has provided Senior Executives to serve as the Deputy Directors of JTF-E and JTF-W, as well as staff-level support in the JTF-E and JTF-W Jo
int Staffs.ICE has been designated as the executive agent for the third Joint Task Force, Joint Task Force Investigations (JTF-I), with other DHS Components supporting. JTF-I is a joint, integrated, \'93functional\'94
 task force that has the responsibility of targeting top-tier criminal investigations and supporting JTF-E and JTF-W. The success of JTF-I in these diverse environments depends upon a high level of cooperation among HSI and our federal, state, local, 

\par 10and foreign partners in consolidating resources 
and leveraging unique international maritime authorities in combating TCOs.Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BEST) Our BEST units employ a threat-based/risk mitigation investigative task force model that recognizes the unique resources and capabili
t
ies of all participating law enforcement partners. This model enables each unit to apply a comprehensive approach to combating TCOs, while recognizing the distinctive circumstances and threats facing the various border environments, be it land borders, se
a
ports or airports. Additionally, BEST units are designed to incorporate other DHS-partner agencies, including CBP and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and are vehicles for establishing unity of effort, the cornerstone of a successful DHS 
mission. BEST units further solidify HSI\rquote 
s role as the primary investigative entity for DHS. We continue to expand the BEST program, which currently operates in 65 locations throughout the United States. BEST leverages more than 1,200 federal, state, local,
 tribal, and foreign law enforcement agents and officers representing over 200 law enforcement agencies. BEST also provides a co-located space that allows for collaboration in conducting intelligence-driven investigations aimed at identifying, disrupting,
 
and dismantling TCOs that operate in the air, land, and sea environments. In FY 2018, the BEST program nationally accounted for 5,574 criminal arrests, 1,579 administrative arrests, from which prosecutors obtained 3,205 indictments and 2,419 convictions. 
M
oney Laundering EffortsThe Cartels move illicit proceeds, hide assets, and conduct transactions globally. Among the various methods Cartels use to transfer and launder their illicit proceeds are bulk cash smuggling, Trade Based Money Laundering, funnel ac
counts and professional money launderers, 
\par 11and misuse of Money Service Businesses (MSB) and emerging payment systems. The Cartels exploit vulnerabilities in the financial system and conduct layered financial transactions to circumvent regulatory scrutiny,
 which presents difficulties for authorities attempting to distinguish between licit and illicit use of the financial system. HSI has refined our ability to target money laundering and financial violations through various techniques, to include interagenc
y
 investigations, training and capacity-building, targeted financial sanctions, and direct engagement with at-risk financial institutions and jurisdictions. U.S. Anti-Money Laundering laws and regulations impose customer identification, recordkeeping, and 
r
eporting obligations on covered financial institutions that help deter criminals from moving illicit proceeds through the financial system. These preventive measures also create valuable evidentiary trails for law enforcement to employ during an investiga
t
ion. As such, HSI has an abundance of investigative tools in our arsenal to disrupt and dismantle Cartel money laundering operations, as well as to discourage new actors from engaging in illicit activity. In furtherance of existing efforts to combat money
 
laundering operations, HSI has implemented a national program to assist field offices in their efforts to identify the means and methods used by Cartels to move, launder, and conceal illicit proceeds. This program provides investigators with funding, trai
n
ing, and specialized investigative support with an emphasis on targeting professional money launderers throughout the world. In addition to its ongoing support of field investigations, HSI continues to work with domestic and foreign law enforcement, regul
a
tory agencies, and non-governmental organizations to enhance cooperation and improve efforts to target money laundering operations and the criminal networks they support. Our National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center (BCSC), located in Burlington, Vermont, gene
rates long-term, multi-jurisdictional bulk cash investigations by analyzing incident reports 
\par 12and conducting intelligence-driven operational support to field offices. When contacted by federal, state, and local law enforcement for support, the BCSC assist
s that jurisdiction as much as possible by engaging the full scope of its law enforcement intelligence data sources and referring requests for assistance to local HSI field offices for immediate response. Since its inception in August 2009, the BCSC has i
n
itiated or substantially contributed to over 2,062 investigative leads, which have yielded 2,010 criminal arrests, 1,147 indictments, 677 state or federal convictions, and seizures of bulk cash totaling over $1.59 billion. High Intensity Drug Trafficking 
A
rea Task ForcesThe High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Program is administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and provides designated areas with federal funding to support coordinated Federal, state, local, tribal and terr
i
torial law enforcement activities that address drug trafficking threats. HSI, using its combined immigration and customs authorities, leads several HIDTA initiatives along the Southwest Border.The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Prog
r
am allows our Special Agents to partner and collaborate in investigations using our unique and far-reaching authorities to enforce and regulate the movement of carriers, persons, and commodities between the United States and other nations. We have dedicat
e
d personnel on 15 out of 16 OCDETF co-located Strike Forces. These Strike Forces logically extend the OCDETF program beyond the creation of prosecutor-led task forces that join together on case-specific efforts and then disband at the end of the investiga
tion. Now, permanent task force teams work together to conduct intelligence-driven, multi-jurisdictional operations against the continuum of priority targets. We 
\par 13also participate in the OCDETF Fusion Center, which support investigations of TCOs through i
nteragency coordination.Extraterritorial Criminal Travel Strike Force ProgramThe HSI Human Smuggling Unit is responsible for managing the Extraterritorial Criminal Travel Strike Force (ECT) program. The ECT Strike Force was created in June 2006 as a joint
 
partnership between HSI and the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) to address U.S. security risks posed by transnational human smuggling organizations. The ECT Program is designed to disrupt
 
and dismantle the international and domestic operations of human smuggling organizations, through aggressive investigation and prosecution of criminal travel networks that pose potential threats to U.S. national security and public safety. The ECT Program
 
focuses on networks meeting certain criteria, including organizations operating in specified geographic locations, prosecutorial viability, national security risk, significantly evolved methods of operation, and links with corrupt foreign government offic
i
als or organized crime.The ECT Program utilizes intelligence methodology to identify and target human smuggling organizations that meet certain criteria. Specifically, those organizations responsible for the smuggling of special interest aliens who may po
t
entially threaten U.S. national security and public safety.International Partners and Cooperation ICE HSI works closely with our federal law enforcement and international partners to disrupt and dismantle TCOs. We have 68 offices in 51 countries and are u
niquely positioned to utilize established relationships with host country law enforcement, to include the engagement of 
\par 14Transnational Criminal Investigative Units (TCIUs). These TCIUs are composed of DHS-trained host country counterparts who have the aut
hority to investigate and enforce violations of law in their respective countries. Since our law enforcement special agents working overseas do not possess general law enforcement or investigative authority in host countries, the use of these TCIUs enable
s
 ICE to promote direct action in its investigative leads and criminal prosecutionswhile respecting the sovereignty of the host country and cultivating international partnerships. These efforts, often thousands of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border in count
ries like Colombia and Panama, essentially act as an outer layer of security for our Southwest Border.Working with Mexican AuthoritiesMexico has proven to be an outstanding partner in the fight against TCOs, taking down the Cartels\rquote 
 top leadership and helping in efforts to dismantle these organizations. ICE\rquote s Attach\'e9
 Office in Mexico City is the largest ICE presence outside of the United States. ICE has coordinated the establishment of TCIUs in Mexico comprised of Mexican law enforcement officers. Through our Attach\'e9
 in Mexico City and associated sub-offices, HSI assists in efforts to combat transnational drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, human smuggling, and money laundering syndicates in Mexico. ICE Attach\'e9 personnel work daily with Mexican authorities t
o combat these transnational threats. Additionally, ICE\emdash along with other DHS Components\emdash 
actively works through the Department of State to provide training and technical assistance to our Mexican counterparts. The spirit of collaboration and joint effort be
tween DHS Components and our counterparts in Mexico is unprecedented.ConclusionThank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and for your continued support of ICE and its law enforcement mission. ICE is committed to stemming cross-border

\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 The early history of the Mississippi River
\par Commission was in large part the story of its
\par growing preoccupation with the levee system.
\par The evolution of the so-called "levees-only"
\par policy was complex in detail, but
\par comprehensible in terms of the physical and
\par political facts of life in the Mississippi flood
\par plain.
\par The first question to be faced by the newfledged
\par Commission was exactly what its own
\par functions were to be. The organic law had not
\par defined them with any degree of distinctness.
\par The law had, however, committed the MRC to
\par fix, enlarge, and deepen the channel of the
\par river-no easy task considering its size and the
\par shifting alluvial sediments in which it flowed.
\par An early and fundamental disagreement arose
\par among Commission members over whether a
\par levee system would, by oonfining the water,
\par help to scour out a deeper channel. James B.
\par Eads thought that it would; future President
\par Benjamin Harrison and the Corps' Brigadier
\par General Cyrus B. Comstock disagreed.! Hence
\par the years 1879-1881 were a time of uncertainty.
\par The Commission's only unquestioned duty was
\par to take over surveys of the river, previously
\par carried out by an Engineer board.2 While
\par Congress and the MRC's members debated the
\par effects of a levee system, the Commission also
\par began a program of channel improvement by
\par permeable contraction works and mattress
\par revetment.3 Pioneered on the}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352  middle}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par Mississippi by the Corps of Engineers, this
\par program aimed to narrow the river to an
\par approximately uniform 3,000 feet. Typical
\par works were longitudinal dikes constructed of
\par pilings with waling strips on both sides filled
\par with brush.4 Connected to the banks by
\par transverse dams, and revetted , these
\par structures were designed to produce
\par deposition, narrowing and ultimately
\par deepening the channel, as the law required.
\par Beyond these works, the Commission felt
\par considerable uncertainty about its future, its
\par duties, and the way it would function. It did not
\par want to be an executive body, yet it was obliged
\par to handle details of maintenance and
\par construction until Corps officers took on the
\par work in 188l.5 At that time, Commission
\par members still looked to the year ahead as a
\par time of experimental work dealing with
\par contraction of the river.6
\par The flood of 1882, which overwhelmed the
\par levees-and, very often, the remaining credit
\par of the levee districts as well-changed the
\par picture entirely. Alarmed by the suffering and
\par ruin in the alluvial valley, Congress decided on
\par an important change in policy. After
\par instructing the MRC to engage in flood control,
\par lawmakers had shied away from voting money
\par for levees; now they reversed themselves again,
\par by voting in ambiguous terms to allow the
\par Commission to build levees if doing so would
\par make navigation easier and safer. By decision
\par of the Secretary of War, the river below Cairo
\par was divided into four administrative districts,
\par each in charge of an officer of the Army
\par Engineers, under whose direction all work for
\par improving the river was to be carried on.7 In
\par time these District Engineers would be
\par directed to meet as a board to recommend the
\par distribution of Commission funds. The
\par Commission retained overall powers-under
\par the Secretary of War-to set policy and amend
\par the recommendations of the Board of District
\par Engineers.
\par These administrative changes gained their
\par meaning from the new national policy set by
\par Congress in the 1882 act. Not only was the
\par Commission authorized to build and repair
\par levees,8 but the act also appropriated $4.9
\par million for the Commission, and gave it charge
\par of all Federal work for improving the harbors
\par of Memphis, Vicksburg, Natchez, and New
\par Orleans, plus the rectification of the Red and
\par Atchafalaya Rivers, which had previously
\par belonged to the Memphis Engineer Office.9
\par The process of gathering of all Federal work on
\par the Mississippi into the hands of the
\par Commission advanced with this act. At the
\par same time the job of executing Commission
\par policy had been placed in the hands of the
\par Engineers. Most important of all, Congress
\par had given tacit approval to levee work,
\par provided it were properly justified.
\par Delegations from the local levee district
\par argued their cases before the Commission at its
\par meetings in August and November 1882. They
\par spoke with pathetic detail of the
\par impoverishment of their people, of their own
\par exhausted credit, and the helplessness of
\par private initiative and local government to deal
\par with the repeated disasters. Senator Lamar of
\par Mississippi-manager of the bill that created
\par the Commission-signaled the intentions of
\par levee advocates in Congress when he urged the
\par Commission to build levees first "where
\par obstructions to navigation are the greatest."
\par The point of t}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 his approach was the claim that}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par crevasses caused shoaling of the main channel.
\par Following this line, the citizens of Greenville,
\par Mississippi, argued that the caving of the
\par riverbank before their town was destroying
\par navigation by the "correspondingly rapid
\par formation and growth of the already extensive
\par sand bar upon the opposite side" of the river. A
\par petition of 11 parishes of Louisiana called the
\par Ashton crevasses "the immediate cause of bad
\par navigation at this point." On 16 August 1882
\par the Commission entered upon the work of levee
\par building. lo
\par Major Charles R. Suter of the Corps of
\par Engineers made a motion that the Commission
\par divide the river into four districts. 11 He also
\par moved that $1.5 million be allotted to the
\par levees, and, amended to $1.3 million, the
\par motion was adopted the next day, with only
\par Comstock recording himself in opposition.12
\par Suter's districting motion was then adopted.
\par The Commission, in the course of 2 days, had
\par emerged from its chrysalis and embarked
\par upon the work that was to transform middle
\par America.
\par The development of the levee system that
\par followed was marked by enormous advances in
\par technique and organization. The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 how }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 of levee
\par building was enormously advanced-when it
\par was not created from scratch-by the
\par Commission. Proper selection of levee sitesoften
\par considerably back from the river, to the
\par dismay of riparian landowners-complete
\par clearance of the soil, removal of stumps,
\par construction to specified height and cross
\par section, sodding of the levees with Bermuda
\par grass, forbidding cuts and drains, outlawing
\par the use of levees as roadways-all became
\par elements in a comprehensive set of standards
\par enforced by the Commission's power to grant
\par or withhold Federal money.13
\par Commission improvements were not
\par confined to levee building. It carried out the
\par first complete surveys of the low river, and
\par systematically studied all aspects of the
\par stream's behavior. It sponsored innovativework on revetment, adapting the willow
\par mattress for bank and levee protection.14
\par Progress in organization also marked the
\par Mississippi River Commission's work. The
\par Commission pressed for cooperative Federal
\par and state efforts in the field of flood control. Its
\par efforts resulted in the emergence of a limited
\par but coherent national policy on the Mississippi
\par backed by the best scientific information that
\par the contemporary state of the art would allow.
\par Typical was the work of the Fourth
\par Mississippi River Commission District,
\par headquartered at New Orleans. District
\par Engineers headed a complex system in which
\par river improvement was financed largely by the
\par state levee districts but guided and
\par coordinated by Federal experts. Some levees
\par were Federal, many private, but most were
\par built by the six levee districts of Lower Tensas,
\par Atchafalaya, Lafourche, Barataria,
\par Pontchartrain, and Lake Borgne with some
\par Federal assistance. Guidance came from the
\par District headquarters, originally in the New
\par Or leans Custom House but later moved to No.1
\par Prytania Street at the river. Here the District
\par Engineer, his military assistant, and a force of
\par male civilians, clerks, and assistant Engineers,
\par had their offices. All but the clerks, however,
\par spent much time in the field. Mainline levees
\par were divided into sections, and a junior or
\par senior Engineer walked each section at least
\par once a month. Levee construction was carried
\par out by prime contractors who subcontracted
\par 200- to 300-yard "station" to itinerant
\par construction men or "humpers" who often
\par worked on levees during the fall and winter
\par and on northern railroads during the summer.
\par Simplest construction method was by
\par wheelbarrow-the usual way until the 20th
\par century. More efficient were team outfits using
\par mules to drag wheeled scrapers, a method that
\par prevailed from about 1900 to 1910. Then the
\par great volumes of earth that had to be moved led
\par to development of levee machines-A-frame
\par derricks with wooden booms 50 to 75 feet long
\par at the end of which hung 2-cubic-yard orangepeel
\par buc}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 kets. As work went forward, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 machines were moved on two parallel planked}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 runways by means of skids and wooden rollers.
\par From these machines evolved steel draglines
\par with 3.5-yard buckets, and large drag scrapers
\par of 8 to 10 yards capacity. New Orleans
\par Engineers also used a locomotive crane that
\par moved upon 16-foot track sections bolted to
\par heavy frames which the crane itself raised
\par from behind and moved in front of its path of
\par operations. Levee machines continued work
\par until the appearance of mobile earth-moving
\par equipment.
\par Work on the levees was hard, "all muscle,"
\par with wages (in 1890) of $2.50 a day for a
\par "master laborer." Work gangs hired on the
\par open market rather than by contractors had
\par the benefit of superior working conditions. A
\par crew at work was a little army of 150 to 500
\par men, black and white. Most of the laborers and
\par many supervisors and skilled artisans were
\par Negroes, while other supervisors, Engineers,
\par and Army personnel were white. The men
\par lived on quarterboats while working, sleeping
\par in dormitories and devouring gargantuan
\par meals. When the river rose, even harder work
\par impended. Engineers walked the levees daily,
\par took charge of the Federal, state, and private
\par labor that swarmed out to help in the flood
\par fight, and tried to hold up under a protracted
\par strain that one officer compared to the rigors of
\par the battlefi}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 eld.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par A flood fight overrode all barriers. In time of
\par danger, the depot maintained by the New
\par Orleans Engineer Office supplied equipment,
\par while Commission Engineers coordinated the
\par work of state and private interests. In the 1897
\par flood, District Engineer Major George McC.
\par Derby counted "six independent forces which
\par assist in the work, the individual planter, the
\par railroads, the parish, the levee district, the
\par State and United States."16 A civilian assistant
\par Engineer recounted that in the Pontchartrain
\par levee district "about 95% of the supervisory
\par personnel was (sic) unpaid civilians and
\par officials of the Railroads, Levee Boards,
\par Louisian}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 a State Highway Commission, the}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par Standard Oil Company at Baton Rouge,
\par officials of the Sugar Refineries, Oil
\par Refineries, Saw Mills ... and from practically
\par every manufacturing plant and farm in the
\par district." Short sections of the levee line were
\par placed under Engineers from the Louisiana
\par Highway Commission. Planters and foremen
\par of mills turned out to supervise the work of
\par their employees on the levee, and afterward
\par submitted payrolls from the time rolls of their
\par foreman. Derby expressed surprise that "so
\par large a measure of success can be achieved by
\par such unsystematic efforts." Yet by the end of
\par the 19th century, hope was growing that
\par ruinous floods might become a thing of the
\par past. "For the first time in the history of the
\par river," reported the Mississippi River
\par Commission in 1897, "a great flood passed
\par between banks from Red River to the Gulf. The
\par whole sugar country, where inundation means
\par destruction, was saved from overflow."17
\par I t is against the background of these
\par achievements in technique and organization
\par that the most controversial aspect of Federal
\par policy-its commitment to flood control by
\par levees only-must be viewed. "Levees only" did
\par not mean that the only activity of the
\par Mississippi River Commission was building
\par levees. It did mean, however, that by the early
\par 1890's levees had come to be accepted-by the
\par majority of the Commission, by the levee
\par boards, by Congress, and apparently by the
\par people of the Valley-as a complete answer to
\par floods, as the only major control work that
\par should be attempted, and as the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 raison d' etre }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 of
\par the Commission itself. The reasons for this
\par policy shift were complex.
\par A common explanation of "levees only" held
\par that it was advocated by Humphreys and
\par Abbot, and that their influence combined with
\par the forces of organizational inertia to secure
\par the policy's adoption and preclude change.ls
\par However, the conventional explanation left
\par much unexplained. For one thing, the
\par Commission did not hesitate to oppose
\par Humphreys and Abbot whenever it wished to
\par do so, holding, for example, that crevasses
\par caused shoaling of the main channel, a point
\par which the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 Physics and Hydraulics }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 specifically
\par denied.19 Again, the Commission maintained
\par during the 1880's that the Mississippi, if its
\par banks were stabilized, would scour a deeper
\par channel for itself, while Humphreys and Abbot
\par had declared that the bed of the Mississippi
\par was a tenacious clay, as difficult to scour as
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 marble.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par The real source of the "levees-only" policy
\par was to be found not in Humphreys and Abbot,
\par but in the political and economic facts of the
\par situation faced by the Mississippi River
\par Commission. Fundamental was the pressure of
\par Valley residents for immediate and local
\par rather than long-range and comprehensive
\par protection against floods. By the mid-1880's
\par Congress and the War Department had
\par become disenchanted with the works of
\par channel improvement. Senators from the
\par riparian states urged the Commission to
\par exercise its powers upon levees and let other
\par works take second place. Congress
\par disapproved spending for contraction works in
\par 1886, and the Commission applied the money to
\par levees. On 30 June 1887 Senator Randall L.
\par Gibson of Louisiana "congratulated the
\par Commission upon the fact that their
\par recommendations had not been approved by
\par the Secretary of War. :The sentiment ofthetwo
\par Houses was opposed to revetment. The
\par contraction of the river by levees is the proper
\par method of procedure."21 The flood of 1890
\par brought in renewed applications from local
\par groups for assistance in completing their levee
\par lines. Local officials, pleading that the burden
\par of debt was too great to bear, often made no
\par effort to justify their requests by the
\par navigation plea.22 Congress, in the River and
\par Harbor Act of 19 September, for the first time
\par omitted the proviso against building levees for
\par flood contro1.23 Though the prohibition later
\par reappeared in one}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352  act, the effects of this flood}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par on levee policy were decisive.24 In its
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 Proceedings }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 the Commission recorded the
\par claim of the railroads to levees as protection for
\par their lines; the emphatic support of Congress;
\par and the backing of levees by eastern capital, as
\par the vice-president of the New York Chamber of
\par Commerce led a delegation before the
\par Commission to urge that "one half the whole
\par appropriation" be spent in preventing
\par inundations in the lower valley. One member of
\par the Chamber "explained his conference with
\par the President of the United States, on the
\par alluvial valley problem. He thought himself
\par that every dollar practicable should be applied
\par to levees."25 As important as the political facts
\par was a physical fact-a decade of effort had
\par shown that the river would not scour its bed
\par except locally and temporarily. Furthermore,
\par Humphreys and Abbot had been proved right
\par on one important issue, and Eads wrong: levees
\par raised flood heights, requiring a constantly
\par rising levee line to contain them.
\par Faced with these dilemmas, the Commission
\par in 1891-1892 turned to dredging as a means of
\par giving water transport its all-year channel,26
\par At the same time, the MRC, faced with
\par revetment costs which had soared to $30 a
\par linear foot, began to limit bank protection to
\par endangered areas and shift money from
\par channel works to levees threatened by rising
\par floods. 27 By 1896 the Commission was ready to
\par declare in effect that its original policy had
\par proved economically unjustifiable and that
\par "the practical results contemplated by the Act
\par organizing the Commission ... can be attained
\par with greater economy and probability of
\par success, and in less time by the dredging of
\par obstructing bars in low water and the
\par maintenance, in cooperation with the State and
\par local authorities, of an effective levee system."
\par Revetment was to be placed in selected reaches
\par to prevent cutoffs and to protect harbors and
\par threatened levees of "exceptional importance."
\par When, on 3 June 1896, Congress enacted a new
\par Rivers and Harbors Act over President Grover}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 Cleveland's veto, the opening of a 9-foot
\par channel by dredging "from Cairo down"
\par became national policy. Earlier hopes for a
\par narrowed, self-scouring river were
\par abandoned. A minority in the Commission, led
\par by Lieutenant Colonel Amos Stickney, fought
\par to have the allotment for bank revetment and
\par channel work increased, but was defeated by a
\par 4-4 vote.28 Channel improvement works other
\par than dredging and revetment were now
\par abandoned.
\par Thus, "levees only" reflected a mixture of
\par physical fact and the political wishes of those
\par who had the ultimate power-of Congress, the
\par War Department, powerful private interest
\par groups, and the people of the Alluvial Valley.
\par As the Valley developed economically, flood
\par control came to enjoy powerful backing
\par throughout the eastern United States as well as
\par in its old alluvial and western centers of power.
\par Levees were simply the best established and
\par most politically remunerative form of flood
\par control. They were works that meant
\par immediate protection for homes, businesses,
\par and railroads. Under limited appropriations,
\par any diversion of funds meant loss of protection
\par for someone; at the same time, other modes
\par were experimental, lacked public and
\par Congressional support, and were condemned
\par by the leading authorities. "Levees only"
\par became public policy because Congress
\par wanted it, and, in fact, because almost
\par everybody of influence in the Mississippi
\par Valley wanted it.
\par Until 1926 the development of the Federal
\par program was a matter of extension, definition,
\par and elaboration of existing policy rather than
\par the introduction of new ideas. Levees were to
\par hold out floods; dredging was to open an allyear
\par channel; the District Engineers at St.
\par Louis and Vicksburg carried on a program of
\par snagging; the Corps was engaged in building a
\par system of reservoirs at the headwaters of the
\par Mississippi.29 Add to these the programs of
\par surveys and mapping, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 and the result was what}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par might have been called the classical form of
\par Federal river policy. Compared with anything
\par that had been done in the past, this program
\par was profoundly impressive. Under it the levee
\par system reached a condition of completeness
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 never before known.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par Yet the levees that protected the land against
\par ordinary high water continually raised the
\par crests of the great floods. As agriculture and
\par industry prospered behind the walls of earth,
\par the possible losses from flood increased as well.
\par The number of human lives that a great flood
\par would endanger rose with the water. Political
\par and economic facts had led the Commission to
\par adopt levees as a cureall for floods in the
\par Valley. Since in fact they were not a cureall,
\par total dependence on them represented a grave,
\par though mostly hidden, danger.
\par The gradual buildup of floodwaters within
\par the leveed channel was noted both inside and
\par outside the Commission. Threats were
\par occasionally made by riparian landholders to
\par sue the Commission on account of flood heights
\par raised by its work. Following the record spring
\par flood of 1903, a bulletin of the United States
\par Weather Bureau estimated that the levees
\par erected since 1882 had raised the floodwaters
\par at Memphis "between 7 and 8 feet, the latter
\par figure probably being more nearly correct."31
\par After 1903, an increasing number of
\par independent experts on the river began to
\par demand some revision of the "levees only"
\par policy, and citizens' groups were formed to
\par push for change.32 Yet the strongest floodcontrol
\par associations, the levee districts, and the
\par Commission kept to their established course.33
\par By 1926 the Commission felt that the flood
\par problem had }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \fs24\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af40\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 \hich\af0\dbch\af40\loch\f0 b~en }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 nearly solved by the levees,

\par and that maintenance and bank protection
\par would be the concerns of the future. 34
\par In the autumn of that year, however, signs
\par began to appear indicating that the levees were
\par to be subjected to another test. In October,
\par Major John C. H. Lee, the newly appointed
\par District Engineer at Vicksburg, noted that the
\par river had risen to 40 feet on the Vicksburg
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 gage.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 He began to study the history of the
\par gage, and found that it had reached 30 feet in
\par October only six times in 54 years, and each
\par time the spring following had brought
\par extremely high water. He began a series of
\par staff meetings to mobilize the resources of his
\par district against the expected emergency.
\par The new year opened ominously, with a
\par minor flood in January, and a somewhat
\par higher one in February. In early March the
\par waters fell somewhat, but toward the end of the
\par month the seasonal rises of the Ohio, Missouri,
\par and Tennessee showed not only a magnitude
\par but also a degree of synchronization that
\par plainly warned of a major flood on the way.36
\par The first three weeks were taken up with a
\par slow rise culminating in disaster. From St.
\par Louis to New Orleans the levees swarmed with
\par men, struggling against the water in the north,
\par and, in the south, building up emergency
\par supplies against what the New York }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 Times
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 warned might be "the greatest and most
\par damaging flood in the history of the valley."37
\par The worst sign of all was the weather. Spring
\par rains, especially in the middle Valley, were
\par exceptionally heavy,38 and on the night of 15
\par April New Orleans had a deluge of almost
\par Biblical dimensions-14.01 inches.39 On 18
\par April the river stood at 56.2 feet at Cairo, and
\par the lowlands were flooding rapidly; there were
\par 25,000 homeless, and at least 12 dead. The
\par worst sufferers were Missouri, Arkansas, and
\par Mississippi, . with lesser areas inundated in
\par Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana.
\par Near New Orleans armed guards patrolled
\par the levees. The rule in great floods had always
\par been }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 sauve qui peut, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 every man for himself:
\par everybody feared that his own levee might be
\par dynamited by his neighbors to ease the
\par pressure of the water. At Poydras, below New
\par Orleans, four men approached the levee in a
\par skiff one night. When they failed to answer a
\par guard's challenge he fired. One man was
\par killed. "Residents," noted the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 Times }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 laconically}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par "had been warned not to approach the levees
\par after dark."
\par Cloudbursts fell in southern Kansas, raising
\par the Arkansas, which broke through the levees
\par in Pulaski County and flooded 15,000 acres of
\par Arkansas' richest land. The Red Cross
\par appealed for funds. Refugees poured into
\par Cairo, St. Louis, and a hundred lesser spots.
\par New York investment bankers, "fearing
\par property which forms the basis of bond issues,
\par might have been damaged by the waters,"
\par rushed inquiries to St. Louis. They were
\par reassured to learn that the business district of
\par the city was safe, and that the riverfront was
\par "covered with small buildings" only. The
\par reports did not say who, if anybody, lived
\par there.
\par Following the cloudburst of the 15th, New
\par Orleans enjoyed several days of sunshine. The
\par New Orleans Engineer District and the
\par Fourth District labored to strengthen and
\par raise levees in the area. But the river was
\par rising at every gage from New Orleans to St.
\par Paul, and every major tributary except the
\par Cumberland and the Tennessee was also
\par rising. On 20 April the gage at Carroll ton stood
\par at 20.2, up 0.1 foot from the day before.42 The
\par reports from upriver were an excruciating
\par mixture of good and bad news. Whenever the
\par Mississippi broke its levees the danger to New
\par Orleans from the gigantic flood crest moving
\par downriver was lessened to some degree. And as
\par the crisis of 21-30 April began, there was little
\par to be heard but of this sort of tragic blessing.
\par Non-Federal levees upstream were being
\par overwhelmed, and for the first time in history a
\par mainline levee of full Commission grade failed
\par at Mound Landing, Mississippi, flooding an
\par area 50 miles wide and 75 miles long.43
\par On the 20th the river reached 44.7 feet at
\par Memphis and the levee broke at Clarendon,
\par Arkansas. Miss Rosa Gibson, the town's
\par telephone operator, watched from an upper
\par window of her office building as houses,
\par animals, and river craft were washed down}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid7221497\charrsid8089352 Clarendon's main street.44 Recalling the night
\par of 20-21 April, Major Lee wrote, "No steamer
\par was able to stem the current .... So, we rushed
\par in sacks (for sand bags) by airplane, by small
\par boats braving the swirling current of the
\par Arkansas south of Pine Bluff. Labor consisted
\par of white volunteers, of drafted Negroes, of
\par National Guardsmen, and of convicts from the
\par state farm. All worked side by side just as they
\par would fight in a trench. They held this levee ten
\par days and nights through wretched weather,
\par cold and wet, until another attack developed
\par just below and the forces had to be divided. It
\par was then that the crisis came and South Bend
\par went out. Defeat after a fight like that is

\par Some refugee camps were flooding, and
\par epidemics of mumps, measles, and whooping
\par cough broke out among survivors. At Little
\par Rock, a train loaded with coal was parked on a
\par steel bridge across the Arkansas to give it
\par added stability. The bridge began to vibrate so
\par intensely that the coal caught fire from the
\par friction. Shortly afterward, bridge, train, and
\par burning coal toppled into the water.46 At New
\par Orleans, Corps employees and volunteers
\par worked all night, by electric lights or lanterns,
\par with the rain and chill of an unseasonal cold
\par front blowing on them. Though levees about
\par the city itself were stronger than ever before,
\par and despite the relief given by crevasses
\par upstream, Engineers at New Orleans were
\par already considering desperate measures. The
\par Corps of Engineers reported to President
\par Calvin Coolidge that the flood would be the
\par worst in a generation, and George C.
\par Schoenberger, chief engineer of the State of
\par Louisiana, said publicly that a mainline levee
\par break somewhere in the state had become

\par The finale went with a bang-and a fizzle.
\par Trappers and farmers from the area to be
\par flooded were reported guarding the levee with
\par "machine guns, riot guns, rifles and pistols,"
\par but were expected to submit when the time
\par came. Riotous public meetings were held, and
\par state authorities made the expected promises
\par of compensation. Meantime, in New Orleans,
\par 500 "pump guns" were issued to patrol squads
\par to guard against possible reprisals. An
\par embargo was placed on dynamite sales, and
\par 400 National Guardsmen camped about the
\par city.
\par On 29 April six successive charges of
\par dynamite breached the Poydras levee. Though
\par 1,500 pounds had exploded, a reporter wrote
\par angrily that the "awe-inspiring spectacle that
\par had been promised was lacking. There was no
\par gigantic torrent.... There was the muffled
\par sound of exploding dynamite, earth and stones
\par shot into the air, and there was silence. The
\par water seeped slowly, almost reluctantly,
\par through the comparatively small holes and

\par slowly grew to the needed dimensions.
\par Yet the levee was the least that the

\par both to initiate and to veto flood control
\par projects on the Mississippi would be lodged in
\par the Office of the Chief of Engineers.!l Finally,
\par Jadwin recommended the creation of a

\par small-scale models of the river. Old themes of
\par the river's history-the scientific inquiry that
\par had begun with the Delta Survey, the
\par expansion of Federal power, the concentration
\par of that power in the hands of the Chief of
\par Engineers-were carried a long step further
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf22\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 when }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf21\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 the Jadwin Plan became law}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par a comprehensive answer as the Jadwin Plan if

\par the American people and transforming their
\par concepts of government, as the Civil War had
\par changed them in the past. From the turn of the
\par century to the First World War, the American
\par political scene was dominated by recurrent
\par demands for reform in almost every aspect of
\par national life. The Progressive Era was
\par dramatized by Theodore Roosevelt and
\par resulted in the enactment of far-reaching
\par reforms under Woodrow Wilson. Under the
\par Progressive impulse, new demands were
\par heard for conservation and development of
\par resources, and these were combined with flood
\par control to produce the first programs of
\par comprehensive waterways development. At
\par first the Corps was hostile to multiple use
\par planning, but in 1925 shifted its stance and
\par began to study the comprehensive
\par develop}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid8089352 ment of American river basins,!}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 
\par Congress passed landmark laws in three
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 successive decades.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 In 1917 the first flood
\par control act committed the nation to prevent
\par overflows on the Mississippi and Sacramento
\par Rivers. Though this law in no way represented
\par the real entry of the Federal Government into
\par the field, it was important for two reasons.
\par First, it swept away any lingering pretense
\par that levee building was intended only to benefit
\par navigation, and proclaimed openly that flood
\par control was a proper activity of the national
\par government. It did not begin the era of Federal
\par flood control, but it did end t}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 he era of Federal}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 
\par subterfuge. Second, the law established
\par standards for Federal-state division of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf25\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 costs,
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 providing that one-third the cost of flood
\par control works should be paid by the Federal
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf25\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 Government }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 and two-thirds by local interests.
\par Shortly afterward, for defense purposes, the
\par Federal Government began a program to
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf25\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 encourage }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 the rebirth of trade and commerce
\par on the Mississippi. Waterways played an
\par important role in the nation's }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf25\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 war }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf24\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 effort and a
\par major rebirth of waterborne commerce took
\par place. 19 In both navigation and flood control the
\par Woodrow Wilson administration was a time of
\par progress, reborn effort, and new ideas.
\par Indicating the bipartisan nature of the new
\par approach, the next decisive changes took place
\par under that stern Vermont conservative, Calvin
\par Coolidge. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 3
\par March 1925 opened the way to comprehensive
\par planning for waterways development.2o Flood
\par control, navigation, power production, and
\par irrigation were declared to be interdependent
\par aspects of waterways development, which
\par must be considered together in planning for
\par the use of the nation's rivers and lakes. Under
\par Coolidge, too, the integrated response of seven
\par Federal agencies to the crisis of 1927
\par foreshadowed future methods of disaster
\par relief. The President apparently intervened at
\par several points in the evolution of the Jadwin
\par Plan, and ultimately proclaimed it as the guide
\par to the nation's new flood control program.
\par Many of the concepts of the Jadwin Plan were
\par adopted in the Flood Control Act of 1928,
\par passage of which was accelerated by the losses
\par of lives and property generated by the 1927
\par flood. Basically, the 1928 Act set up the allimportant
\par "Mississippi River & Tributaries
\par Flood Control Plan." The plan was then carried
\par into effect under those bitter political and
\par ideological rivals, Herbert Hoover and
\par Franklin D. Roosevelt. By the 1930's,
\par practically anything about Federal flood

\par much the same story. In 50 years, the timber
\par and piling buried in moist earth were sound,
\par while at a higher level, timber surrounded by

\par While these tests were carried out in the field,
\par soil permeability was being tested at the

\par pilings, field examinations, and laboratory
\par work gave an extraordinarily comprehensive
\par picture of the region, and of the most
\par promising form for the engineering structures
\par to be erected there.
\par As finally projected, the weir was a concrete
\par structure resting upon timber piles 65 to 70
\par feet long. On the river side, a line of
\par interlocking sheet steel piling prevented
\par lateral flow of the soil caused by the weight of
\par the weir and also prevented percolation of
\par water through the porous subsoil. Baulks of
\par wood ("needles") formed the weir gates; in time
\par of need these could be removed one by one to
\par take off the crest of the flood. Behind the
\par spillway weir was a stilling basin, consisting of
\par a concrete apron with baffles to break the
\par inflow of water which might otherwise
\par endanger the weir and flood way behind it.
\par Riprap covered by articulated concrete slabs
\par completed the structure by preventing
\par undermining from the rear.
\par Work was begun at once and by 10 February
\par 1931 the spillway weir stood complete.36 The

\par sides of the spillway brought to final grade,
\par except for gaps at the highway and railroad
\par crossings. Work now began on the bridges that
\par were to carry the rail and highway traffic
\par across the spillway, and by the midsummer of
\par 1936 the crossings had been completed and the
\par gaps in the guide levees closed. The end of the
\par year saw the completion of work on the
\par Mississippi levee that fronted the weir, to

\par Very heavy winter rainfall in the Ohio River
\par Valley produced the truly gigantic flow of 1.85
\par million second-feet at Cairo. Fortunately, this
\par immense crest moved alone; an earlier flood on
\par the White had already passed, and the upper
\par Mississippi reserved its waters until May.
\par Still, the Ohio flood was met at Cairo by a flow
\par of 164,000 second-feet from the upper river,
\par which meant that over 2 million second-feet
\par were moving down the Valley in J anuary.
\par Gage readings frequently exceeded those of
\par 1927. To save Cairo, the Birds Point-New
\par Madrid Floodway was opened by dynamiting
\par the fuse-plug after it failed to crevasse.39 Cairo
\par was saved, and though levees had to be
\par sandbagged and backwater areas were badly
\par flooded, the mainline levees held. Local
\par misfortunes and suffering occurred, requiring
\par the Red Cross and the National Guard to be
\par called out, and the Public Works
\par Administration and the Civilian Conservation
\par Corps provided labor forces for sentry and
\par maintenance work along the levees. But there
\par was no comparison with the ruin of 1927. Men
\par might begin to hope-cautiously-that a single
\par decade had solved the flood problem of
\par centuries. One test remained, however, in the
\par Delta, where all the upstream waters must be
\par funneled safely past New Orleans and
\par discharged into the Gulf of Mexico. The fresh
\par sod on the levee at Bonnet Carre would have no
\par chance to root itself after all.
\par The Natchez gage recorded the highest in
\par history. As they had upstream, local and

\par which had not yet been raised to the 1928
\par grade. There were gaps in the Atchafalaya
\par levees that had to}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf35\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352  be hurriedly filled, and plank}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf35\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352

\par The Atchafalaya Basin was a part of the

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf37\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 of all distributaries of the Mississippi, the
\par Atchafalaya, was in Fisk's words:
\par A complex stream which flows partly
\par in its own channel, partly in a channel
\par inherited from other streams; which
\par possesses a single channel for only part
\par of its length; which builds a delta into a
\par lake system along its course; and which
\par finally flows from the lake system into
\par an arm of the sea through several
\par channels.43
\par The Atchafalaya was so complex largely
\par because it was a new stream still in process of
\par creation, and one which had been shaped to an
\par extraordinary degree by the human activities
\par which surrounded it for a great part of its
\par existence.
\par Created during the fifteenth century A.D.,
\par the Atchafalaya took form when an enlarging
\par loop of the Mississippi, later called Turnbull's
\par Bend, broke into the basin of the Red River.
\par Water from the great river was forced down a
\par small distributary of the Red which flowed
\par south into a marshy valley bet}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf37\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 ween the Teche}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf37\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 
\par and Lafourche ridges. In the valley was a large
\par lake formed by the drainage from the ridges, a
\par lake which had already found an outlet to the
\par sea through the channel later named the
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf37\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 "lower Atchafalaya."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf37\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352  When the first
\par Europeans arrived, they found the
\par A tchafalaya a well-defined distributary
\par flowing out of Turnbull's Bend a few miles
\par south of its confluence with the Red. The
\par distributary was so placed, however, that it
\par became a trap for drift timber brought down
\par by the two rivers that fed it. By 1778 a great
\par raft had formed near the head of the stream,
\par effectively blocking its further enlargement.45
\par At this point human beings began to tinker
\par with the Atchafalaya. As settlement
\par proceeded, the obstruction of the raft became
\par increasingly burdensome to farmers, and
\par during the drought of 1839 settlers set fire to it
\par and burned it to the waterline. The next year
\par the State of Louisiana began clearing out the
\par underwater logs with snag boats. Though the
\par raft periodically re-formed, it was just as

\par problems of drinking water and waste disposal
\par in a tidal estuary were sobering. The elaborate

\par course of two centuries on the lower
\par Mississippi, would become useless. The
\par Atchafalaya Basin would face the danger of
\par disastrous floods. And the Old River channel
\par could not merely be blocked off, for the
\par Atchafalaya was still essential to control the
\par project flood. All in all, the diversion threat
\par represented a problem of extraordinary

\par Corps studies resulted in a Federal law of 3
\par September 1954, which provided for control
\par structures at Old River, in effect transforming
\par the Atchafalaya into a gigantic controlled
\par floodway/spillway system. Congress
\par authorized an overbank structure resembling
\par the spillway weir at Bonnet Carre to control
\par the passage of floodwater into the Atchafalaya,
\par and a low sill structure in a dredged channel
\par paralleling Old River to regulate flow during
\par periods of low water. A navigation lock was
\par provided to make the Red-Atchafalaya
\par accessible to river traffic from the Mississippi,
\par and when this work was completed the mouth
\par of Old River was sealed off. Meantime, a
\par control structure at Morganza' had been
\par finished in June 1956, completing the work on
\par the eastern channel of the floodway. By these
\par works the Atchafalaya-most complex of all
\par the flood way projects-was prevented from}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf40\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352

\par efficient and dependable temporary channel
\par for the great river in time of flood. 
\par As might be expected, the existence of so vast
\par a structure as the Atchafalaya Floodway
\par caused problems. Like any other alluvial
\par stream the Atchafalaya continued to build
\par land and change its own course. The
\par inefficiency of its lower channel caused
\par constantly rising stages upstream, and soil
\par instability made maintenance of levee grades
\par exceptionally difficult. But the development of
\par a stable channel was only one of the continuing
\par problems of the region. Levees blocked
\par streams and obstructed natural drainage. In
\par consequence, the Engineers diverted fresh
\par water through drainage structures at Bayous
\par Courtableau and Darbonne.58 South of the
\par distribution structures, drainage from the
\par region west of the flood way which formerly
\par entered the Atchafalaya flowed by a
\par continuous chain of borrow pits to Charenton
\par drainage and navigation canal, or by Bayou
\par Teche through Wax Lake Outlet into the Gulf.
\par Similarly, on the east of the floodway, drainage
\par moved by Grand or Bell River to Lake
\par Palourde or Verret and thence to the Gulf
\par Intracoastal Waterway and the Gulf. Thus, the
\par whole drainage pattern of the region was
\par rearranged.
\par Finally, the basin-especially the West
\par Atchafalaya Floodway-attracted fishermen,
\par hunters, and farmers, causing the District to
\par draw up a master recreation plan for the
\par region. Despite the flood way easement written
\par into all deeds for which the Federal
\par Government paid out considerable money,
\par whole communities of farms and camps sprang
\par up, some representing heavy investments.
\par People who invested would, of course, exercise
\par maximum pressure to prevent the floodway
\par from being used for the purpose for which it
\par was intended. 59 The complexity of maintaining
\par and using the floodway was almost as great as
\par the difficulty encountered in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf38\insrsid8089352\charrsid8089352 building it; yet}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf38\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 
\par when tested the system proved to be worth its
\par cost.
\par The test came in 1973. Serious flood
\par emergencies in 1945 and 1950 brought new
\par openings of Bonnet Carre, but not of the
\par Atchafalaya system, though dynamite was
\par ready in 1945 and the decision not to breach the
\par fuse plugs was "a matter of tenths of a foot."6o
\par Almost a quarter of a century elapsed without
\par further need to use either spillway or floodway.
\par Then, in April 1973, floods again swept the
\par Mississippi Basin, killing 16 people.61 As
\par hundreds fled their homes in the Alluvial
\par Valley, the New Orleans District girded for a
\par dangerous crest worsened by heavy rains. The

\par partially evacuated and bulldozers began to

\par the flooded region with Senator John C.
\par Stennis of Mississippi. On 27 April, Nixon
\par added Arkansas and Louisiana to the list of
\par disaster area states.72 But by mid-month, the
\par river, though still above flood stage, was falling
\par slowly, leaving $420 million in damage and 27
\par dead from Illinois to Louisiana.
\par Slowly the state dug out. The Engineers
\par dredged to reopen navigation channels at
\par Morgan City and began to raise 260 miles of
\par mainline levee as a precaution against further
\par flooding.73 Yet even as valley residents met to
\par demand expanded flood protection,74 Corps
\par spokesmen could point to the immense job
\par accomplished by the existing system. One of
\par the great floods of history had passed,
\par overwhelming local levees and devastating
\par backwater areas. Yet the mainline levees had
\par held and the diversion channels had worked.
\par "The real story of the great flood," said a
\par national magazine, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf43\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 "is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf42\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 not the damage done but
\par the massive destruction that was prevented."75
\par An Engineer estimated damages averted
\par below Cairo at $6 billion, those above at $1.5
\par billion.76 Nevertheless, the flood gave a
\par formidable warning to the nation. Senator
\par Stennis demanded higher priorities for flood
\par control work,77 and the inherent danger posed
\par by uncontrolled urban occupancy of flood
\par plains was made painfully clear. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf43\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 "If }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\cf42\insrsid15039558\charrsid8089352 we had
\par had proper flood-plain regulations 10 years
\par ago," declared a Corps spokesman at
\par Vicksburg, "over one-third of the $128 million

\par To the New Orleans District, aftermath of
\par the flood included extensive dredging, repair,
\par and disaster relief activities. Scour holes
\par beneath the low sill structure had to be filled,
\par the wingwall replaced by a rock dike, flowlines
\par revised in the Atchafalaya Floodway and
\par levees raised. Various pumping stations were
\par enlarged; the Charenton Floodgate in the West
\par Atchafalaya Protection Levee was modified.

\par floods in 1937, 1945, 1950, and 1973 were
