\par Whoever is faithful in small matters will be faithful in large ones; whoever is dishonest in small matters will be dishonest in large ones.
\par Do to others as you would have them do to you.
\par But you say, \'93Why does he not?\'93 Because the Lord was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
\par Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
\par So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.
\par Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
\par For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\par Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
\par Nehemiah said, \'93Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.\'94

\par Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.
\par Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city.

\par Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
\par Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.
\par There are three things that amaze me\emdash no, four things that I don't understand: how an eagle glides through the sky, how a snake slithers on a rock, how a ship navigates the ocean, how a man loves a woman.

\par PREFACE.
\par THE Author has to express his great obligations to many
\par gentlemen who have assisted him in the preparation of this
\par volume, either by affording access to their libraries, or by
\par furnishing or revising translations from the Chinese, &c. ;
\par and he must especially tender them to J. Haas, Esq., the
\par Austro-Hungarian Vice-Consul at Shanghai, to Mr. Thomas
\par Kingsmill and the Rev. W. Holt of Shanghai, to Mr.
\par Falconer of Hong-Kong, and to Dr. N. B. Dennys of
\par Singapore.
\par For the sake of uniformity, the author has endeavoured
\par to reduce all the romanised representations of Chinese sounds
\par to the system adopted by S. W. Williams, whose invaluable
\par dictionary is the most available one for students. No alteration,
\par however, has been made when quotations from
\par eminent sinologues like Legge have been inserted.
\par Should the present volume prove sufficiently interesting to
\par attract readers, a second one will be issued at a future date,
\par in continuation of the subject.
\par June, 1884.
\par NOTE BY THE PUBLISHEES.
\par THE Publishers think it right to state that, owing to the Author's
\par absence in China, the work has not had the advantage of his supervision
\par in its passage through the press. It is also proper to mention that the

\par INTRODUCTION.
\par IT would have been a bold step indeed for anyone, some
\par thirty years ago, to have thought of treating the public to a
\par collection of stones ordinarily reputed fabulous, and of claiming
\par for them the consideration due to genuine realities, or
\par to have advocated tales, time-honoured as fictions, as actual
\par facts ; and those of the nursery as being, in many instances,
\par legends, more or less distorted, descriptive of real beings or
\par events.
\par Now-a-days it is a less hazardous proceeding. The great
\par era of advanced opinion, initiated by Darwin, which has seen,
\par in the course of a few years, a larger progress in knowledge
\par in all departments of science than decades of centuries preceding
\par it, has, among other changes, worked a complete
\par revolution in the estimation of the value of folk-lore ; and
\par speculations on it, which in the days of our boyhood would
\par have been considered as puerile, are now admitted to be not
\par merely interesting but necessary to those who endeavour to
\par gather up the skeins of unwritten history, and to trace the
\par antecedents and early migrations from parent sources of
\par nations long since alienated from each other by customs,
\par speech, and space.
\par i
\par MONSTERS.
\par I have, therefore, but little hesitation in gravely proposing
\par to submit that many of the so-called mythical animals, which
\par throughout long ages and in all nations have been the fertile
\par subjects of fiction and fable, come legitimately within the
\par scope of plain matter-of-fact Natural History, and that they
\par may be considered, not as the outcome of exuberant fancy,
\par but as creatures which really once existed, and of which,
\par unfortunately, only imperfect and inaccurate descriptions have
\par filtered down to us, probably very much refracted, through
\par the mists of time.
\par I propose to follow, for a certain distance only, the path
\par which has been pursued in the treatment of myths by
\par mythologists, so far only, in fact, as may be necessary to
\par trace out the homes and origin of those stories which in
\par their later dress are incredible ; deviating from it to dwell
\par upon the possibility of their having preserved to us, through
\par the medium of unwritten Natural History, traditions of creatures
\par once co-existing with man, some of which are so weird
\par and terrible as to appear at first sight to be impossible. I
\par propose stripping them of those supernatural characters with
\par which a mysteriously implanted love of the wonderful has
\par invested them, and to examine them, as at the present day
\par we are fortunately able to do, by the lights of the modern
\par sciences of Geology, Evolution, and Philology.
\par For me the major part of these creatures are not chimeras
\par but objects of rational study. The dragon, in place of being
\par a creature evolved out of the imagination of Aryan man by
\par the contemplation of lightning flashing through the caverns
\par which he tenanted, as is held by some mythologists, is an
\par animal which once lived and dragged its ponderous coils, and
\par perhaps flew ; which devastated herds, and on occasions swallowed
\par their shepherd; which, establishing its lair in some
\par cavern overlooking the fertile plain, spread terror and
\par destruction around, and, protected from assault by dread or
\par superstitious feeling, may even have been subsidised by the
\par INTRODUCTION.
\par terror-stricken peasantry, who, failing the power to destroy
\par it, may have preferred tethering offerings of cattle adjacent
\par to its cavern to having it come down to seek supplies from
\par amongst their midst.*
\par To me the specific existence of the unicorn seems not incredible,
\par and, in fact, more probable than that theory which
\par assigns its origin to a lunar myth.f
\par Again, believing as I do in the existence of some great
\par undescribed inhabitant of the ocean depths, the much-derided
\par sea-serpent, whose home seems especially to be adjacent to
\par Norway, I recognise this monster as originating the myths
\par of the midgard serpent which the Norse Elder Eddas have
\par collected, this being the contrary view to that taken by
\par mythologists, who invert the derivation, and suppose the
\par stories current among the Norwegian fishermen to be modified
\par versions of this important element of Norse mythology.J
\par * This tributary offering is a common feature in dragon legends. A
\par good example is that given by El Edrisi in his history of the dragon
\par destroyed by Alexander the Great in the island of Mostachin (one of
\par the Canaries?).
\par t The latest writer on this point summarizes his views, in his opening
\par remarks, as follows :
\par " The science of heraldry has faithfully preserved
\par to modern times various phases of some of those remarkable legends
\par which, based upon a study of natural phenomena, exhibit the process
\par whereby the greater part of mythology has come into existence. Thus
\par we find the solar gryphon, the solar phcenix, a demi-eagle displayed
\par issuing from flames of fire ; the solar lion and the lunar unicorn, which
\par two latter noble creatures now harmoniously support the royal arms. I
\par propose in the following pages to examine the myth of the unicorn,
\par the wild, white, fierce, chaste, moon, whose two horns, unlike those of
\par mortal creatures, are indissolubly twisted into one ; the creature that
\par endlessly fights with the lion to gain the crown or summit of heaven,
\par which neither may retain, and whose brilliant horn drives away the darkness
\par and evil of the night even as we find in the myth, that Yenym is
\par defended by the horn of the unicorn." The Unicorn; a Mythological
\par Investigation. Eobert Brown, jun., F.S.A. London, 1881.

\par I must admit that, for my part, I doubt the general derivation
\par of myths from " the contemplation of the visible
\par workings of external nature."* It seems to me easier to

\par * The Voyages and Adventures of Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, done into
\par English by H. C. G-ent, London, 1653, p. 109. The vindication of
\par Pinto' s reputation for veracity will doubtless one day be, to a great
\par extent, effected, for although his interesting narrative is undoubtedly
\par embroidered with a rich tissue of falsity, due apparently to an exaggerated
\par credulity upon his part, and systematic deception upon that of his
\par Chinese informants, he certainly is undeserving of the wholesale condemnation
\par of which Congreve was the reflex when he made Foresight,
\par addressing Sir Sampson Legend, say: "Thou modern Mandeville,
\par Ferdinand Mendez Pinto was but a type of thee, thou liar of the first
\par magnitude." Love for Love, Act. 2, Scene 1. There are many points
\par in his narrative which are corroborated by history and the accounts of
\par other voyages ; and it must be remembered that, although the major
\par part of the names of places and persons which he gives are now unrecognisable,
\par yet this may be due to alterations 'from the lapse of time,
\par and from the difficulty of recognising the true original Chinese or
\par Japanese word under those produced by the foreign mode of transliteration
\par in vogue in those days. Thus the Port Liampoo of Pinto is now
\par and has been for many years past only known as Ningpo, the first name
\par being a term of convenience, used by the early Portuguese voyagers,
\par and long since abandoned. Just as the wonderful Quinsay of Marco
\par Polo (still known by that name in Pinto's time) has been only successfully
\par identified (with Hangchow-fu) through the antiquarian research
\par of Colonel Yule. So also the titles of Chaems, Tutons, Chumbins,
\par Aytons, Anchacy's, which Pinto refers to (p. 108), are only with difficulty
\par recognisable in those respectively of Tsi'ang (a Manchu governor),

\par the apparently obviously untruthful statement which he makes of the

\par beasts of burthen and articles of food (p. 158) is explicable, I think, on

\par INTRODUCTION.
\par Now as some of the creatures whose existence I shall have
\par to contend for in these volumes are objects of derision to a
\par large proportion of mankind, and of reasonable doubt to
\par another, I cannot help fortifying myself with some such outwork
\par of reasoning as the pith of Pinto's remarks affords,
\par and supplementing it by adding that, while the balance
\par between scepticism and credulity is undoubtedly always difficult
\par to hold, yet, as Lord Bacon well remarks,
\par " There is
\par nothing makes a man suspect much more than to know little ;
\par and therefore men should remedy suspicion by procuring to
\par know more."
\par Whately extends Bacon's proposition by adding,
\par " This is
\par equally true of the suspicions that have reference to things
\par as persons
\par "
\par ; in other words, ignorance and suspicion go
\par hand-in-hand, and so travellers' tales, even when supported
\par by good evidence, are mostly denied credence or accepted
\par with repugnance, when they offend the experience of those
\par who, remaining at home, are thus only partially educated.
\par Hence it is, not to go too far back for examples, that we
\par have seen Bruce, Mungo Park, Du Chaillu, Gordon Gumming,
\par Schliemann,* and Stanley treated with the most ungenerous
\par criticism and contemptuous disbelief by persons
\par who, however well informed in many subjects, lacked the
\par extended and appreciative views which can only be acquired
\par by travel.
\par Nor is this incredulity limited to travellers' tales about
\par savage life. It is just as often displayed in reference to the
\par that a large transport corps of them could easily be amassed by a

\par * "
\par By the kindness of my friend, Mr. Bartlett, I have been enabled
\par to examine a most beautiful Japanese carving in ivory, said to be one
\par hundred and fifty years old, and called by the Japanese net suke or togle.
\par These togles are handed down from one generation to the next, and
\par they record any remarkable event that happens to any member of a
\par family. This carving is an inch and a half long, and about as big
\par as a walnut. It represents a lady in a quasi-leaning attitude, and
\par at first sight it is difficult to perceive what she is doing ; but after
\par a while the details come out magnificently. The unfortunate lady has
\par been seized by an octopus when bathing for the lady wears a bathingdress.
\par One extended arm of the octopus is in the act of coiling round
\par 'the lady's neck, and she is endeavouring to pull it off with her right
\par hand; another arm of the sea-monster is entwined round the leftwrist,
\par while the hand is fiercely tearing at the mouth of the brute.
\par The other arms of the octopus are twined round, grasping the lady's
\par body and waist in fact, her position reminds one very much of
\par Laocoon in the celebrated statue of the snakes seizing him and his
\par two sons. The sucking discs of the octopus are carved exactly as they
\par are in nature, and the colour of the body of the creature, together
\par with the formidable aspect of the eye, are wonderfully represented.
\par The face of this Japanese lady is most admirably done; it expresses
\par the utmost terror and alarm, and possibly may be a portrait. So
\par carefully is the carving executed that the lady's white teeth can be
\par seen between her lips. The hair is a perfect gem of work; it is jet
\par black, extended down the back, and tied at the end in a knot; in
\par fact, it is so well done that I can hardly bring myself to think that
\par it is not real hair, fastened on in some most ingenious manner ; but by
\par examining it under a powerful magnifying glass I find it is not so it
\par is the result of extraordinary cleverness in carving. The back of the
\par little white comb fixed into the thick of the black hair adds to the
\par effect of this magnificent carving of the hair. I congratulate Mr.
\par Bartlett on the acquisition of this most beautiful curiosity. There
\par is an inscription in Japanese characters on the underneath part of the
\par carving, and Mr. Bartlett and myself would, of course, only be too glad
\par to get this translated." Frank Buckland, in Land and Water.

\par Before the days of Darwinism, what courage was requisite
\par in a man who propounded any theory a little bit extravagant !
\par Hark how, even less than twenty years ago, the ghost of the
\par unfortunate Lord Monboddo had bricks of criticism pelted at
\par it, half earnestly, half contemptuously, by one of our greatest
\par thinkers, whose thought happened to run in grooves different
\par from those travelled in by the mind of the unfortunate
\par Scotchman.
\par " Lord Monboddo* had just finished his great work, by
\par which he derives all mankind from a couple of apes, and all
\par the dialects of the world from a language originally framed
\par by some Egyptian gods, when the discovery of Sanskrit came
\par on him like a thunderbolt. It must be said, however, to his
\par credit, that he at once perceived the immense importance of
\par the discovery. He could not be expected to sacrifice his
\par primordial monkeys or his Egyptian idols, &c."
\par And again : "It may be of interest to give one other
\par extract in order to show how well, apart from his men with,
\par and his monkeys without, tails, Lord Monboddo could sift
\par and handle the evidence that was placed before him."
\par Max Miiller also furnishes us with an amazing example
\par of scepticism on the part of Dugald Stewart. He saysf :
\par " However, if the facts about Sanskrit were true, Dugald
\par Stewart was too wise not to see that the conclusions drawn
\par from them were inevitable. He therefore denied the reality
\par of such a language as Sanskrit altogether, and wrote his
\par famous essay to prove that Sanskrit had been put together,
\par after the model of Greek and Latin, by those archforgers
\par and liars, the Brahmans, and that the whole of Sanskrit
\par literature was an imposition."

\par , MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Stories of divine progenitors, demigods, heroes, mighty
\par hunters, slayers of monsters, giants, dwarfs, gigantic serpents,
\par dragons, frightful beasts of prey, supernatural beings,
\par and myths of all kinds, appear to have been carried into all
\par corners of the world with as much fidelity as the sacred Ark
\par of the Israelites, acquiring a moulding graceful, weird or
\par uncouth according to the genius of the people or their
\par capacity for superstitious belief; and these would appear to
\par have been materially affected by the varied nature of their
\par respective countries. For example, the long-continuing
\par dwellers in the open plains of a semi-tropical region, relieved
\par to a great extent from the cares of watchfulness, and nurtured
\par in the grateful rays of a genial but not oppressive sun,
\par must have a more buoyant disposition and more open temperament
\par than those inhabiting vast forests, the matted overgrowth
\par of which rarely allows the passage of a single ray,
\par bathes all in gloom, and leaves on every side undiscovered
\par depths, filled with shapeless shadows, objects of vigilant
\par dread, from which some ferocious monster may emerge at
\par any moment. Again, on the one hand, the nomad roaming
\par in isolation over vast solitudes, having much leisure for contemplative
\par reflection, and on the other, the hardy dwellers on
\par storm-beaten coasts, by turns fishermen, mariners, and
\par pirates, must equally develop traits which affect their religion,
\par polity, and customs, and stamp their influences on mythology
\par and tradition.
\par The Greek, the Celt, and the Viking, descended from the
\par same Aryan ancestors, though all drawing from the same
\par sources their inspirations of religious belief and tradition,
\par quickly diverged, and respectively settled into a generous
\par martial race martial in support of their independence rather
\par than from any lust of conquest polite, skilled, and learned;
\par one brave but irritable, suspicious, haughty, impatient of
\par control ; and the last, the berserker, with a ruling passion
\par for maritime adventure, piracy, and hand-to-hand heroic
\par INTRODUCTION. 23
\par struggles, to be terminated in due course by a hero's death
\par and a welcome to the banqueting halls of Odin in Walhalla.
\par The beautiful mythology of the Greek nation, comprising
\par a pantheon of gods and demigods, benign for the most
\par part, and often interesting themselves directly in the welfare
\par of individual men, was surely due to, or at least greatly
\par induced by, the plastic influences of a delicious climate, a
\par semi-insular position in a sea comparatively free from stormy
\par weather, and an open mountainous country, moderately fertile.
\par Again, the gloomy and sanguinary religion of the
\par Druids was doubtless moulded by the depressing influences of
\par the seclusion, twilight haze, and dangers of the dense forests
\par in which they hid themselves forests which, as we know
\par from Caesar, spread over the greater part of Gaul, Britain,
\par and Spain ; while the Viking, having from the chance or
\par choice of his ancestors, inherited a rugged seaboard, lashed
\par by tempestuous waves and swept by howling winds, a seaboard
\par with only a rugged country shrouded with unsubdued
\par forests at its back, exposed during the major portion of the
\par year to great severity of climate, and yielding at the best but
\par a niggard and precarious harvest, became perforce a bold and
\par skilful mariner, and, translating his belief into a language
\par symbolic of his new surroundings, believed that he saw and
\par heard Thor in the midst of the howling tempests, revealed
\par majestic and terrible through rents in the storm-cloud. Pursuing
\par our consideration of the effects produced by climatic
\par conditions, may we not assume, for example, that some at
\par least of the Chaldseans, inhabiting a pastoral country, and
\par being descended from ancestors who had pursued, for hundreds
\par or thousands of years, a nomadic existence in the vast
\par open steppes in the highlands of Central Asia, were indebted
\par to those circumstances for the advance which they are credited
\par with having made in astronomy and kindred sciences. Is it
\par not possible that their acquaintance with climatology was as
\par exact or even more so than our own ? The habit of solitude
\par 24 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par would induce reflection, the subject of which would naturally
\par be the causes influencing the vicissitudes of weather. The
\par possibilities of rain or sunshine, wind or storm, would
\par be with them a prominent object of solicitude ; and the
\par necessity, in an unfenced country, of extending their watch
\par over their flocks and herds throughout the night, would perforce
\par more or less rivet their attention upon the glorious
\par constellations of the heavens above, and lead to habits of
\par observation which, systematized and long continued by the
\par priesthood, might have produced deductions accurate in the
\par result even if faulty in the process.
\par The vast treasures of ancient knowledge tombed in the
\par ruins of Babylon and Assyria, of which the recovery and deciphering
\par is as yet only initiated, may, to our surprise, reveal
\par that certain secrets of philosophy were known to the
\par ancients equally with ourselves, but lost through intervening
\par ages by the destruction of the empire, and the fact of their
\par conservancy having been entrusted to a privileged and limited
\par order, with which it perished.*
\par * Mr. C. P. Daly, President of the American Geographical Society,
\par informs us, in his Annual Address [for 1880], that in one book found in
\par the royal library at Nineveh, of the date 2000 B.C., there is
\par 1. A catalogue of stars.
\par 2. Enumeration of twelve constellations forming our present zodiac.
\par 3. The intimation of a Sabbath.
\par 4. A connection indicated (according to Mr. Perville) between the
\par weather and the changes of the moon.
\par 5. A notice of the spots on the sun : a fact they could only have
\par known by the aid of telescopes, which it is supposed they possessed
\par from observations that they have noted down of the rising of Venus,
\par the fact that Layard found a crystal lens in the ruins of Nineveh.
\par (KB. As to the above, 1 must say that telescopes are not always
\par necessary to see the spots on the sun : these were distinctly visible with
\par the naked eye, in the early mornings, to myself and the officers of the
\par S.S. Scotia, in the Eed Sea, in the month of August of 1883, after the
\par great volcanic disturbances near Batavia. The resulting atmospheric
\par effects were very marked in the Eed Sea, as elsewhere, the sun, when
\par near the horizon, appearing of a pale green colour, and exhibiting the
\par spots distinctly.)
\par INTRODUCTION. 25
\par We hail as a new discovery the knowledge of the existence
\par of the so-called spots upon the surface of the sun, and scientists,
\par from long-continued observations, profess to distinguish a
\par connection between the character of these and atmospheric
\par phenomena ; they even venture to predict floods and droughts,
\par and that for some years in anticipation ; while pestilences or
\par some great disturbance are supposed to be likely to follow the
\par period when three or four planets attain their apogee within
\par one year, a supposition based on the observations extended
\par over numerous years, that similar events had accompanied
\par the occurrence of even one only of those positions at previous
\par periods.
\par May we not speculate on the possibility of similar or parallel
\par knowledge having been possessed by the old Chaldaean and
\par Egyptian priesthood ; and may not Joseph have been able, by
\par superior ability in its exercise, to have anticipated the seven
\par years' drought, or Noah, from an acquaintance with meteorological
\par science, to have made an accurate forecast of the great
\par disturbances which resulted in the Deluge and the destruction
\par of a large portion of mankind ? *
\par * Ammianus Marcellinus (bk. xxii., ch. xv., s. 20), in speaking of
\par the Pyramids, says :
\par " There are also subterranean passages and winding
\par retreats, which, it is said, men skilful in the ancient mysteries, by means
\par of which they divined the coming of a flood, constructed in different
\par places lest the memory of all their sacred ceremonies should be lost."
\par As affording a minor example of prophesy, I quote a correspondent's
\par communication, relating to Siam, to the North China Daily News of
\par July 28th, 1881 :
\par "
\par Singularly enough the prevalence of cholera in
\par Siam this season has been predicted for some months. The blossoming
\par of the bamboo (which in India is considered the invariable forerunner
\par of an epidemic) was looked upon as ominous, while the enormous quantity
\par and high quality of the fruit produced was cited as pointing out the overcharge
\par of the earth with matter which, though tending to the development
\par of vegetable life, is deleterious to human. From these and other sources
\par of knowledge open to those accustomed to read the book of nature, the
\par prevalence of cholera, which, since 1873, has been almost unknown in
\par Siam, was predicted and looked for ; and, unlike most modern predic26
\par MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Without further digression in a path which opens the most
\par pleasing speculations, and could be pursued into endless
\par ramifications, I will merely, in conclusion, suggest that the
\par same influences which, as I have shown above, affect so
\par largely the very nature of a people, must similarly affect its
\par traditions and myths, and that due consideration will have
\par to be given to such influences, in the case of some at least of
\par the remarkable animals which I propose to discuss in this
\par and future volumes.
\par tions, it has been certainly fulfilled. So common was the belief, that
\par when, some months since, a foreign official in Siamese employ applied
\par for leave of absence, it was opposed by some of the native officials on
\par the ground that he ought to stay and take his chance of the cholera with
\par the rest of them."

\par CHAPTER I.
\par ON SOME REMARKABLE ANIMAL FORMS.
\par THE reasoning upon the question whether dragons, winged
\par snakes, sea-serpents, unicorns, and other so-called fabulous
\par monsters have in reality existed, and at dates coeval with
\par man, diverges in several independent directions.
\par We have to consider :
\par 1. Whether the characters attributed to these creatures
\par are or are not so abnormal in comparison with those of known
\par types, as to render a belief in their existence impossible or
\par the reverse.
\par 2. Whether it is rational to suppose that creatures so
\par formidable, and apparently so capable of self-protection,
\par should disappear entirely, while much more defenceless
\par species continue to survive them.
\par 3. The myths, traditions, and historical allusions from
\par which their reality may be inferred require to be classified
\par and annotated, and full weight given to the evidence which
\par has accumulated of the presence of man upon the earth
\par during ages long prior to the historic period, and which
\par may have been ages of slowly progressive civilization, or
\par perhaps cycles of alternate light and darkness, of knowledge
\par and barbarism.
\par 4. Lastly, some inquiry may be made into the geographical
\par conditions obtaining at the time of their possible
\par existence.
\par 32 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par It is immaterial which of these investigations is first
\par entered upon, and it will, in fact, be more convenient to
\par defer a portion of them until we arrive at the sections of this
\par volume treating specifically of the different objects to which
\par it is devoted, and to confine our attention for the present to
\par those subjects which, from their nature, are common and
\par in a sense prefatory to the whole subject.
\par I shall therefore commence with a short examination of
\par some of the most remarkable reptilian forms which are
\par known to have existed, and for that purpose, and to show
\par their general relations, annex the accompanying tables,
\par compiled from the anatomy of vertebrated animals by

\par anterior limb. The generic differences are based upon the
\par comparative lengths of the tail, and upon the dentition. In
\par Pterodactylus (see Fig. 2, p. 18), the tail is very short, and
\par the jaws strong, pointed, and toothed to their anterior extremities.
\par In Rhamphorynchus (see Fig. 3, p. 18), the tail is
\par very long and the teeth are not continuous to the extremities
\par of the jaws, which are produced into toothless beaks. The
\par majority of the species are small, and they are generally
\par considered to have been inoffensive creatures, having much
\par the habits and insectivorous mode of living of bats. One
\par British species, however, from the white chalk of Maidstone,
\par measures more than sixteen feet across the outstretched
\par wings; and other forms recently discovered by Professor
\par Marsh in the Upper Cretaceous deposits of Kansas, attain
\par the gigantic proportions of nearly twenty-five feet for the
\par same measurements; and although these were devoid of
\par teeth (thus approaching the class Aves still more closely),
\par they could hardly fail, from their magnitude and powers of
\par flight, to have been formidable, and must, with their weird
\par aspects, and long outstretched necks and pointed heads,
\par have been at least sufficiently alarming.
\par We need go no farther than these in search of creatures
\par which would realise the popular notion of the winged
\par dragon.
\par The harmless little flying lizards, belonging to the genus
\par Draco, abounding in the East Indian archipelago, which have
\par many of their posterior ribs prolonged into an expansion of
\par the integument, unconnected with the limbs, and have a
\par limited and parachute-like flight, need only the element of
\par size, to render them also sufficiently to be dreaded, and
\par capable of rivalling the Pterodactyls in suggesting the
\par general idea of the same monster.
\par It is, however, when we pass to some of the other groups,
\par that we find ourselves in the presence of forms so vast and
\par terrible, as to more than realise the most exaggerated imOJ\\

\par pression of reptilian power and ferocity which the florid
\par imagination of man can conceive.
\par We have long been acquainted with numerous gigantic
\par terrestrial Saurians, ranging throughout the whole of the
\par Mesozoic formations, such as Iguanodon (characteristic of the
\par Wealden), Megalosaurus (Great Saurian), and Hylceosaurus
\par (Forest Saurian), huge bulky creatures, the last of which,
\par at least, was protected by dermal armour partially produced
\par into prodigious spines ; as well as with remarkable forms
\par essentially marine, such as Icthyosaurus (Pish-like Saurian),
\par Plesiosaurus, &c., adapted to an oceanic existence and propelling
\par themselves by means of paddles. The latter, it may
\par be remarked, was furnished with a long slender swan-like
\par neck, which, carried above the surface of the water, would
\par present the appearance of the anterior portion of a serpent.
\par To the related land forms the collective term Dinosauria
\par (from 8eti/os " terrible
\par ;
\par ') has been applied, in signification of
\par the power which their structure and magnitude imply that
\par they possessed ; and to the others that of Enaliosauria, as
\par expressive of their adaptation to a maritime existence. Yet,
\par wonderful to relate, those creatures which have for so many
\par years commanded our admiration fade into insignificance in

\par Jurassic periods, by which they are surpassed,' in point of
\par magnitude, as much as they themselves exceed the mass
\par of the larger Vertebrata.
\par Take, for example, those referred to by Professor Marsh in
\par the course of an address to the American Association for the
\par Advancement of Science, in 1877, in the following terms :
\par ' ' The reptiles most characteristic of our American cretaceous
\par strata are the Mososauria, a group with very few representatives
\par in other parts of the world. In our cretaceous seas

\par they rule supreme, as their numbers, size, and carnivorous
\par habits enabled them to easily vanquish all rivals. Some
\par were at least sixty feet in length, and the smallest ten or
\par twelve. In the inland cretaceous sea from which the Rocky
\par Mountains were beginning to emerge, these ancient ' seaserpents
\par '
\par abounded, and many were entombed in its muddy
\par bottom ; on one occasion, as I rode through a valley washed
\par out of this old ocean-bed, I saw no less than seven different
\par skeletons of these monsters in sight at once. The Mososauria
\par were essentially swimming lizards with four welldeveloped
\par paddles, and they had little affinity with modern
\par serpents, to which they have been compared."
\par Or, again, notice the specimens of the genus Cidastes,
\par which are also described as veritable sea-serpents of those
\par ancient seas, whose huge bones and almost incredible number
\par of vertebrae show them to have attained a length of nearly
\par two hundred feet. The remains of no less than ten of these
\par monsters were seen by Professor Mudge, while riding through
\par the Mauvaise Terres of Colorado, strewn upon the plains,
\par their whitened bones bleached in the suns of centuries, and
\par their gaping jaws armed with ferocious teeth, telling a
\par wonderful tale of their power when alive.
\par The same deposits have been equally fertile in the remains
\par of terrestrial animals of gigantic size. The Titanosaurus
\par montanus, believed to have been herbivorous, is estimated to
\par have reached fifty or sixty feet in length ; while other Dinosaurians
\par of still more gigantic proportions, from the Jurassic
\par beds of the Rocky Mountains, have been described by Professor
\par Marsh. Among the discovered remains of Atlantosaurus
\par immanis is a femur over six feet in length, and it is estimated
\par from a comparison of this specimen with the same bone in
\par living reptiles that this species, if similar in proportions to
\par the crocodile, would have been over one hundred feet in
\par length.
\par But even yet the limit has not been reached, and we hear
\par ON SOME REMARKABLE ANIMAL FORMS.
\par of the discovery of the remains of another form, of such
\par Titanic proportions as to possess a thigh-bone over twelve
\par feet in length.

\par From these considerations it is evident that, on account of
\par the dimensions usually assigned to them, no discredit can be
\par attached to the existence of the fabulous monsters of which
\par we shall speak hereafter; for these, in the various myths,
\par rarely or never equal in size creatures which science
\par shows to have existed in a comparatively recent geological
\par age, while the quaintest conception could hardly equal
\par the reality of yet another of the American Dinosaurs,
\par Stegosaurus, which appears to have been herbivorous, and
\par more or less aquatic in habit, adapted for sitting upon its
\par hinder extremities, and protected by bony plate and numerous
\par spines. It reached thirty feet in length. Professor
\par Marsh considers that this, when alive, must have presented
\par the strangest appearance of all the Dinosaurs yet discovered.
\par The affinities of birds and reptiles have been so clearly
\par demonstrated of late years, as to cause Professor Huxley and
\par many other comparative anatomists to bridge over the wide
\par gap which was formerly considered to divide the two classes,
\par and to bracket them together in one class, to which the name
\par Sauropsidse has been given.*
\par There are, indeed, not a few remarkable forms, as to the
\par class position of which, whether they should be assigned to

\par and the close affinity of the latter with recent struthious birds
\par will hardly be questioned. The case amounts almost to a demonstration
\par if we compare with Dinosaurs their contemporaries, the Mesozoic birds.
\par The classes of birds and reptiles as now living are separated by a gulf
\par so profound that a few years since it was cited by the opponents of
\par evolution as the most important break in the animal series, and one
\par which that doctrine could not bridge over. Since then, as Huxley has
\par clearly shown, this gap has -been virtually filled by the discoveries of
\par bird-like reptiles and reptilian birds. Compsognathus and Archseopteryx

\par to the former, but arguments against this disposal of it

\par CHAPTER II.
\par EXTINCTION OF SPECIES.
\par IN reviewing the past succession of different forms of ancient
\par life upon the globe, we are reminded of a series of dissolving
\par views, in which each species evolves itself by an imperceptible
\par gradation from some pre-existing one, arrives at its maximum
\par of individuality, and then slowly fades away, while another
\par type, either higher or lower, evolved in turn from it, emerges
\par from obscurity, and succeeds it on the field of view.
\par Specific individuality has in all cases a natural term, dependent
\par on physical causes, but that term is in many cases
\par abruptly anticipated by a combination of unfavourable conditions.
\par Alteration of climate, isolation by geological changes, such
\par as the submergence of continents and islands, and the competition
\par of other species, are among the causes which have
\par at all times operated towards its destruction ; while, since the
\par evolution of man, his agency, so far as we can judge by what
\par we know of his later history, has been especially active in
\par the same direction.
\par The limited distribution of many species, even when not
\par enforced by insular conditions, is remarkable, and, of course,
\par highly favourable to their destruction. A multiplicity of
\par examples are familiar to naturalists, and possibly not a
\par few may have attracted the attention of the ordinary observer.
\par EXTINCTION OF SPECIES. 43
\par For instance, it is probably generally known, that in our
\par own island, the red grouse (which, by the way, is a species
\par peculiar to Great Britain) is confined to certain moorlands,
\par the ruffs and reeves to fen districts, and the nightingale,*
\par chough, and other species to a few counties ; while Ireland
\par is devoid of almost all the species of reptiles common to
\par Great Britain. In the former cases, the need of or predilection
\par for certain foods probably determines the favourite
\par locality, and there are few countries which would not furnish
\par similar examples. In the latter, the explanation depends on
\par biological conditions dating prior to the separation of Ireland
\par from the main continent. Among birds, it might fairly be
\par presumed that the power of flight would produce unlimited
\par territorial expansion, but in many instances the reverse is
\par found to be the case : a remarkable example being afforded
\par by the island of Tasmania, a portion of which is called the
\par unsettled waste lands, or Western Country. This district,
\par which comprises about one-third of the island upon the
\par western side, and is mainly composed of mountain chains of
\par granites, quartzite, and mica schists, is entirely devoid of the
\par numerous species of garrulous and gay-plumaged birds, such
\par as the Mynah mocking-bird, white cockatoo, wattle bird, and
\par Eosella parrot, though these abundantly enliven the eastern
\par districts, which are fertilized by rich soils due to the presence
\par of ranges of basalt, greenstone, and other trappean rocks.
\par Another equally striking instance is given by my late
\par father, Mr. J. Gould, in his work on the humming-birds.
\par Of two species, inhabiting respectively the adjacent moun-
\par * " It enters Europe early in April, spreads over France, Britain,
\par Denmark, and the south of Sweden, which it reaches by the beginning
\par of May. It does not enter Brittany, the Channel Islands, or the western
\par part of England, never visiting Wales, except the extreme south of
\par Glamorganshire, and rarely extending farther north than Yorkshire."
\par A. E. Wallace, Geographical Distribution of Animals, vol. i. p. 21.
\par London, 1876.
\par 44 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par tains of Pichincha and Chimborazo at certain elevations, each
\par is strictly confined to its own mountain ; and, if my memory
\par serves me correctly, he mentions similar instances of species
\par peculiar to different peaks of the Andes.
\par Limitation by insular isolation is intelligible, especially in
\par the case of mammals and reptiles, and of birds possessing
\par but small power of flight ; and we are, therefore, not surprised
\par to find Mr. Gosse indicating, among other examples,
\par that even the smallest of the Antilles has each a fauna of its
\par own, while the humming-birds, some of the parrots, cuckoos,
\par and pigeons, and many of the smaller birds are peculiar to
\par Jamaica. He states still further, that in the latter instance
\par many of the animals are not distributed over the whole
\par island, but confined to a single small district.
\par Continental limitation is effected by mountain barriers.
\par Thus, according to Mr. Wallace, almost all the mammalia,
\par birds, and insects on one side of the Andes and Eocky
\par Mountains are distinct in species from those on the
\par other ; while a similar difference, but smaller in degree,
\par exists with reference to regions adjacent to the Alps and
\par Pyrenees.
\par Climate, broad rivers, seas, oceans, forests, and even large
\par desert wastes, like the Sahara or the great desert of Gobi,
\par also act more or less effectively as girdles which confine
\par species within certain limits.
\par Dependence on each other or on supplies of appropriate
\par food also form minor yet practical factors in the sum of
\par limitation ; and a curious example of the first is given by
\par Dr. Van Lennep with reference to the small migratory birds
\par that are unable to perform the flight of three hundred and
\par fifty miles across the Mediterranean. He states that these
\par are carried across on the backs of cranes.*

\par Quoted in Nature, March 24, 1881.
\par EXTINCTION OF SPECIES. 45
\par In the autumn many flocks of cranes may be seen coming from the
\par North, with the first cold blast from that quarter, flying low, and uttering
\par a peculiar cry, as if of alarm, as they circle over the cultivated
\par plains. Little birds of every species may be seen flying up to them,
\par while the twittering cries of those already comfortably settled upon
\par their backs may be distinctly heard. On their return in the spring they
\par fly high, apparently considering that their little passengers can easily
\par find their way down to the earth.
\par The question of food-supply is involved in the more
\par extended subject of geological structure, as controlling the
\par flora and the insect life dependent on it. As an example
\par we may cite the disappearance of the capercailzie from
\par Denmark with the decay of the pine forests abundant during
\par late Tertiary periods.
\par Collision, direct or indirect, with inimical species often
\par has a fatal ending. Thus the dodo was exterminated by the
\par swine which the early visitors introduced to the Mauritius
\par and permitted to run wild there ; while the indigenous insects,
\par mollusca, and perhaps some of the birds of St. Helena,
\par disappeared as soon as the introduction of goats caused the
\par destruction of the whole flora of forest trees.
\par The Tsetse fly extirpates all horses, dogs, and cattle, from
\par certain districts of South Africa, and a representative species
\par in Paraguay is equally fatal to new-born cattle and horses.
\par Mr. Darwin * shows that the struggle is more severe
\par between species of the same genus, when they come into
\par competition with each other, than between species of distinct
\par genera. Thus one species of swallow has recently expelled
\par another from part of the United States; and the misselthrush
\par has driven the song-thrush from part of Scotland.
\par In Australia the imported hive-bee is rapidly exterminating
\par the small stingless native bee, and similar cases might be
\par found in any number.
\par Mr. Wallace, in quoting Mr. Darwin as to these facts,
\par points the conclusion that "
\par any slight change, therefore,
\par *
\par Origin of Species, C. Darwin, 5th edit. 1869.
\par 46 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par of physical geography or of climate, which allows allied
\par species hitherto inhabiting distinct areas to come into
\par contact, will often lead to the extermination of one of them."
\par It is the province of the palaeontologist to enumerate the
\par many remarkable forms which have passed away since man's
\par first appearance upon the globe, and to trace their fluctuations
\par over both hemispheres as determined by the advance and
\par retreat of glacial conditions, and by the protean forms
\par assumed by past and existing continents under oscillations
\par of elevation and depression. Many interesting points, such
\par as the dates of the successive separation of Ireland and
\par Great Britain from the main continent, can be determined
\par with accuracy from the record furnished by the fossil remains
\par of animals of those times ; and many interesting associations
\par of animals with man at various dates, in our present island
\par home and in other countries, have been traced by the
\par discovery of their remains in connection with his, in bone
\par deposits in caverns and elsewhere.
\par Conversely, most valuable deductions are drawn by the
\par zoologist from the review which he is enabled to take,
\par through the connected labours of his colleagues in all
\par departments, of the distinct life regions now mapped out
\par upon the face of the globe. These, after the application of
\par the necessary corrections for various disturbing or controlling
\par influences referred to above, afford proof reaching far back
\par into past periods, of successive alterations in the disposition
\par of continents and oceans, and of connections long since
\par obliterated between distant lands.
\par The palaeontologist reasons from the past to the present,
\par the zoologist from the present to the past ; and their mutual
\par labours explain the evolution of existing forms, and the
\par causes of the disparity or connection between those at
\par present characterizing the different portions of the surface of
\par the globe.
\par The palaeontologist, for example, traces the descent of the
\par EXTINCTION OF SPECIES. 47
\par horse, which, until its reintroduction by the Spaniards was
\par unknown in the New World, through a variety of intermediate
\par forms, to the genus Orohippus occurring in Eocene
\par deposits in Utah and Wyoming. This animal was no larger
\par than a fox, and possessed four separated toes in front, and
\par three behind. Domestic cattle he refers to the Bos primigenius,
\par and many existing Carnivora to Tertiary forms such
\par as the cave-bear, cave-lion, sabre-tiger, and the like.
\par The zoologist groups the existing fauna into distinct
\par provinces, and demands, in explanation of the anomalies
\par which these exhibit, the reconstruction of large areas, of
\par which only small outlying districts remain at the present
\par date, in many instances widely separated by oceans, though
\par once forming parts of the same continent; and so, for the
\par simile readily suggests itself, the workers in another branch
\par of science, Philology, argue from words and roots scattered
\par like fossils through the various dialects of very distant
\par countries, a mutual descent from a common Aryan language :
\par the language of a race of which no historical record exists,
\par though in regard to its habits, customs, and distribution much
\par may be affirmed from the large collection of word specimens
\par stored in philological museums.
\par Thus Mr. Sclater, on zoological grounds, claims the late
\par existence of a continent which he calls Lemuria, extending
\par from Madagascar to Ceylon and Sumatra ; and for similar
\par reasons Mr. Wallace extends the Australia of Tertiary
\par periods to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and perhaps
\par to Fiji, and from its marsupial types infers a connection
\par with the northern continent during the Secondary period.
\par Again, the connection of Europe with North Africa during
\par a late geological period is inferred by many zoologists
\par from the number of identical species of mammalia inhabiting
\par the opposite sides of the Mediterranean, and palaeontologists
\par confirm this by the discovery of the remains of
\par elephants in cave-deposits in Malta, and of hippopotami in
\par 48 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Gibraltar; while hydrographers furnish the supplemental
\par suggestive evidence that an elevation of only fifteen hundred
\par feet would be sufficient to establish two broad connections
\par between the two continents so as to unite Italy with
\par Tripoli and Spain with Morocco, and to convert the Mediterranean
\par Sea into two great lakes, which appears, in fact, to
\par have been its condition during the Pliocene and Post Pliocene
\par periods.
\par It was by means of these causeways that the large pachyderms
\par entered Britain, then united to the continent ; and
\par it was over them they retreated when driven back by glacial
\par conditions, their migration northward being effectually prevented
\par by the destruction of the connecting arms of land.
\par Some difference of opinion exists among naturalists as
\par to the extent to which zoological regions should be subdivided,
\par and as to their respective limitations.
\par But Mr. A. R. Wallace, who has most recently written
\par on the subject, is of opinion that the original division proposed
\par by Mr. Sclater in 1857 is the most tenable, and he
\par therefore adopts it in the very exhaustive work upon the
\par geographical distribution of animals which he has recently
\par issued. Mr. Sclater's Six Regions are as follows :
\par 1. The Palcearctic Region, including Europe, Temperate
\par Asia, and North Africa to the Atlas mountains.
\par 2. The Ethiopian Region, Africa south of the Atlas,
\par Madagascar, and the Mascarene islands, with
\par Southern Arabia.
\par 3. The Indian Region, including India south of the
\par Himalayas, to South China, and to Borneo and Java.
\par 4. The Australian Region, including Celebes and Lombok,
\par Eastward to Australia and the Pacific islands.
\par 5. The Nearctic Region, including Greenland, and North
\par America, to Northern Mexico.
\par 6. The Neotropical Region, including South America, the
\par Antilles, and Southern Mexico.
\par EXTINCTION OF SPECIES. 49
\par This arrangement is based upon a detailed examination of
\par the chief genera and families of birds, and also very nearly
\par represents the distribution of mammals and of reptiles. Its
\par regions are not, as in other subsequently proposed and more
\par artificial systems, controlled by climate ; for they range, in
\par some instances, from the pole to the tropics. It probably
\par approaches more nearly than any other yet proposed to that
\par desideratum, a division of the earth into regions, founded
\par on a collation of the groups of forms indigenous to or typical
\par of them, and upon a selection of those peculiar to them ; with
\par a disregard of, or only admitting with caution, any which,
\par though common to and apparently establishing connection
\par between two or more regions, may have in fact but little
\par value for the purpose of such comparison ; from the fact of
\par its being possible to account for their extended range by
\par their capability of easy transport from one region to another
\par by common natural agencies.*
\par Such an arrangement should be consistent with the retrospective
\par information afforded by palaeontology ; and, taking
\par an extended view of the subject, be not merely a catalogue
\par * Thus Mr. Wallace considers that the identity of the small fish,
\par Galaxias attenuatus, which occurs in the mountain streams of Tasmania,
\par with one found in those of New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and the
\par temperate regions of South America, cannot be considered as demonstrating
\par a land connection between these places within the period of
\par its specific existence. For there is a possibility that its ova have
\par been transported from one point to another on floating ice; and for
\par similar reasons fresh-water fish generally are unsafe guides to a
\par classification of zoological regions. Mr. Darwin has shown (Origin of
\par Species, and Nature, vol. xviii. p. 120 and vol. xxv. p. 529) that mollusca
\par can be conveyed attached to or entangled in the claws of migratory
\par birds. Birds themselves are liable to be blown great distances by
\par gales of wind. Beetles and other flying insects may be similarly
\par transferred. Reptiles are occasionally conveyed on floating logs and
\par uprooted trees. Mammals alone appear to be really trustworthy guides
\par towards such a classification, from their being less liable than the
\par other classes to accidental dispersion.

\par of the present, but also an index of the past. It should
\par afford an illustration of an existing phase of the distribution
\par of animal life, considered as the last of a long series of similar
\par phases which have successively resulted from changes in the
\par disposition of land and water, and from other controlling
\par agencies, throughout all time. A reconstruction of the areas
\par respectively occupied by the sea and the land at different
\par geological periods will be possible, or at least greatly facilitated,
\par when a complete system of similar groupings, illustrative
\par of each successive period, has been compiled.
\par It is obvious that any great cosmical change, affecting to
\par a wide extent any of the regions, might determine a destruction
\par of specific existence ; and this on a large scale, in comparison
\par with the change which is always progressing in a
\par smaller degree in the different and isolated divisions.
\par The brief remarks which I have made on this subject are
\par intended to suggest, rather than to demonstrate which could
\par only be done by a lengthy series of examples the causes
\par influencing specific existence and its in many cases extreme
\par frailty of tenure. And I shall now conclude by citing from
\par the works of Lyell and Wallace a short list of notable
\par species, now extinct, whose remains have been collected
\par from late Tertiary, and Post Tertiary deposits that is to
\par say, at a time subsequent to the appearance of man. From
\par other authors I have extracted an enumeration of species
\par which have become locally or entirely extinct within the
\par historic period.
\par These instances will, I think, be sufficient to show that,
\par as similar destructive causes must have been in action
\par during pre-historic times, it is probable that, besides those
\par remarkable animals of which remains have been discovered,
\par many others which then existed may have perished without
\par leaving any trace of their existence. There is, consequently,
\par a possibility that some at least of the so-called myths
\par respecting extraordinary creatures, hitherto considered fabuEXTINCTION

\par lous, may merely be distorted accounts traditions of species
\par as yet unrecognised by Science, which have actually existed,
\par and that not remotely, as man's congener.

\par THE MAMMOTH. Among other remarkable forms whose
\par remains have been discovered in those later deposits, in
\par which geologists are generally agreed that remains of man
\par or traces of his handicraft have also been recognised, there
\par is one which stands out prominently both for its magnitude
\par and extensive range in time and space. Although the animal
\par itself is now entirely extinct, delineations by the hand of
\par Palaeolithic man have been preserved, and even frozen carcases,
\par with the flesh uncorrupted and fit for food, have been
\par occasionally discovered.
\par This is the mammoth, the Elephas primigenius of Blumenbach,
\par a gigantic elephant nearly a third taller than the
\par largest modern species, and twice its weight. Its body was

\par protected from the severity of the semi-arctic conditions
\par under which it flourished by a dense covering of reddish
\par wool, and long black hair, and its head was armed or ornamented
\par with tusks exceeding twelve feet in length, and

\par long been, and still is, a valuable article of commerce, more

\par in North America, near Behring's straits, where entire
\par skeletons are occasionally discovered, and where even the
\par nature of its food has been ascertained from the undigested
\par contents of its stomach.
\par There is a well-known case recorded of a specimen found
\par (1799), frozen and encased in ice, at the mouth of the Lena.
\par It was sixteen feet long, and the flesh was so well preserved
\par that the Yakuts used it as food for their dogs. But similar
\par instances occurred previously, for we find the illustrious
\par savant and Emperor Kang Hi [A.D. 1662 to 1723] penning
\par the following note* upon what could only have been this
\par species :
\par " The cold is extreme, and nearly continuous on the
\par coasts of the northern sea beyond Tai-Tong-Kiang. It is
\par on this coast that the animal called Fen Chou is found, the

\par the light. There is obtained from it an ivory as white as
\par that of the elephant, but easier to work, and which will not

\par in these terms :
\par ' There is in the depths of the north a rat
\par which weighs as much as a thousand pounds ; its flesh is very
\par good for those who are heated.' The Tsee-Chou calls it Tai-
\par Chou and speaks of another species which is not so large. It

\par says that this is as big as a buffalo, buries itself like a mole,

\par anxious to procure of them is the part which forms their
\par weapon of defence, by Juba called their horns, but by Herodotus,
\par a much older writer, as well as by general usage, and
\par more appropriately, their teeth. Hence it is that, when
\par these tusks have fallen off, either from accident or old age,
\par they bury them in the earth."
\par Nordenskjold f states that the savages with whom he came
\par in contact frequently offered to him very fine mammoth
\par tusks, and tools made of mammoth ivory. He computes
\par that since the conquest of Siberia, useful tusks from more
\par than twenty thousand animals have been collected.

\par for the most part only an agglomeration of sand, of ice, and
\par of elephants' teeth. At every tempest the sea casts ashore
\par new quantities of mammoth's tusks, and the inhabitants of

\par Mr. Dawkins, reviewing all the discoveries, considers that
\par its range, at various periods, extended over the whole of
\par Northern Europe, and as far south as Spain ; over Northern
\par Asia, and North America down to the Isthmus of Darien.
\par Dr. Falconer believes it to have had an elastic constitution,
\par which enabled it to adapt itself to great change of
\par climate.
\par Murchison, De Verneuil, and Keyserling believed that
\par this species, as well as the woolly rhinoceros, belonged to
\par the Tertiary fauna of Northern Asia, though not appearing
\par until the Quaternary period in Europe.
\par Mr. Dawkins shows it to have been pre-glacial, glacial,
\par and post-glacial in Britain and in Europe, and, from its
\par relation to the intermediate species Elephas armeniacus,
\par accepts it as the ancestor of the existing Indian elephant.
\par Its disappearance was rapid, but not in the opinion of most
\par geologists cataclysmic, as suggested by Mr. Howorth.
\par Another widely distributed species was the Rhinoceros tichorhinus
\par the smooth-skinned rhinoceros also called the woolly
\par rhinoceros and the Siberian rhinoceros, which had two horns,
\par and, like the mammoth, was covered with woolly hair. Itattained
\par a great size ; a specimen, the carcase of which was
\par found by Pallas imbedded in frozen soil near Wilui, in
\par Siberia (1772), was eleven and a half feet in length. Its
\par horns are considered by some of the native tribes of northern
\par Asia to have been the talons of gigantic birds ; and Ermann
\par and Middendorf suppose that their discovery may have originated
\par the accounts by Herodotus of the gold-bearing griffons
\par and the arimaspi.
\par Its food, ascertained by Von Brandt, and others, from
\par portions remaining in the hollows of its teeth, consisted of
\par leaves and needles of trees still existing in Siberia. The
\par range of this species northwards was as extensive as that of

\par the mammoth, but its remains have not yet been discovered
\par south of the Alps and Pyrenees.
\par The investigation,* made by M. E. Lartet in 1860, of the
\par contents of the Grotto of Aurignac, in the department of the
\par Haute Garonne, from which numerous human skeletons had
\par been previously removed in 1852, shows that this animal was
\par included among the species used as ordinary articles of food,
\par or as exceptional items at the funeral feasts of the Palaeolithic
\par troglodytes. In the layers of charcoal and ashes immediately
\par outside the entrance to the grotto, and surrounding what is
\par supposed to have been the hearth, the bones of a young
\par Rhinoceros tichorhinus were found, which had been split open
\par for the extraction of the marrow. Numerous other species
\par had been dealt with in the same manner ; and all these
\par having received this treatment, and showing marks of the
\par action of fire, had evidently been carried to the cave for
\par banqueting purposes. The remains of Herbivora associated
\par with those of this rhinoceros, consisted of bones of the
\par mammoth, the horse (Equus caballus), stag (Cervus elaphus),
\par elk (Megaceros hibernicus), roebuck (C. capreolus), reindeer
\par (C. tarandus), auroch (Bison europceus.) Among carnivora
\par were found remains of Ursus spelceus (cave-bear), Ursus

\par (polecat), Hycena spelcea (cave-hyaena), Felis spelcea (cave-lion),
\par Felis catus ferus (wild cat), Canis lupus (wolf), Canis vulpis
\par (fox). Within the grotto were also found remains of Felis
\par spelcea (cave-lion) and Sus scrofa (pig). The cave-bear, the
\par fox, and indeed most of these, probably also formed articles
\par of diet, but the hyaena seems to have been a post attendant
\par at the feast, and to have rooted out and gnawed off the

\par And flint implements, and pointed javelin-heads made of

\par of the old hearths established by Palaeolithic man in the
\par cave called the Trou du Bureau, on the river Malignee in
\par Belgium.
\par In the cavern of Goyet, also in Belgium, there are five
\par bone layers, alternating with six beds of alluvial deposits,
\par showing that the cave had been inhabited by different species
\par at various periods. The lion was succeeded by the cavebear,
\par and this by hyaenas ; then Palaeolithic man became a
\par tenant and has left his bones there, together with flint implements
\par and remains of numerous species, including those
\par already enumerated as his contemporaries.
\par THE SABRE-TOOTHED TIGEE OR LION. This species,
\par Machairodus* latifrons of Owen, was remarkable for having
\par long sabre-shaped canines. It belongs to an extinct genus,
\par of which four other species are known, characterised by the
\par possession of serrated teeth. The genus is known to be
\par represented in the Auvergne beds between the Eocene and
\par Miocene, in the Miocene of Greece and India, in the Pliocene
\par of South America and Europe, and in the Pleistocene.
\par Mr. Dawkins believes that this species survived to postglacial

\par in cave deposits at Kent's Hole, near Torquay,

\par It occurs in the Cromer Forest Bed, a deposit referred by
\par Mr. Boyd Dawkins to the early part of the Glacial period,
\par and generally regarded as transitional between the Pliocene
\par and Quaternary. It is also found in the caves of Perigaud,
\par which are considered to belong to the reindeer era of
\par M. Lartet or the opening part of the Recent period, and
\par numerous discoveries of its remains at dates intermediate to
\par these have been made in Britain and ,m Europe. Carl
\par Vogt, indeed, is of opinion that this species is the progenitor
\par of our living brown bear, Ursus arctos, and Mr. Boyd Dawkins
\par also says that those " who have compared the French,
\par German, and British specimens, gradually realize the .fact
\par that the fossil remains of the bears form a graduated series,
\par in which all the variations that at first sight appear specific
\par vanish away."
\par It has been identified by Mr. Busk among the associated
\par mammalian bones of the Brixham cave. Its remains are
\par very abundant in the bone deposit of the Trou de Sureau in
\par Belgium, and in the cavern of G-oyet, which it tenanted
\par alternately with the lion and hyaena, and, like them, appears
\par to have preyed on man and the larger mammalia.
\par Mr. Prestwich has obtained it in low-level deposits of river
\par gravels in the valleys of the north of France and south of
\par England, and it has been obtained from the Loss, a loamy,
\par usually unstratified deposit, which is extensively distributed
\par over central Europe, in the valleys of the Rhine, Rhone,
\par Danube, and other great rivers. This deposit is considered
\par by Mr. Prestwich to be equivalent to other high-level gravels
\par of the Pleistocene period.
\par THE MASTODON. The generic title Mastodon has been
\par applied to a number of species allied to the elephants, but
\par distinguished from them by a peculiar structure of the molar
\par teeth ; these are rectangular, and in their upper surfaces
\par exhibit a number of great conical tuberosities with rounded
\par points disposed in pairs, to the number of four or five,
\par EXTINCTION OF SPECIES. 59
\par according to the species; whereas in the elephants they
\par are broad and uniform, and regularly marked with furrows
\par of large curvature. The mastodons, in addition to large
\par tusks in the premaxillse, like those of the elephant, had also
\par in most instances, a pair of shorter ones in the mandible.

\par of the Sivalik hills, and four species of mastodon in all
\par are known to have ranged over India during those periods.
\par In Pliocene deposits we have abundant remains of
\par M. arvernensis, and M. longirostris from the Val d'Arno in
\par Italy, and the M. Borsoni from central France.
\par The M. arvernensis may be considered as a characteristic
\par Pliocene species in Italy, France, and Europe generally. In
\par Britain it occurs in the Norwich Crag and the Ked Crag of
\par Suffolk.
\par Species of mastodon occur in the Pliocene of La Plata, and
\par of .the temperate regions of South America ; on the Pampas,
\par and in the Andes of Chili.
\par The Mastodon mirificus of Leidy is the earliest known species
\par in America ; this occurs in Pliocene deposits on the Niobrara
\par and the Loup fork, west of the Mississippi.
\par The remains of the Mastodon americanus of Cuvier occur
\par abundantly in the Post Pliocene deposits throughout the

\par are also found in Canada and Nova Scotia.

\par height and twenty-four to twenty-five feet in length, including
\par seven feet for the tusks. Undigested food found with

\par A distinct species characterised the Quaternary deposits of

\par THE IRISH ELK. The species (Megaceros hibermcus),
\par commonly but erroneously called the Irish Elk, was, as professor
\par Owen* has pointed out, a true deer, whose place is
\par between the fallow and reindeer.
\par Though now extinct, it survived the Palaeolithic period,
\par and may possibly have existed down to historic times. Mr.
\par Gosse adduces some very strong testimony on this point, and
\par is of opinion that its extinction cannot have taken place
\par more than a thousand years ago.
\par It had a flattened and expanded form of antler, with
\par peculiarities unknown among existing deer, and was, in
\par comparison with these, of gigantic size ; the height to the
\par summit of the antlers being from ten to eleven feet in the
\par largest individuals, and the span of the antlers, in one case,
\par over twelve feet.
\par Although its remains have been found most abundantly
\par in Ireland, it was widely distributed over Britain and middle
\par Europe. It has been found in peat swamps, lacustrine
\par marls, bone caverns, fen deposits, and the Cornish gravels.
\par It has been obtained from the cavern of Goyet in Belgium,
\par and from the burial-place at Aurignac, in the department
\par of the Haute Garonne. Its known range in time is from the
\par early part of the Glacial period down to, possibly, historic
\par periods.
\par The CAVE -HYAENA Hycena spelcea of Goldfuss is, like
\par the cave-bear, characteristic of Europe during the Palaeolithic
\par age. It has been found in numerous caves in Britain, such

\par Somersetshire, explored by Dawkins in 1859 ; in all of these
\par the remains are associated with those of man, or with his
\par implements. This species is closely related to the H. crocuta
\par of Zimin, at present existing in South Africa, and is by some
\par geologists considered identical with it. It is, however, larger.
\par It appears to have to some extent replaced the cave-bear
\par in Britain ; we are also, doubtless, greatly indebted to it for
\par some of the extensive collections of bones in caverns, resulting
\par from the carcases which it had dragged thither, and
\par imperfectly destroyed.
\par In a cave at Kirkdale, in the vale of Pickering, the bones
\par of about three hundred individuals hyaenas were found
\par mingled with the remains of the mammoth, bear, rhinoceros,
\par deer, cave-lion, brown bear, horse, hare, and other species.
\par Mr. Dawkins,* in describing it, says :
\par " The pack of hyaenas
\par fell upon reindeer in the winter, and at other times on horses
\par and bisons, and were able to master the hippopotamus, the
\par lion, the slender-nosed rhinoceros, or the straight-tusked
\par elephant, and to carry their bones to their den, where they
\par were found by Dr. Buckland. The hyaenas also inhabiting
\par the ' Dukeries,' dragged back to their dens fragments of
\par lion."
\par Notable Quaternary forms (now extinct) on the American
\par continent are the gigantic sloth-like animals Megatherium,
\par which reached eighteen feet in length, and Mylodon, one
\par species of which (M. robustus) was eleven feet in length ;
\par Armadillos, such as Glyptodon, with a total length of nine
\par feet ; Chlamydotherium, as big as a rhinoceros ; and Pachytherium,
\par equalling an ox.
\par In Australia we find marsupial forms as at the present
\par day ; but they were gigantic in comparison with the latter.
\par As for example, the Diprotodon, which equalled in size a
\par hippopotamus, and the Nototkerium, as large as a bullock.

\par It must also be borne in mind that the linking together of

\par daily proceeding ; so that some even of those spoken of in
\par greater detail may shortly be generally recognised, as at
\par present they are held by a few, to be identical with existing
\par forms.
\par The HIPPOPOTAMUS. The Hippopotamus major, now considered

\par been found in river gravels at Grays, Ilford, and elsewhere,
\par in the lower part of the river-horder deposits of Amiens with
\par flint implements, and in Quaternary deposits on the continent
\par of Europe.
\par THE CAVE-LION Felis spelcea is now considered to be
\par merely a variety of the African lion (Felis led), although of
\par larger size ;
\par it had a very wide range over Britain and
\par Europe during the Post Pliocene period, as also did the
\par leopard (F. pardus) and probably the lynx (Lyncus).

\par exists, both domesticated and wild, in northern Europe and
\par America, is adapted for northern latitudes. It formerly
\par extended over Europe, and in the British Isles probably
\par survived in the north of Scotland until the twelfth century.
\par Its remains have been found in Pleistocene deposits in
\par numerous localities, but most abundantly in those which
\par M. Lartet has assigned to the period which he calls the
\par Eeindeer age.
\par Other Pleistocene mammals still existing, but whose range
\par is much restricted, are the musk ox (Ovibos moschatus),
\par familiar to us, from the accounts of arctic expeditions, as
\par occurring in the circumpolar regions of North America ; the

\par FIG. 16. RHYTINA STELLERI. (From

\par The Solitaire was confined to the island of Mascaregue or
\par Bourbon. It is fully described by Francis Leguat, who,
\par having fled from France into Holland in 1689, to escape
\par religious persecution consequent on the revocation of the
\par Edict of Nantes, engaged under the Marquis de Quesne in an
\par expedition for the purpose of settlement on that island. This
\par bird also speedily became extinct.
\par The Moa (Dinornis giganteus, Owen) reached from twelve
\par to fourteen feet in height, and survived for a long period after
\par the migration of the Maories to New Zealand. Bones of it
\par have been found along with charred wood, showing that it
\par had been killed and eaten by the natives ; and its memory
\par is preserved in many of their traditions, which also record the
\par existence of a much larger bird, a species of eagle or hawk,
\par which used to prey upon it.*
\par * The Moa was associated with other species also nearly or totally

\par of Nestor, and of Notornis. One survivor of the latter was obtained
\par by Mr. Gideon Mantell, and described by my father, Mr. John Gould,
\par in 1850. I believe the Nestor is still, rarely, met with. Mr. Mantell is
\par of opinion that the Moa and his congeners continued in existence long
\par after the advent of the aboriginal Maori. Mr. Mantell discovered a
\par gigantic fossil egg, presumably that of the Moa.

\par Eapidly approaching total extinction are the several

\par with merely rudimentary wings : as also the Notornis, a large

\par state, but of which a living specimen was secured by Mr.
\par Walter Mantell in 1849 : and the Rapapo (Strigops habroptilus)
\par of G. R. Gray a strange owl-faced nocturnal groundparrot.
\par The jEpyornis maximus was almost as large as the Moa ;
\par of this numerous fossil bones and a few eggs have been
\par discovered, but there are not, I believe, any traditions extant
\par among the natives of Madagascar of its having survived to a
\par late period.
\par The Great Auk (Alca impennis) is now believed to be

\par In conclusion, I may point out that that excellent naturalist
\par Pliny* records the disappearance, in his days, of certain species
\par formerly known. He mentions the Incendiary, the Olivia,
\par and the Subis (species of birds), and states that there were
\par many other birds mentioned in the Etruscan ritual, which
\par were no longer to be found in his time. He also says that
\par there had been a bird in Sardinia resembling the crane, and
\par called the Gromphaena, which was no longer known even by
\par the people of the country.
\par Local Extinction.
\par Of local extinction we may note in our own island the cases
\par of the beaver, the bear, the wolf, the wild cattle, the elk,
\par the wild boar, the bustard, and the capercailzie ; of these
\par the beaver survived in Wales and Scotland until the time
\par of Giraldus Cambrensis in 1188, and Pennant notes indications
\par of its former existence in the names of several streams
\par and lakes in Wales. It was not uncommon throughout the
\par greater part of Europe down to the Middle Ages.

\par The bear, still common in Norway and the Pyrenees, is

\par which are supposed to have been compiled in the seventh
\par century. They say that " the Kymri, a Celtic tribe, first
\par inhabited Britain ; before them were no men here, but only
\par bears, wolves, beavers, and oxen with high prominences."
\par Mr. Gosse adds,
\par " The Roman poets knew of its existence
\par here. Martial speaks of the robber Laureolis being exposed
\par on the cross to the fangs of the Caledonian bear ; and Claudian
\par alludes to British bears. The Emperor Claudius, on
\par his return to Rome after the conquest of this island, exhibited,
\par as trophies, combats of British bears in the Arena.
\par In the Penitential of Archbishop Egbert, said to have been

\par the English forests, and the city of Norwich is said to have
\par been required to furnish a bear annually to Edward the
\par Confessor, together with six dogs, no doubt for baiting him."
\par The wolf, though greatly reduced in numbers during the

\par The bustard, once abundant, is now extinct in Britain,
\par so far as the indigenous race is concerned. Occasionally a

\par numbers have been greatly diminished. It was common in

\par now extremely rare, and is still common in Eastern Asia.

\par In America, the process of extermination marches with

\par the absolute disappearance of the walrus from the Gulf of

\par oil, and thus lessened considerably the number of vessels
\par equipped for the whale fishery.
\par In South Africa, elephants and all other large game are
\par being steadily exterminated within the several colonies.
\par In Australia, we find that the seals which thronged the
\par islands of Bass's Straits in countless thousands, at the period
\par when Bass made his explorations there, have utterly disappeared.
\par The bulk of them were destroyed by seal-hunters
\par from Sydney within a few years after his discovery. The
\par lamentable records of the Sydney Gazette of that period show
\par this, for they detail the return to port, after a short cruise,
\par of schooners laden with from twelve to sixteen thousand
\par skins each. The result of this has been that for many years
\par past the number of seals has been limited to a few individuals,
\par to be found on one or two isolated rocks off Clarke's
\par Island, and on Hogan's group.
\par The great sea-elephant, which, in Peron's time, still
\par migrated for breeding purposes from antarctic regions to the
\par shores of King's Island, where it is described by him as
\par lining the long sandy beaches by hundreds, has been almost
\par unseen there since the date of his visit, and its memory is
\par only preserved in the names of Sea-Elephant Bay, Elephant
\par Rock, &c. which are still inscribed on our charts.
\par The introduction of the Dingo, by the Australian blacks
\par in their southward migration, is supposed to have caused the
\par extinction of the Thylacinus (T. cynocephalus), or striped
\par Australian wolf, on the main land of Australia, where it was
\par once abundant ; it is now only to be found in the remote
\par portions of the island of Tasmania. This destruction of one
\par species by another is paralleled in our own country by the
\par approaching extinction of the indigenous and now very rare
\par black rat, which has been almost entirely displaced by the
\par fierce grey rat from Norway.
\par 72 MYTHICAL MONSTERti.
\par We learn from incidental passages in the Bamboo Books*
\par that the rhinoceros, which is now unknown in China, formerly
\par extended throughout that country. We read of King Ch'aou,
\par named Hea (B.C. 980), that " in his sixteenth year [of reign]
\par the king attacked Ts'oo, and in crossing the river Han met
\par with a large rhinoceros." And, again, of King E, named
\par See (B.C. 860), that " in his sixth year, when hunting in the
\par forest of Shay, he captured a rhinoceros and carried it
\par home." There is also mention made though this is less
\par conclusive that in the time of King Yiu, named Yeu
\par (B.C. 313), the King of Yueh sent Kung-sze Yu with a
\par present of three hundred boats, five million arrows, together
\par with rhinoceros' horns and elephants' teeth.
\par Elephants are now unknown in China except in a domesticated
\par state, but they probably disputed its thick forest and
\par jungly plains with the Miaotsz, Lolos, and other tribes which
\par held the country before its present occupants. This may be
\par inferred from the incidental references to them in the Shan
\par Hai King, a work reputed to be of great antiquity, of which
\par more mention will be made hereafter, and from evidence
\par contained in other ancient Chinese works which has been
\par summarized by Mr. Kingsmillf as follows :
\par " The rhinoceros and elephant certainly lived in Honan
\par B.C. 600. The Tso-chuen, commenting on the C'hun T'siu
\par of the second year of the Duke Siuen (B.C. 605), describes
\par the former as being in sufficient abundance to supply skins
\par for armour. The want, according to the popular saying,
\par was not of rhinoceroses to supply skins, but of courage to
\par animate the wearers. From the same authority (Duke Hi
\par XIII., B.C. 636) we learn that while T'soo (Hukwang) produced
\par ivory and rhinoceros' skins in abundance, Tsin, lying

\par north of the Yellow River, on the most elevated part of the
\par Loess, was dependent on the other for its supplies of those
\par commodities. The Tribute of Yu tells the same tale. Yangchow
\par and King (Kiangpeh and Hukwang), we are told, sent
\par tribute of ivory and rhinoceros' hide, while Liang (Shensi)
\par sent the skins of foxes and bears. Going back to mythical
\par times, we find Mencius (III. ii. 9) telling how Chow Kung
\par expelled from Lu (Shantung) the elephants and rhinoceroses,
\par the tigers and leopards."
\par Mr. Kingsmill even suggests that the species referred to
\par were the mammoth and the Siberian rhinoceros (E. tichorhinus).
\par M. Chabas* publishes an Egyptian inscription showing
\par that the elephant existed in a feral state in the Euphrates
\par Valley in the time of Thothmes III. (16th century B.C.).
\par The inscription records a great hunting of elephants in the
\par neighbourhood of Nineveh.
\par Tigers still abound in Manchuria and Corea, their skins
\par forming a regular article of commerce in Vladivostock, Newchwang,
\par and Seoul. They are said to attain larger dimensions
\par in these northern latitudes than their southern congener,
\par the better-known Bengal tiger. They are generally extinct
\par in China Proper ; but Pere David states that he has seen
\par them in the neighbourhood of Pekin, in Mongolia, and at
\par Moupin, and they are reported to have been seen near Amoy.

\par " There are very

\par large enough to make an entire roof ; for a single one reaches
\par the length of fifteen cubits, so that not a few people are able

\par them have any necessity for repairing them, as in the case
\par of broken tiles, for the whole roof is made out of a solid
\par shell so that it has the appearance of a cavernous or undermined
\par rock, and of a natural roof."

\par " The external appearance of this lizard is the most ferocious
\par of any that I know.5 ' In Megalania the head was rendered
\par horrible and menacing by horns projecting from its sides,
\par and from the tip of the nose, which would be "as available
\par against the attacks of Thylacoleo as the buffalo's horns are
\par against those of the South African lion." The tail consisted
\par of a series of annular segments armed with horny

\par CHAPTER III.
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN.
\par I DO not propose to bestow any large amount of space upon
\par the enumeration of the palaeontological evidence of the
\par antiquity of man. The works of the various eminent
\par authors who have devoted themselves to the special consideration
\par of this subject exhaust all that can be said upon it
\par with our present data, and to these I must refer the reader
\par who is desirous of acquainting himself critically with its
\par details, confining myself to a few general statements based
\par on these labours.
\par In the early days of geological science when observers
\par were few, great groups of strata were arranged under an
\par artificial classification, which, while it has lost to a certain
\par extent the specific value which it then assumed to possess, is
\par still retained for purposes of convenient reference. Masters
\par of the science acquired, so to say, a possessive interest in
\par certain regions of it, and the names of Sedgwick, Murchison,
\par Jukes, Phillips, Lyell, and others became, and will remain,
\par inseparably associated with the history of those great divisions
\par of the materials of the earth's crust, which, under the
\par names of the Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,
\par and Tertiary formations, have become familiar to us.
\par In those days, when observations were limited to a comparatively
\par small area, the lines separating most of these
\par formations were supposed to be hard and definite ; forms of
\par life which characterized one, were presumed to have become
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 79
\par entirely extinct before the inauguration of those which succeeded
\par them, and breaks in the stratigraphical succession
\par appeared to justify the opinion, held by a large and influential
\par section, that great cataclysms or catastrophes had marked the
\par time when one age or formation terminated and another
\par commenced to succeed it.
\par By degrees, and with the increase of observers, both in
\par England and in every portion of the world, modifications of
\par these views obtained ; passage beds were discovered, connecting
\par by insensible gradations formations which had
\par hitherto been supposed to present the most abrupt separations;
\par transitional forms of life connecting them were
\par unearthed ; and an opinion was advanced, and steadily confirmed,
\par which at the present day it is probable no one would
\par be found to dispute, that not all in one place or country, but
\par discoverable in some part or other of the world, a perfect
\par sequence exists, from the very earliest formations of which
\par we have any cognizance, up to the alluvial and marine
\par deposits in process of formation at the present day.*
\par * " We shall, I think, eventually more fully recognise th'at, as is the
\par case with the periods of the day, each of the larger geological divisions
\par follows the other, without any actual break or boundary ; and that the
\par minor subdivisions are like the hours on the clock, useful and conventional
\par rather than absolutely fixed by any general cause in Nature."
\par Annual Address, President of G-eological Society, 1875.
\par " With regard to stratigraphical geology, the main foundations are
\par already laid, and a great part of the details filled in. The tendency of
\par modern discoveries has already been, and will probably still be, to fill
\par up those breaks, which, according to the view of many, though by no
\par means all geologists, are so frequently assumed to exist between different
\par geological periods and to bring about a more full recognition of the
\par continuity of geological time. As knowledge increases, it will, I think,
\par become more and more apparent that all existing divisions of time are
\par to a considerable extent local and arbitrary. But, even when this is
\par fully recognised, it will still be found desirable to retain them, if only
\par for the . sake of convenience and approximate precision." Annual
\par Address, President of Geological Society, 1876.
\par 80 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Correlatively it was deduced that the same phenomena of
\par nature have been in action since the earliest period when
\par organic existence can be affirmed. The gradual degradation
\par of pre-existing continents by normal destructive agencies,
\par the upheaval and subsidence of large areas, the effusion from
\par volcanic vents, into the air or sea, of ashes and lavas, the
\par action of frost and ice, of heat, rain, and sunshine all these
\par have acted in the past as they are still acting before our
\par eyes.
\par In earlier days, arguing from limited data, a progressive
\par creation was claimed which confined the appearance of the
\par higher form of vertebrate life to a successive and widelystepped
\par gradation.
\par Hugh Miller, and other able thinkers, noted with satisfaction
\par the appearance, first of fish, then of reptiles, next of
\par birds and mammals, and finally, as the crowning work of all,
\par both geologically and actually, quite recently of man.
\par This wonderful confirmation of the Biblical history of
\par creation appealed so gratefully to many, that it caused for a
\par time a disposition to cramp discovery, and even to warp the
\par facts of science, in order to make them harmonize with the
\par statements of Revelation. The alleged proofs of the existence
\par of pre-historic man were for a long time jealously disputed,
\par and it was only by slow degrees that they were admitted,
\par that the tenets of the Darwinian school gained ground, and
\par that the full meaning was appreciated of such anomalies as
\par the existence at the present day of Ganoid fishes both in
\par America and Europe, of true Palaeozoic type, or of Oolitic
\par forms on the Australian continent and in the adjacent seas.
\par But step by step marvellous palaeontological discoveries
\par were made, and the pillars which mark the advent of each
\par great form of life have had to be set back, until now no one
\par would, I think, be entirely safe in affirming that even in the
\par Cambrian, the oldest of all fossiliferous formations, vestiges
\par of mammals, that is to say, of the highest forms of life, may
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 81
\par not at a future day be found, or that the records contained
\par between the Cambrian and the present day, may not in fact
\par be but a few pages as compared with the whole volume of
\par the world's history.*
\par * " It was not until January 1832, that the second volume of the
\par Principles was published, when it was received with as much favour as
\par the first had been. It related more especially to the changes in the
\par organic world, while the former volume had treated mainly of the
\par inorganic forces of nature. Singularly enough, some of the points
\par which were seized on by his great fellow-labourer Murchison for his
\par presidential address to this Society in 1832, as subjects for felicitation,
\par are precisely those which the candid mind of Lyell, ever ready to attach
\par the full value to discoveries or arguments from time to time brought
\par forward, even when in opposition to his own views, ultimately found
\par reason to modify. We can never, I think, more highly appreciate Sir
\par Charles LyelPs freshness of mind, his candour and love of truth, than
\par when we compare certain portions of the first edition of the Principles
\par with those which occupy the same place in the last, and trace the
\par manner in which his judicial intellect was eventually led to conclusions
\par diametrically opposed to those which he originally held. To those
\par acquainted only with the latest editions of the Principles, and with his
\par Antiquity of Man, it may sound almost ironical in Murchison to have
\par written,
\par ' I cannot avoid noticing the clear and impartial manner in
\par which the untenable parts of the dogmas concerning the alteration and
\par transmutation of species and genera are refuted, and how satisfactorily
\par the author confirms the great truth of the recent appearance of man
\par upon our planet.'
\par "By the work (Principles of Geology, vol. iii.), as a whole, was dealt
\par the most telling blow that had ever fallen upon those to whom it
\par appears
\par l more philosophical to speculate on the possibilities of the past
\par than patiently to explore the realities of the present,' while the earnest
\par and careful endeavour to reconcile the former indications of change
\par with the evidence of gradual mutation now in progress, or which may
\par be in progress, received its greatest encouragement. The doctrines
\par which Hutton and Playfair had held and taught assumed new and more
\par vigorous life as better principles were explained by their eminent successor,
\par and were supported by arguments which, as a whole, were incontrovertible."
\par Annual Address, President of Geological Society, 1876.
\par "But, as Sir Roderick Murchison has long ago proved, there are
\par parts of the record which are singularly complete, and in those parts
\par we have the proof of creation without any indication of development.
\par The Silurian rocks, as regards oceanic life, are perfect and abundant in
\par 6
\par MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par It is with the later of these records that we have to deal,
\par in which discoveries have been made sufficiently progressive
\par to justify the expectation that they have by no means reached
\par their limit, and sufficiently ample in themselves to open the
\par widest fields for philosophic speculation and deduction.
\par Before stating these, it may be premised that estimates
\par have been attempted by various geologists of the collective
\par age of the different groups of formations. These are based
\par on reasonings which for the most part it is unnecessary to give
\par in detail, in so much as these can scarcely yet be considered
\par to have passed the bounds of speculation, and very different
\par results can be arrived at by theorists according to the relative
\par importance which they attach to the data employed in the
\par calculation.
\par Thus Mr. T. Mellard Keade, in a paper communicated to
\par the Royal Society in 1878, concludes that the formation of
\par the sedimentary strata must have occupied at least six hundred
\par million years : which he divides in round numbers as
\par follows :

\par as sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life

\par On the other hand, Mr. Croll considers that it is utterly

\par This, moreover, is irrespective of the vast periods during
\par which life must have existed, which on the development
\par theory necessarily preceded the Cambrian, and, according to
\par Mr. Darwin, should not be less than in the proportion of
\par five to two.
\par In fine, one school of geologists and zoologists demand
\par the maximum periods quoted above, to account for the
\par amount of sedimentary deposit, and the specific developments
\par which have occurred ; the other considers the periods claimed
\par as requisite for these actions to be unnecessary, and to be in
\par excess of the limits which, according to their views, the
\par physical elements of the case permit.
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 85
\par Mr. Wallace, in reviewing the question, dwells on the probability
\par of the rate of geological changes having been greater
\par in very remote times than it is at present, and thus opens a
\par way to the reconciliation of the opposing views so far as one
\par half the question is concerned.
\par Having thus adverted to the principles upon which various
\par theorists have in part based their attacks on the problem of
\par the estimation of the duration of geological ages, I may now
\par make a few more detailed observations upon those later
\par periods during which man is, now, generally admitted to have
\par existed, and refer lightly to the earlier times which some, but
\par not all, geologists consider to have furnished evidences of his
\par presence.
\par I omit discussing the doubtful assertions of the extreme
\par antiquity of man, which come to us from American observers,
\par such as are based on supposed footprints in rocks of secondary
\par age, figured in a semi-scientific and exceedingly valuable
\par popular journal. There are other theories which I omit,
\par both because they need further confirmation by scientific
\par investigators, and because they deal with periods so remote
\par as to be totally devoid of significance for the argument of
\par this work.
\par Nor, up to the present time, are the evidences of the
\par existence of man during Miocene and Pliocene times admitted
\par as conclusive. Professor Capellini has discovered, in deposits
\par recognised by Italian geologists as of Pliocene age, cetacean
\par bones, which are marked with incisions such as only a sharp
\par instrument could have produced, and which, in his opinion,
\par must be ascribed to human agency. To this view it is objected
\par that the incisions might have been made by the teeth
\par of fishes, and further evidence is waited for.
\par Not a few discoveries have been made, apparently extending
\par the existence of man to a much more remote antiquity,
\par that of Miocene times. M. 1'Abbe Bourgeois has collected,
\par from undoubted Miocene strata at Thenay, supposed flint
\par 86 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par implements which he conceives to exhibit evidences of having
\par been fashioned by man, as well as stones showing in some
\par cases traces of the action of fire, and which he supposes to
\par have been used as pot-boilers. M. Carlos Eibeiro has made
\par similar discoveries of worked flints and quartzites in the
\par Pliocene and Miocene of the Tagus ; worked flint has been
\par found in the Miocene of Aurillac (Auvergne) by M. Tardy,
\par and a cut rib of Halitherium fossile, a Miocene species, by
\par M. Delaunay at Pouance.
\par Very divided opinions are entertained as to the interpretation
\par of the supposed implements discovered by M. TAbbe
\par Bourgeois. M. Quatrefages, after a period of doubt, has
\par espoused the view of their being of human origin, and of
\par Miocene age.
\par " Since then," he says,
\par " fresh specimens discovered
\par have removed my last doubts. A small knife or
\par scraper, among others, which shows a fine regular finish, can,
\par in my opinion, only have been shaped by man. Nevertheless,
\par I do not blame those of my colleagues who deny or still
\par doubt. In such a matter there is no very great urgency,
\par and, doubtless, the existence of Miocene man will be proved,
\par as that of Glacial and Pliocene has been, by facts/' Mr.
\par Geikie, from whose work Prehistoric Europe I have summarized
\par the above statements, says, in reference to this
\par question :
\par " There is unquestionably much force in what
\par M. Quatrefages says ; nevertheless, most geologists will
\par agree with him that the question of man's Miocene age still
\par remains to be demonstrated by unequivocal evidence. At
\par present, all that we can safely say is, that man was probably
\par living in Europe near the close of the Pliocene period, and
\par that he was certainly an occupant of our continent during
\par glacial and interglacial times."
\par Professor Marsh considers that the evidence, as it stands
\par to-day, although not conclusive,
\par " seems to place the first
\par appearance of man [in America] in the Pliocene, and that
\par the best proofs of this are to be found on the Pacific coast."
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 87
\par He adds :
\par (t During several visits to that region many facts
\par were brought to my knowledge which render this more than
\par probable. Man, at this time, was a savage, and was doubtless
\par forced by the great volcanic outbreaks to continue his
\par migration. This was at first to the south, since mountain
\par chains were barriers on the east," and " he doubtless first
\par came across Behring's Straits."
\par I have hitherto assumed a certain acquaintance, upon the
\par part of the general reader, with the terms Eocene, Miocene,
\par and Pliocene, happily invented by Sir Charles Lyell to designate
\par three of the four great divisions of the Tertiary age.
\par These, from their universal acceptation and constant use,
\par have " become familiar in our mouths as household words."
\par But it will be well, before further elaborating points in the
\par history of these groups, bearing upon our argument, to take
\par into consideration their subdivisions, and the equivalent or
\par contemporary deposits composing them in various countries.
\par This can be most conveniently done by displaying these, in
\par descending order, in a tabular form, which I accordingly annex
\par below. This is the more desirable as there are few departments
\par in geological science which have received more attention
\par than this ; or in which greater returns, in the shape of important
\par and interesting discoveries relative to man's existence,
\par have been made.
\par Comparatively recent comparatively, that is to say, with
\par regard to the vast aeons that preceded them, but extending
\par back over enormous spaces of time when contrasted with the
\par limited duration of written history, they embrace the period
\par during which the mainly existing distribution of land and ocean
\par has obtained, and the present forms of life have appeared by
\par evolution from preceding species, or, as some few still maintain,

\par We learn, both from the nature of these deposits and from
\par their organic contents, that climatic oscillations have been
\par passing during the whole period of their deposition over the
\par surface of the globe, and inducing corresponding fluctuations
\par in the character of the vegetable and animal life abounding
\par on it. A complete collation of these varying conditions at
\par synchronous periods remains to be achieved, but the study
\par of our own country, and those adjacent to it, shows that
\par alternations of tropical, boreal, and temperate climate have
\par occurred in it ; a remarkable series of conditions which has
\par only lately been thoroughly and satisfactorily accounted for.
\par Thus, during a portion of the Eocene period a tropical
\par climate prevailed, as is evidenced by deposits containing
\par remains of palms of an equatorial type, crocodiles, turtles,
\par tropical shells, and other remains attesting the existence of
\par a high temperature. The converse is proved of the Pleistocene
\par by the existence of a boreal fauna, and the widespread
\par evidences of glacial action. The gradations of climate during
\par the Miocene and Pliocene, and the amelioration subsequent
\par to the glacial period, have resulted in the gradual development
\par or appearance of specific life as it exists at present.
\par Corresponding indications of secular variability of climate
\par are derived from all quarters : during the Miocene age,
\par Greenland (in N. Lat. 70) developed an abundance of trees,
\par such as the yew, the Redwood, a Sequoia allied to the Californian
\par species, beeches, planes, willows, oaks, poplars, and
\par walnuts, as well as a Magnolia and a Zamia. In Spitsbergen
\par (N. Lat. 78 56') flourished yews, hazels, poplars, alders,
\par beeches, and limes. At the present day, a dwarf willow and
\par a few herbaceous plants form the only vegetation, and the
\par ground is covered with almost perpetual ice and snow.
\par Many similar fluctuations of climate have been traced right
\par back through the geological record ; but this fact, though
\par interesting in relation to the general solution of the causes,
\par has little bearing on the present purpose.
\par 92 MYTHICAL MONSTEES.
\par Sir Charles Lyell conceived that all cosmical changes of
\par climate in the past might be accounted for by the varying
\par preponderance of land in the vicinity of the equator or near
\par the poles, supplemented, of course, in a subordinate degree
\par by alteration of level and the influence of ocean currents.
\par When, for example, at any geological period the excess of
\par land was equatorial, the ascent and passage northwards of
\par currents of heated air would, according to his view, render
\par the poles habitable ; while, per contra, the excessive massing
\par of land around the pole, and absence of it from the equator,
\par would cause an arctic climate to spread far over the now
\par temperate latitudes.
\par The correctness of these inferences has been objected to
\par by Mr. James Geikie and Dr. Croll, who doubt whether the
\par northward currents of air would act as successful carriers of
\par heat to the polar regions, or whether they would not rather
\par dissipate it into space upon the road. On the other hand,
\par Mr. Geikie, though admitting that the temperature of a large
\par unbroken arctic continent would be low, suggests that, as the
\par winds would be stripped of all moisture on its fringes, the
\par interior would therefore be without accumulations of snow and
\par ice; and in the more probable event of its being deeply indented
\par by fjords and bays, warm sea-currents (the representatives of
\par our present Gulf and Japan streams, but possessing a higher
\par temperature than either, from the greater extent of equatorial
\par sea-surface originating them, and exposed to the sun's influence)
\par would flow northward, and, ramifying, carry with them
\par warm and heated atmospheres far into its interior, though
\par even these, he thinks, would be insufficient in their effects
\par under any circumstances to produce the sub -tropical climates
\par which are known to have existed in high latitudes.
\par Mr. John Evans* has thrown out the idea that possibly a
\par Proceedings, Eoyal Sooi^v, vol. xv. No. 82, 1866.
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 93
\par complete translation of geographical position with respect to
\par polar axes may have been produced by a sliding of the whole
\par surface crust of the globe about a fluid nucleus. This, he
\par considers, would be induced by disturbances of equilibrium
\par of the whole mass from geological causes. He further points
\par out that the difference between the polar and equatorial diameters
\par of the globe, which constitutes an important objection
\par to his theory, is materially reduced when we take into consideration
\par the enormous depth of the ocean over a large
\par portion of the equator, and the great tracts of land elevated
\par considerably above the sea-level in higher latitudes. He also
\par speculates on the general average of the surface having in
\par bygone geological epochs approached much more nearly to
\par that of a sphere than it does at the present time.
\par Sir John Lubbock favoured the idea of a change in the
\par position of the axis of rotation, and this view has been supported
\par by Sir H. James* and many later geologists. t If I
\par apprehend their arguments correctly, this change could only
\par have been produced by what may be termed geological revolutions.
\par These are great outbursts of volcanic matter, elevations,
\par subsidences, and the like. These having probably
\par been almost continuous throughout geological time, incessant
\par changes, small or great, would be demanded in the position
\par of the axis, and the world must be considered as a globe
\par rolling over in space with every alteration of its centre of
\par gravity. The possibility of this view must be left for mathematicians
\par and astronomers to determine.
\par Sounder arguments sustain the theory propounded by Dr.
\par Croll (though this, again, is not universally accepted), that
\par all these alterations of climate can be accounted for by the
\par effects of nutation, and the precession of the equinoxes.
\par *
\par Athenceum, August 25, 1860, &c.
\par f The mass of astronomers, however, deny that this is possible to anyvery
\par great extent.
\par 94 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par From these changes, combined with the eccentricity of the
\par ecliptic from the first, it results that at intervals of ten
\par thousand five hundred years, the northern and southern
\par hemispheres are alternately in aphelion during the winter,
\par and in perihelion during the summer months, and vice versa ;
\par or, in other words, that if at any given period the inclination
\par of the earth's axis produces winter in the northern hemisphere,
\par while the earth is at a maximum distance from that
\par focus of its orbit in which the sun is situated, then, after
\par an interval of ten thousand five hundred years, and as a
\par result of the sum of the backward motion of the equinoxes
\par along the ecliptic, at the rate of 50' annually, the converse
\par will obtain, and it will be winter in the northern hemisphere
\par while the earth is at a minimum distance from the sun.
\par The amount of eccentricity of the ecliptic varies greatly
\par during long periods, and has been calculated for several
\par million years back. Mr. Croll* has demonstrated a theory
\par explaining all great secular variations of climate as indirectly
\par the result of this, through the action of sundry physical
\par agencies, such as the accumulation of snow and ice, and
\par especially the deflection of ocean currents. From a consideration
\par of the tables which he has computed of the eccentricity
\par and longitude of the earth's orbit, he refers the glacial
\par epoch to a period commencing about two hundred and forty
\par thousand years back, and extending down to about eighty
\par thousand years ago, and he describes it as "
\par consisting of
\par a long succession of cold and warm periods ; the warm
\par periods of the one hemisphere corresponding in time with
\par the cold periods of the other, and vice versa."
\par Having thus spoken of the processes adopted for estimating
\par the duration of geological ages, and the results which have
\par been arrived at, with great probability of accuracy, in regard

\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 95
\par to some of the more recent, it now only remains to briefly
\par state the facts from which the existence of man, during these
\par latter periods, has been demonstrated. The literature of
\par this subject already extends to volumes, and it is therefore
\par obviously impossible, in the course of the few pages which
\par the limits of this work admit, to give anything but the
\par shortest abstract, or to assign the credit relatively due to the
\par numerous progressive workers in this rich field of research.
\par I therefore content myself with taking as my text-book Mr.
\par James Geikie's Prehistoric Europe, the latest and most exhaustive
\par work upon the subject, and summarizing from it
\par the statements essential to my purpose.
\par From it we learn that, long prior to the ages when men
\par were acquainted with the uses of bronze and iron, there
\par existed nations or tribes, ignorant of the means by which
\par these metals are utilized, whose weapons and implements
\par were formed of stone, horn, bone, and wood.
\par These, again, may be divided into an earlier and a later
\par race, strongly characterized by the marked differences in the
\par nature of the stone implements which they respectively
\par manufactured, both in respect to the material employed and
\par the amount of finish bestowed upon it. To the two periods
\par in which these people lived the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic
\par have been respectively applied, and a vast era is supposed
\par to have intervened between the retiring from Europe
\par of the one and the appearance there of the other.
\par Palaeolithic man was contemporaneous with the mammoth
\par (Elephas primigenius), the woolly rhinoceros (Rhinoceros primigenius),
\par the Hippopotamus major, and a variety of other species,
\par now quite extinct, as well as with many which, though still
\par existing in other regions, are no longer found in Europe ;
\par whereas the animals contemporaneous with Neolithic man
\par were essentially the same as those still occupying it.
\par The stone implements of Palaeolithic man had but little
\par variety of form, were very rudely fashioned, being merely
\par MYTHICAL MONSTERS.

\par chipped into shape, and never ground or polished ; they were
\par worked nearly entirely out of flint and chert. Those of
\par Neolithic man were made of many varieties of hard stone,
\par often beautifully finished, frequently ground to a sharp point
\par or edge, and polished all over.
\par Palaeolithic men were unacquainted with pottery and the
\par art of weaving, and apparently had no domesticated animals
\par or system of cultivation ; but the Neolithic lake dwellers of
\par Switzerland had looms, pottery, cereals, and domesticated
\par animals, such as swine, sheep, horses, dogs, &c.
\par Implements of horn, bone, and wood were in common use
\par among both races, but those of the older are frequently distinguished
\par by their being sculptured with great ability or
\par ornamented with life-like engravings of the various animals
\par living at the period ; whereas there appears to have been a
\par marked absence of any similar artistic ability on the part of
\par Neolithic man.
\par FIG. 20. REINDEER ENGRAVED ON ANTLER BY PALAEOLITHIC MAN
\par (After Geikie.\}
\par Again, it is noticeable that, while the passage from the
\par Neolithic age into the succeeding bronze age was gradual,
\par and, indeed, that the use of stone implements and, in some
\par 7
\par 98 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par parts, weapons, was contemporaneous with that of bronze in
\par other places, no evidence exists of a transition from Palaeolithic
\par into Neolithic times. On the contrary, the examination
\par of bone deposits, such as those of Kent's Cave and Victoria
\par Cave in England, and numerous others in Belgium and
\par France, attest "
\par beyond doubt that a considerable period
\par must have supervened after the departure of Palaeolithic man
\par and before the arrival of his Neolithic successor." The
\par discovery of remains of Palaeolithic man and animals in river
\par deposits in England and on the Continent, often at considerable
\par elevations* above the existing valley bottoms, and in
\par Loss, and the identification of the Pleistocene or Quaternary
\par period with Preglacial and Glacial times, offer a means of
\par estimating what that lapse of time must have been.f
\par * In some cases as much as 150 feet.
\par t
\par "
\par Starting from the opinion generally accepted among geologists,
\par that man was on the earth at the close of the Glacial epoch, Professor
\par B. F. Mudge adduces evidence to prove that the antiquity of man cannot
\par be less than 200,000 years.
\par " His argument, as given in the Kansas City Review of Science, is
\par about as follows :
\par "After the Glacial epoch, geologists fix three distinct epochs, the
\par Champlain, the Terrace, and the Delta, all supposed to be of nearly
\par equal lengths.
\par " Now we have in the delta of the Mississippi a means of measuring
\par the duration of the third of these epochs.
\par " For a distance of about two hundred miles of this delta are seen
\par forest growths of large trees, one after the other, with interspaces of
\par sand. There are ten of these distinct forest growths, which have begun
\par and ended one after the other. The trees are the bald cypress (Taxodium)
\par of the Southern States, and some of them were over twenty-five
\par feet in diameter. One contained over five thousand seven hundred annual
\par rings. In some instances these huge trees have grown over the stumps
\par of others equally large, and such instances occur in all, or nearly all, of
\par the ten forest beds. This gives to each forest a period of 10,000 years.
\par " Ten such periods give 100,000 years, to say nothing of the time
\par covered by the interval between the ending of one forest and the beginning
\par of another, an interval which in most cases was considerable.
\par " ' Such evidence,' writes Professor Mudge, ' would be received in any
\par ANTIQUITY OF MAN. 99
\par Skeletons or portions of the skeletons of human beings,
\par of admitted Palaeolithic age, have been found in caverns in
\par the vicinity of Liege in Belgium, by Schmerling, and probably
\par the same date may be assigned those from the Neanderthal
\par Cave near Diisseldorf. A complete skeleton, of tall
\par stature, of probable but not unquestioned Palaeolithic age,
\par has also been discovered in the Cave of Mentone on the
\par Kiviera.
\par These positive remains yield us further inferences than
\par can be drawn from the mere discovery of implements or
\par fragmentary bones associated with remains of extinct
\par animals.
\par The Mentone man, according to M. Kiviere, had a rather
\par long but large head, a high and well-made forehead, and
\par the very large facial angle of 85. In the Liege man the
\par cranium was high and short, and of good Caucasian type ;
\par " a fair average human skull," according to Huxley.
\par Other remains, such as the jaw-bone from the cave of the
\par Naulette in Belgium, and the Neanderthal skeleton, show
\par marks of inferiority ; but even in the latter, which was the
\par lowest in grade, the cranial capacity is seventy-five cubic
\par inches or "
\par nearly on a level with the mean between the two
\par human extremes."
\par We may, therefore, sum up by saying that evidences have
\par been accumulated of the existence of man, and intelligent
\par man, from a period which even the most conservative among

\par CHAPTER IV.
\par THE DELUGE NOT A MYTH.
\par IF we assume that the antiquity of man is as great, or even
\par approximately as great, as Sir Charles Lyell and his followers
\par affirm, the question naturally arises, what has he been doing
\par during those countless ages, prior to historic times ? what
\par evidences has he afforded of the possession of an intelligence
\par superior to that of the brute creation by which he has been
\par surrounded ? what great monuments of his fancy and skill
\par remain ? or has the sea of time engulphed any that he
\par erected, in abysses so deep that not even the bleached masts
\par project from the surface, to testify to the existence of the
\par good craft buried below ?
\par These questions have been only partially asked, and but
\par slightly answered. They will, however, assume greater proportions
\par as the science of archaeology extends itself, and
\par perhaps receive more definite replies when fresh fields for
\par investigation are thrown open in those portions of the old
\par world which Asiatic reserve has hitherto maintained inviolable
\par against scientific prospectors.
\par If man has existed for fifty thousand years, as some
\par demand, or for two hundred thousand, as others imagine,
\par has his intelligence gone on increasing thoughout the period ?
\par and if so, in what ratio ? Are the terms of the series which
\par involve the unknown quantity stated with sufficient precision
\par to enable us to determine whether his development has been
\par slow, gradual, and more or less uniform, as in arithmetical,
\par or gaining at a rapidly increasing rate, as in geometric progression.
\par Or, to pursue the simile, could it be more
\par 102 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par accurately expressed by the equation to a curve which traces
\par an ascending and descending path, and, though controlled in
\par reality by an absolute law, appears to exhibit an unaccountable
\par and capricious variety of positive and negative phases,
\par of points d'arret, nodes, and cusps.
\par These questions cannot yet be definitely answered ; they
\par may be proposed and argued on, but for a time the result
\par will doubtless be a variety of opinions, without the possibility
\par of solution by a competent arbiter.
\par For example, it is a matter of opinion whether the intelligence
\par of the present day is or is not of a higher order than
\par that which animated the savans of ancient Greece. It is
\par probable that most would answer in the affirmative, so far as
\par the question pertains to the culture of the masses only, but
\par how will scholars decide, who are competent to compare the
\par works of our present poets, sculptors, dramatists, logicians,
\par philosophers, historians, and statesmen, with those of Homer,
\par Pindar, QBschylus, Euripides, Herodotus, Aristotle, Euclid,
\par Phidias, Plato, Solon, and the like ? Will they, in a word,
\par consider the champions of intellect of the present day so
\par much more robust than their competitors of three thousand
\par years ago as to render them easy victors ? This would
\par demonstrate a decided advance in human intelligence during
\par that period ; but, if this is the case, how is it that all the
\par great schools and universities still cling to the reverential
\par study of the old masters, and have, until quite recently,
\par almost ignored modern arts, sciences, and languages.
\par We must remember that the ravages of time have put out
\par of court many of the witnesses for the one party to the suit,
\par and that natural decay, calamity, and wanton destruction*
\par * Such as the destruction of the Alexandrine Library on three distinct
\par occasions, (1) upon the conquest of Alexandria by Julius Caesar, B.C. 48 ;
\par (2) in A.D. 390 ; and, (3) by Amrou, the general of the Caliph Omar, in
\par 640, who ordered it to be burnt, and so supplied the baths with fuel for
\par THE DELUGE NOT A MYTH. 103
\par have obliterated the bulk of the philosophy of past ages.
\par With the exceptions of the application of steam, the employment
\par of moveable type in printing,* and the utilization of
\par electricity, there are few arts and inventions which have not
\par descended to us from remote antiquity, lost, many of them,
\par for a time, some of them for ages, and then re-discovered
\par and paraded as being, really and truly, something new under
\par the sun.
\par Neither must we forget the oratory and poetry, the masterpieces
\par of logical argument, the unequalled sculptures, and
\par the exquisitely proportioned architecture of Greece, or the
\par thorough acquaintance with mechanical principles and engineering
\par skill evinced by the Egyptians, in the construction

\par those who fringe the civilization of the present period.
\par Intellectually measured, the civilized men of eight or ten
\par thousand years ago must, I think, have been but little
\par inferior to ourselves, and we should have to peer very far
\par back indeed before we reached a status or condition in which
\par the highest type of humanity was the congener of the cave
\par lion, disputing with him a miserable existence, shielded only
\par from the elements by an overhanging rock, or the fortuitous
\par discovery of some convenient cavern.
\par If this be so, we are forced back again to the consideration
\par of the questions with which this section opened ; where are
\par the evidences of man's early intellectual superiority ? are they
\par limited to those deduced from the discovery of certain stone
\par implements of the early rude, and later polished ages ? and,
\par if so, can we offer any feasible explanation either of their
\par non-existence or disappearance ?
\par In the first place, it may be considered as admitted by
\par archaeologists that no exact line can be drawn between the
\par later of the two stone-weapon epochs, the polished Neolithic
\par stone epoch, and the succeeding age of bronze. They are
\par agreed that these overlap each other, and that the rude
\par hunters, who contented themselves with stone implements of
\par war and the chase, were coeval with people existing in other
\par places, acquainted with the metallurgical art, and therefore
\par of a high order of intelligence. The former are, in fact,
\par brought within the limit of historic times.
\par A similar inference might not unfairly be drawn with
\par regard to those numerous discoveries of proofs of the existence
\par of ruder man, at still earlier periods. The flint-headed
\par arrow of the North American Indian, and the stone hatchet
\par of the Australian black-fellow exist to the present day ; and

\par to impart the idea lucidly to others, I annex a wood-cut of a
\par chart drawn by them, impromptu, at the request of Sir J.
\par Koss, who, inferentially, vouches for its accuracy.
\par There is but a little step between carving the figure of a

\par them, and you have the early hieroglyphic written language
\par of the Chinese and Egyptians. It is not an unfair presumption
\par that at no great distance, in time or space, either some
\par generations later among his own descendants, or so many
\par nations' distance among his coevals, the initiative faculty of
\par the Palaeolithic savage was usefully applied to the communication
\par of ideas, just as at a much later date the Kououen
\par symbolic language was developed or made use of among the
\par early Chinese.*
\par Such is, necessarily, the first stage of any written language,
\par and it may, as I think, perhaps have occurred, been
\par developed into higher stages, culminated, and perished at many
\par successive epochs during man's existence, presuming it to have
\par been so extended as the progress of geology tends to affirm.
\par May not the meandering of the tide of civilization westward
\par during the last three thousand years, bearing on its
\par crest fortune and empire, and leaving in its hollow decay and
\par oblivion, possibly be the sequel of many successive waves
\par which have preceded it in the past, rising, some higher, some

\par upon the subject, have tapped the same sources of information,
\par consulted the same authorities, ranged their information
\par in almost identical order, argued from the same data, and
\par arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions.
\par Mr. Cheyne, following the lead of Continental mythologists,
\par deduces that the Deluge stories were on the whole propagated
\par from several independent centres, and adopts the theory of
\par Schirrer and Gerland that they are ether myths, without any
\par historical foundation, which have been transferred from the
\par sky to the earth.
\par M. Lenormant, upon the other hand, eliminating from the
\par inquiry the great inundation of China in the reign of Yao,
\par and some others, as purely local events, concludes as the
\par result of his researches that the story of the Deluge ' ' is a
\par universal tradition among all branches of the human race/'
\par with the one exception of the black. He further argues :
\par " Now a recollection thus precise and concordant cannot be
\par a myth voluntarily invented. No religious or cosmogenic
\par myth presents this character of universality. It must arise
\par from the reminiscences of a real and terrible event, so powerfully
\par impressing the imagination of the first ancestors of our
\par race, as never to have been forgotten by their descendants.
\par This cataclysm must have occurred near the first cradle of
\par mankind and before the dispersion of families from which the
\par different races of men were to spring."
\par Lord Arundel of Wardour adopts a similar view in many
\par respects to that of M. Lenormant, but argues for the existence
\par of a Deluge tradition in Egypt, and the identity of the
\par Deluge of Yu (in China) with the general catastrophe of
\par which the tradition is current in other countries.
\par The subject is in itself so inviting, and has so direct a
\par bearing upon the argument of this work that I propose to
\par re-examine the same materials and endeavour to show from
\par them that the possible solutions of the question have not
\par yet been exhausted.

\par 2. That of Josephus.
\par 3. The Babylonian.

\par 5. The Chinese.
\par 6. The traditions of all nations in the northern
\par hemisphere, and of certain in the southern.
\par It is unnecessary to travel in detail over the well-worn
\par ground of the myths and traditions prevalent among European
\par nations, the presumed identity of Noah with Saturn,
\par Janus, and the like, or the Grecian stories of Ogyges and
\par Deucalion. Nor is anyone, I think, disposed to dispute the
\par identity of the cause originating the Deluge legends in Persia
\par and in India. How far these may have descended from
\par independent sources it is now difficult to determine, though
\par it is more than probable that their vitality is due to the
\par written Semitic records. Nor is it necessary to discuss any
\par unimportant differences which may exist between the text of
\par Josephus and that of the Bible, which agree sufficiently
\par closely, but are mere abstracts (with the omission of many
\par important details) in comparison with the Chaldsean account.
\par This may be accounted for by their having been only derived
\par from oral tradition through the hands of Abraham. The
\par Biblical narrative shows us that Abraham left Chaldsea on a
\par nomadic enterprise, just as a squatter leaves the settled districts
\par of Australia or America at the present day, and strikes
\par out with a small following and scanty herd to search for,
\par discover, and occupy new country ; his destiny leading him,
\par may be for a few hundred, may be for a thousand miles.
\par In such a train there is no room for heavy baggage, and the
\par stone tablets containing the detailed history of the Deluge
\par would equally with all the rest of such heavy literature be
\par left behind.
\par 118 MYTHICAL MONSTEKS.
\par The tradition, however reverenced and faithfully preserved
\par at first, would, under such circumstances, soon get mutilated
\par and dwarfed. We may, therefore, pass at once to the much
\par more detailed accounts presented in the text of Berosus,
\par and in the more ancient Chaldaean tablets deciphered by
\par the late Mr. G. Smith from the collation of three separate
\par copies.
\par The account by Berosus (see Appendix) was taken from
\par the sacred books of Babylon, and is, therefore, of less value
\par than the last-mentioned as being second-hand. The leading
\par incidents in his narrative are similar to those contained in
\par that of Genesis, but it terminates with the vanishing of
\par Xisuthros (Noah) with his wife, daughter, and the pilot,
\par after they had descended from the vessel and sacrificed to
\par the gods, and with the return of his followers to Babylon.
\par They restored it, and disinterred the writings left (by the
\par pious obedience of Xisuthros) in Shurippak, the city of the
\par Sun.
\par The great majority of mythologists appear to agree in
\par assigning a much earlier date to the Deluge, than that which
\par has hitherto been generally accepted as the soundest interpretation
\par of the chronological evidence afforded by the Bible.
\par I have never had the advantage of finding the arguments
\par on which this opinion is based, formulated in association,
\par although, as incidentally referred to by various authors, they
\par appear to be mainly deduced from the references made, both
\par by sacred and profane writers, to large populations and
\par important cities existing subsequently to the Deluge, but
\par at so early a date, as to imply the necessity of a very long
\par interval indeed between the general annihilation caused by
\par the catastrophe, and the attainment of so high a pitch of
\par civilization and so numerous a population as their existence
\par implies.
\par Philologists at the same time declare that a similar inference
\par may be drawn from the vast periods requisite for the diverTHE

\par gence of different languages from the parent stock,* while the
\par testimony of the monuments and sculptures of ancient Egypt
\par assures us that race distinction of as marked a type as occurs
\par at the present day existed at so early a datef as to preclude
\par the possibility of the derivation of present nations from the
\par descendants of Noah within the limited period usually
\par allowed.
\par These difficulties vanish, if we consider the Biblical and
\par Chaldean narratives as records of a local catastrophe, of vast
\par extent perhaps, and resulting in general but not total destruction,
\par whose sphere may have embraced the greater portion
\par of Western Asia, and perhaps Europe ; but which, while
\par wrecking the great centres of northern civilization, did not
\par extend southwards to Africa and Egypt4 The Deluge legends
\par indigenous in Mexico at the date of the Spanish conquest,
\par combining the Biblical incidents of the despatch of birds
\par from a vessel with the conception of four consecutive ages
\par terminating in general destruction, and corresponding with
\par the four ages or Yugas of India, supply in themselves the
\par testimony of their probable origin from Asia. The cataclysm
\par which caused what is called the Deluge may or may not
\par have extended to America, probably not. In a future page

\par and original texts of Egypt, with their many cosmogenic speculations,
\par have not afforded one, even distant, allusion to this cataclysm.
\par When the Greeks told the Egyptian priests of the Deluge of Deucalion,
\par their reply was that they had been preserved from, it as well as from the
\par conflagration produced by Phaeton ; they even added that the Hellenes
\par were childish in attaching so much importance to that event, as there

\par I transcribe from M. Lenormant the text of the Chaldean
\par narrative, because there are points in it which have not yet
\par been commented on, and which, as it appears to me, assist
\par in the solution of the Deluge story :
\par I will reveal to thee, O Izdhubar, the history of my preservation
\par and tell to thee the decision of the gods.

\par " Man of Shurippak, son of Ubaratutu thou, build a vessel
\par and finish it [quickly]. By a [deluge] I will destroy substance and

\par life. The vessel thou shalt build 600 cubits shall be the measure of
\par its length and 60 cubits the amount of its breadth and of its height.

\par and I said to J&a, my lord :
\par "
\par [The vessel] that thou commaudest me
\par to build thus, [when] I shall do it young and old [shall laugh at
\par me]." [Ba opened his mouth and] spoke. He said to me, his servant :

\par The gods on their seats were seated in tears, and they held their lips
\par closed, [revolving] future things.
\par Six days and as many nights passed ; the wind, the waterspout, and
\par the diluvian rain were in all their strength. At the approach of the
\par seventh day the diluvian rain grew weaker, the terrible waterspout
\par which had assailed after the fashion of an earthquake grew calm, the
\par sea inclined to dry up, and the wind and the waterspout came to an end.

\par fourth day the mountain of Nizir arrested the vessel, and did not permit
\par it to pass over ; the fifth and sixth day the mountain of Nizir arrested
\par the vessel, and did not permit it to pass over. At the approach of the
\par seventh day, I sent out and loosed a dove. The dove went, turned, and
\par found no place to light on, and it came back. I sent out and loosed
\par a swallow ; the swallow went, turned, and found no place to light on,
\par and it came back. I sent out and loosed a raven ; the raven went, and
\par saw the corpses on the waters ; it ate, rested, turned, and came not back.
\par I then sent out (what was in the vessel) towards the four winds, and
\par I offered a sacrifice. I raised the pile of my burnt-offering on the peak
\par of the mountain ; seven by seven I disposed the measured vases,* and
\par beneath I spread rushes, cedar, and juniper wood. The gods were seized
\par with the desire of it, the gods were seized with a benevolent desire of
\par it ; and the gods assembled like flies above the master of the sacrifice.
\par From afar, in approaching, the great goddess raised the great zones that
\par Anu has made for their glory (the gods'). f These gods, luminous
\par crystal before me, I will never leave them ; in that day I prayed that I
\par might never leave them. " Let the gods come to my sacrificial pile !
\par but never may Bel come to my sacrificial pile ! for he did not master
\par himself, and he has made the waterspout for the Deluge, and he has
\par numbered my men for the pit."
\par From far, in drawing near, Bel saw the vessel, and Bel stopped ;
\par he was filled with anger against the gods and the celestial archangels :
\par " No one shall come out alive ! No man shall be preserved from the
\par abyss !
\par " Adar opened his mouth and said ; he said to the warrior
\par Bel :
\par " What other than a should have formed this resolution ? for
\par Ea possesses knowledge and [he foresees] all." Ea opened his mouth
\par and spake ; he said to the warrior Bel :
\par "
\par thou, herald of the gods,
\par warrior, as thou didst not master thyself, thou hast made the waterspout
\par of the deluge. Let the sinner carry the weight of his sins, the
\par blasphemer the weight of his blasphemy. Please thyself with this
\par good pleasure, and it shall never be infringed ; faith in it never [shall
\par be violated]. Instead of thy making a new deluge, let hyaenas appear
\par and reduce the number of men ; instead of thy making a new deluge,
\par let there be famine, and let the earth be [devastated] ; -instead of thy
\par making a new deluge, let DibbaraJ appear, and let men be [mown
\par down]. 1 have not revealed the decision of the great gods ; it is
\par Khasisatra who interpreted a dream and comprehended what the gods
\par had decided."
\par Then, when his resolve was arrested, Bel entered into the vessel. He

\par took my hand and made me rise. He made my wife rise, and made her
\par place herself at my side. He turned around us and stopped short ; he
\par approached our group.
\par " Until now Khasisatra has made part of
\par perishable humanity ; but lo, now, Khasisatra and his wife are going
\par to be carried away to live like the gods, and Khasisatra will reside
\par afar at the mouth of the rivers." They carried me away and established
\par me in a remote place at the mouth of the streams.
\par This narrative agrees with the Biblical one in ascribing
\par the inundation to a deluge of rain ; but adds further details
\par which connect it with intense atmospheric disturbance, similar
\par to that which would be produced by a series of cyclones, or
\par typhoons, of unusual seventy and duration.
\par The intense gloom, the deluge of rain, terrific violence of
\par wind, and the havoc both on sea and land, which accompany
\par the normal cyclones occurring annually on the eastern coast
\par of China, and elsewhere, and lasting but a few hours in any
\par one locality, can hardly be credited, except by those who
\par have experienced them. They are, however, sufficient to
\par render explicable the general devastation and loss of life
\par which would result from the duration of typhoons, or analogous
\par tempests, of abnormal intensity, for even the limited
\par period of six days and nights allotted in the text above, and
\par much more so for that of one hundred and fifty days assigned
\par to it in the Biblical account.
\par As illustrating this I may refer to a few calamities of recent
\par date, which, though of trivial importance in comparison with
\par the stupendous event under our consideration, bring home to
\par us the terribly devastating power latent in the elements.
\par In Bengal, a cyclone on October 31, 1876, laid under
\par water three thousand and ninety-three square miles, and
\par destroyed two hundred and fifteen thousand lives.
\par A typhoon which raged in Canton, Hongkong, and Macao
\par on September 22, 1874, besides much other destruction,
\par destroyed several thousand people in Macao and the adjacent
\par villages, the number of corpses in the town being so numerous
\par that they had to be gathered in heaps and burnt with kerosene,
\par THE DELUGE NOT A MYTH. 125
\par the population, without the Chinese who refused to lend
\par assistance, being insufficient to bury them.
\par A tornado in Canton, on April 11, 1878, destroyed, in the
\par course of a few minutes, two thousand houses and ten thousand
\par lives.
\par In view of these few historical facts, which might be
\par greatly supplemented, there appears to my mind to be no
\par difficulty in believing that the continuance, during even only
\par six days and six nights, of extraordinarily violent circular
\par storms over a given area, would, especially if accompanied by
\par so-called tidal or earthquake waves, be sufficient to wreck all
\par sea-going and coasting craft, all river boats, inundate every
\par country embraced within it to a very great extent, submerge
\par each metropolis, city, or village, situate either in the deltas
\par of rivers, or higher up their course, sap, unroof, batter down,
\par and destroy all dwellings on the highlands, level forests,
\par destroy all domestic animals, sweep away all cultivated soil,
\par or bury it beneath an enormous thickness of debris, tear away
\par the soil from the declivities of hills and mountains, destroy
\par all shelter, and hence, by exposure, most of those wretched
\par human beings who might have escaped drowning on the
\par lower levels. The few survivors would with difficulty escape
\par starvation, or death from subsequent exposure to the deadly
\par malaria which would be liberated by the rooting up of the
\par accumulated debris of centuries. This latter supposition
\par appears to me to be directly indicated by the passage towards
\par the end of the extract referring to famine, and to the devastation
\par of the earth by Dibbara (the god of epidemics).
\par It is noticeable that in this account there is no suggestion
\par of complete immersion, Khasisatra simply says there is not
\par any continent (i.e. all the hill ranges within sight would
\par stand out from the inundation like islands), while he speaks
\par of his vessel being arrested by the mountain of Nizir, which
\par must consequently have been above the surface of the water.
\par Neither is there any such close limitation of the number
\par 126 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par of persons preserved, as in the Biblical story, for Khasisatra
\par took with him his men-servants, maid-servants, and his
\par young people, while the version transmitted by Berosus (see
\par Appendix to this Chapter), states that Xisuthros embarked
\par his wife, children, and his intimate friends, and that these
\par latter subsequently founded numerous cities, built temples,
\par and restored Babylon.
\par We have thus a fair nucleus for starting a fresh population
\par in the Euphrates valley, which may have received accessions
\par from the gradual concentration of scattered survivors, and
\par from the enterprise of maritime adventurers from the African
\par coast and elsewhere, possibly also nomads from the north,
\par east, and west may have swelled the numbers, and a polyglot
\par community have been established, which subsequently, through
\par race distinctions, jealousies, and incompatibility of language,
\par became again dismembered, as recorded in the history of the
\par attempted erection of the Tower of Babel.
\par Confining our attention for the moment to this one locality,
\par we may imagine that the young population would not be
\par deterred by any apprehension of physical danger from reinhabiting
\par such of the old cities as remained recognizable ;
\par since we see that men do not hesitate to recommence the
\par building of cities overthrown by earthquake shocks almost
\par before the last tremblings are over ; or, as in the case of
\par Herculaneum and Pompeii, within the range of volcanoes
\par which may have already repeatedly vomited destroying floods
\par of lava. Yet, in this instance, they would probably invest
\par the calamity with a supernatural horror, and regard it, as the
\par text expresses it, as a chastisement from the gods for their
\par impiety. If this were so, the very memory of such cities
\par would soon be lost, and with it all the treasures of art and
\par literature which they contained.*
\par * It is probably as much from a superstitious sentiment as upon
\par merely physical grounds that many of the deserted cities in Asia have
\par THE DELUGE NOT A MYTH. 127
\par The Hindu account is taken from the S'atapatha-Brdhmana,
\par a work of considerable antiquity, being one of a series which
\par Professor Max Miiller believes to have been written eight
\par hundred years before Christ. A literal translation of the
\par legend, as given in this venerable work, is as follows :
\par " To Manu in the morning they brought water for washing,
\par just as they bring it for washing the hands. As he was
\par using the water, a fish came into his hand. This (fish) said
\par to him, ' Preserve me, and I will save thee. J (Manu said),
\par 1 From what wilt thou preserve me ?
\par '
\par (The fish replied),
\par 1 A flood will carry away all these creatures ; from that I will
\par preserve thee.' (Manu said),
\par ' How is thy preservation (to
\par be effected) ?
\par '
\par (The fish replied),
\par f As long as we are small,
\par there is great danger of our destruction ; fish even devours
\par fish : at first preserve me in a jar. When I grow too big for
\par that, cut a trench, and preserve me in that. When I outgrow
\par that, carry me to the sea ; then I shall be beyond (the
\par reach of) danger.' Soon it became a great fish ; it increased
\par greatly. (The fish said),
\par ' In so many years the flood will
\par come ; make a ship and worship me. On the rising of the
\par flood enter the ship, then I will preserve thee.' Having
\par preserved the fish he brought it to the sea. In the same
\par year indicated by the fish (Manu) made a ship and worshipped
\par the fish. When the flood rose he entered the ship ;
\par the fish swam near him : he attached the cable of the ship
\par to his (the fish's) horn. By this means the fish carried him
\par over the northern mountain (Himalayas). (The fish said),
\par been abandoned ; while, as a noticeable instance, we may quote Gour,
\par the ruined capital of Bengal, which is computed to have extended from
\par fifteen to twenty miles along the bank of the river, and three in depth.
\par The native tradition is that it was struck by the wrath of the gods in
\par the form of an epidemic which slew the whole population. Another
\par case is the reputed presence of a ruined city, in the vicinity of the
\par populous city of Nanking, and at some distance from the right bank of
\par the river Yangtsze, of which the walls only remain, and of the history
\par of which those in the vicinity profess to have lost all record.
\par 128 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par 1 1 have preserved thee : fasten the ship to a tree. But lest
\par the water cut thee off whilst thou art on the mountain, as
\par fast as the water subsides thou wilt descend with it,' Accordingly
\par he descended (with the water) ; hence this became
\par * Manu's Descent ' from the northern mountain. The flood
\par had carried away all those creatures, Manu alone was left.
\par He being desirous of offspring performed a sacred rite ; there
\par also he offered a p&fca-sacrifice. With clarified butter,
\par coagulated milk, whey, and curds, he made an offering to
\par the waters. In a year a female was produced ; and she arose
\par unctuous from the moisture, with clarified butter under her
\par feet. Mitra and Varuna came to her; and said to her,
\par 4 Who art thou?' (She said),
\par ' The daughter of Manu.'
\par (They said),
\par ' Say (thou art) our (daughter).'
\par ' No,' she
\par replied,
\par ' I am verily (the daughter) of him who begot me/
\par They desired a share in her ; she agreed and did not agree.
\par She went on and came to Manu. Manu said to her,
\par ' Who
\par art thou ?
\par ' * Thy daughter,' she replied.
\par * How, revered
\par one, art thou my daughter ?
\par '
\par (She replied),
\par * The offerings
\par which thou hast cast upon the waters, clarified butter, coagulated
\par milk, whey, and curds, from them thou hast generated
\par me. I am a blessing. Do thou introduce me into the sacrifice.
\par If thou wilt introduce me into the sacrifice, thou wilt be
\par (blessed) with abundance of offspring and cattle. Whatever
\par blessing thou shalt ask through me, will all be given to
\par thee.' Thus he introduced her in the middle of the sacrifice
\par ; for the middle of the sacrifice is that which comes
\par between the final and the introductory prayers. He, desirous
\par of offspring, meditating and toiling, went with her. By her
\par he begot this (offspring), which is (called)
\par ' The offspring of
\par Manu.' "
\par The correspondence of this legend with the Biblical and
\par the other accounts is remarkable. We have the announcement
\par of the Deluge, the construction of a ship, the preservation
\par therein of a representative man, the settlement of
\par THE DELUGE NOT A MYTH. 129
\par the vessel on a mountain, the gradual subsidence of the
\par water, and the subsequent re-peopling of the world by the
\par man thus preserved. The very scene of the cataclysm is in
\par singular agreement with the other accounts ; for the flood is
\par said to carry Manu " over the northern mountain." This
\par places the scene of the Deluge in Central Asia, beyond the
\par Himalaya mountains, and it proves that the legend embodies
\par a genuine tradition brought by the progenitors of the Hindus
\par from their primaeval home, whence also radiated the Semitic
\par and Sinitic branches of mankind.
\par There has been much discussion as to whether the great
\par inundation which occurred in China during the reign of Yao
\par is identical with that of Genesis or not. The close proximity
\par of date lends a strong support to the assumption, and the
\par supposition that the scene of the Biblical Deluge was local in
\par its origin, but possibly widespread in its results, further
\par favours the view.
\par As the rise of the Nile at Cairo is the only intimation
\par which the inhabitants of Lower Egypt have of the tropical
\par rains of Central Africa, so the inundation of the countries
\par adjacent to the head waters of the great rivers of China may
\par alone have informed the inhabitants of that country of serious
\par elemental disturbances, only reaching, and in a modified
\par form, their western frontier ; and it may well have been that
\par the deluge which caused a national annihilation in Western
\par Asia was only a national calamity in the eastern portion
\par of it.
\par This view is strengthened if we consider that Chinese history
\par has no record of any deluge prior to this, which could
\par hardly have been the case had the Chinese migrated from
\par their parent stock subsequent to an event of such importance ;
\par assuming that it had occurred, as there seems valid reason to
\par suppose, within the limits of written history. The anachronism
\par between the two dates assigned by Chinese authors (2297 B.C.)
\par 9
\par 130 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par and the Jewish historian's calculation (2104 B.C.) is only one
\par hundred and ninety-three years, and this is not so great but
\par that we may anticipate its being explained at some future
\par date. Strauchius' computation of 2293 B.C. for the date of
\par the Biblical deluge is within four years, and Ussher's (2349-
\par 2348) within fifty-one of the Chinese one. The reason for
\par supposing the deluge of Yao to be historically true, will be
\par inferred from the arguments borrowed from Mr. Legge on
\par the subject of the Shu-king, in another portion of this
\par volume. It is detailed in the great Chinese work on history,
\par the T'ung-keen-kang-muh, by Choo He, of which De Mailla's
\par History of China professes to be a translation.
\par This states that the inundation happened in the sixty-first
\par year of the reign of Yao (2297 B.C.), and that the waters of
\par the Yellow River mingled with those of the Ho-hi-ho and
\par the Yangtsze, ruining all the agricultural country, which was
\par converted into one vast sea.
\par But neither in the Bamboo Books nor in the Shu-king do
\par we find that any local phenomena of importance occurred,
\par with the exception of the inundation. In fact, the first work
\par is singularly silent on the subject, and simply says that in
\par his sixty-first year Yao ordered K'wan of Ts'ung to regulate
\par the Ho, and degraded him in his sixty-ninth for being unable
\par to effect it, as we learn elsewhere.
\par The Shu is more explicit. The Emperor, consulting one
\par of his chief officials on the calamity, says :
\par " chief of
\par the four mountains, destructive in their overflow are the
\par waters of the inundation. In their vast extent they embrace
\par the mountains and overtop the hills, threatening the heavens
\par with their floods, so that the inferior people groan and
\par murmur."
\par According to De Mailla's translation, K'wan laboured uselessly
\par for nine years, the whole country was overrun with
\par briars and brushwood, the people had almost forgotten the
\par art of cultivating the ground they were without the necesTHE
\par DELUGE NOT A MYZH. 131
\par sary seeds and wild animals and birds destroyed all their
\par attempts at agriculture.
\par In this extremity Yao consulted Shun, his subsequent
\par successor, who recommended the appointment of Yu, the
\par son of K'wan, in his father's place.
\par Yu was more successful, and describes his labours as follows
\par :
\par " The inundating waters seemed to assail the heavens,
\par and in their vast extent embraced the mountains and overtopped
\par the hills, so that people were bewildered and overwhelmed.
\par I mounted my four conveyances,* and all along
\par the hills hewed down the woods, at the same time,
\par along with Yih, showing the multitudes how to get flesh
\par to eat.
\par " I also opened passages for the streams throughout the
\par nine provinces, and conducted them to the sea. I deepened,
\par moreover, the channels and canals, and conducted them to
\par the streams, at the same time, along with Tseih, sowing
\par grain, and showing the multitudes how to procure the food
\par of toil in addition to flesh meat."
\par Yu's success is simply chronicled in the Bamboo Books as,
\par " In his seventy-fifth year.Yu, the Superintendent of Works,
\par regulated the Ho."
\par There was a legend extant in China in the times of Pinto,
\par which he gives in his book, of the original Chinese having
\par migrated from a region in the West, and, following the
\par course of the Ho in boats, finally settling in the country
\par adjacent to Pekin. That some such event took place is
\par not unlikely. Its acceptance would explain much that is
\par difficult.
\par The pioneers, pushing through a country infested with
\par *
\par i.e. (according to the Historical Records) a carriage to travel along
\par the dry land, a boat to travel along the water, a sledge to travel through
\par miry places, and, by using spikes, to travel on the bills.

\par hostile aborigines, who would immediately after their passage
\par close up the road of communication behind them pioneers who
\par may have been fugitives from their kindred through political
\par commotions, or expelled by successful enemies would have
\par a further barrier against return, even were they disposed to
\par attempt it, in the strong opposing current which had borne
\par them safely to their new homes.
\par It is probable that such a journey would form an entirely
\par new departure for their history, and that a few generations
\par later it would resemble a nebulous chronological zone, on
\par the far side of which could be dimly seen myths of persons
\par and events representing in reality the history of the not very
\par remote ancestors from whom they had become separated.
\par The early arrivals would have been too much occupied with
\par establishing themselves in their new dominions to be able to
\par give much attention to keeping records or preserving other
\par than the most utilitarian branches of knowledge which they
\par had brought with them. The volumes of their ancestors
\par were probably, like the clay tablets of the royal library of
\par Babylon, not of a portable nature, at all events to fugitives,
\par whose knowledge would, therefore, be rather of a
\par practical than of a cultivated nature, and this would
\par soon become limited for a while to their chiefs and religious
\par instructors, the exigencies of a colony menaced with
\par danger prohibiting any general acquisition or extension of
\par learning.
\par In this way we can account for the community of the
\par fables relating ^to the remote antiquity of the Chinese
\par with those of Chaldean and Indian mythology, and
\par with the highly civilized administration and astrological
\par knowledge possessed by Yao and Shun as herediton of
\par Fuh Hi, &c.
\par We can account for their possession of accurate delineations
\par of the dragon, which would form an important decoration
\par of the standards and robes of ceremony which were
\par THE DELUGE NOT A MYTH. 133
\par companions of their flight, while their descriptions of the
\par animal and its qualities would have already entered into the
\par realms of fanciful exaggeration and myth.
\par The dragon of Yao and Shun's time, and of Yu's time
\par was, in my opinion, an aquatic creature, an alligator ; but
\par the dragon of their ancestors was a land lizard, which may
\par even have existed down to the time of the great cataclysm
\par which we call the Deluge, and the memory of which is best
\par preserved in the Chinese drawings which have been handed
\par down from remote antiquity, and have travelled from the
\par great Central Asian centre, which was once alike its habitat
\par and that of their ancestors. Its history may perhaps become
\par evolved when the great store of book knowledge contained
\par in the cuneiform tablets, representing the culture of the
\par other branch of their great ethnological family, has been
\par more extensively explored.
\par Geologists of the present day have a great objection to the
\par bringing in of cataclysms to account for any considerable
\par natural changes, but this one I conceive to have been of so
\par stupendous a nature as to have been quite capable of
\par both extinguishing a species and confusing the recollection
\par of it. The mere fact of the story of the dragon having
\par survived such a period argues greatly, in my mind, for the
\par reality of its previous existence.
\par Extending our consideration, we are brought face to face
\par with another very important fact, namely, that a large proportion
\par of the human race content themselves with ephemeral
\par structures. Thus, for example, the Chinese neither have
\par now, nor at any time have had, any great architectural works.
\par " The finest building in China is a reproduction, on a large
\par scale, of the tent ; and the wooden construction is always
\par imitated where the materials are stone or marble. The supports,
\par often magnificent logs, brought, at great expense,
\par specially from the Straits, represent tent-poles ; and the roof
\par has always the peaked ends and the curves that recall the
\par 134 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par drooping canvas of the marquee. Architecture evidently
\par died early ; it never had life enough to assimilate the new
\par material which it found when it migrated into China Proper.
\par The yamen is a slightly glorified cottage ; the temple is an
\par improved yamen. Sculpture is equally neglected in this
\par (aesthetically) benighted country. The human form is as
\par dignified and sightly, to Chinese eyes at least, in China as in
\par the West ; but it never seems to have occurred, throughout
\par so many hundreds of years, to any Chinaman to perpetuate
\par it in marble or bronze, or to beautify a city with statues of
\par its deities or great men."*
\par What holds good of the Chinese now, probably holds good
\par of their ancestors and the race from which they parted company
\par in Central Asia five thousand years ago, when they
\par pierced their way eastwards through the savage aborigines
\par of Thibet and Mongolia, pushing aside tribes which closed
\par in again behind them, so as to intercept their return or communication
\par with their mother country a country which may
\par have been equally careless of elaborating stupendous and
\par permanent works of architecture such as other nations glory
\par in possessing, and which, like the pyramids of Egypt and of

\par CHAPTEK V.
\par ON THE TRANSLATION OF MYTHS BETWEEN THE OLD AND
\par THE NEW WORLD.
\par INTERCOURSE between various parts of the old world and the
\par new was probably much more intimate even three or four
\par thousand years ago than we, or at all events our immediate
\par ancestors, have credited. The Deluge Tablets referred to in
\par another chapter contain items from which we gather that
\par sea-going vessels, well equipped and with skilled pilots, were
\par in vogue in the time of Noah, and there is wanting no better
\par proof of their seaworthiness than the fact that his particular
\par craft was able to weather a long-continued tempest which
\par would probably have sunk the greater part of those which
\par keep the seas at the present time. The older, Chinese
\par classics make constant allusions to maritime adventure, and
\par the discovery by Schliemann in ancient Troy* of vases with
\par * Dr. Schliemann found a vase in the lowest strata of his excavations
\par at Hissaiiik with an inscription in an unknown language.
\par Six years ago the Orientalist E. Burnouf declared it to be in Chinese,
\par for which he was generally laughed at at the time.
\par The Chinese ambassador at Berlin, Li Fang-pau, has read and translated
\par the inscription, which states that three pieces of linen gauze are
\par packed in the vase for inspection.
\par The Chinese ambassador fixes the date of the inscription at about
\par 1200 B.C., and further states that the unknown characters so frequently
\par occurring on the terra cotta are also in the Chinese language, which
\par would show that at this remote period commercial intercourse existed
\par between China and the eastern shores of Asia Minor and Greece.

\par Chinese inscriptions confirms the notion that, at that date at
\par least, commercial exchange was effected between these two
\par widely-distant countries, either directly or by transfer through
\par different entrepots.
\par A more striking example, and one which carries us back
\par to a still earlier epoch, will be afforded if the reported discovery
\par of Chinese vestigia in Egyptian tombs is confirmed
\par by further investigation.
\par The fleets of King Solomon penetrated at least to India,
\par and detached squadrons* probably coasted from island to
\par island along the Malay archipelago ; while to descend by
\par gradation to modern times, we may quote the circumnavigation
\par of Africa by Hanno the Carthaginian, f the discovery
\par * Pierre Bergeron suggests that Solomon's fleets, starting from
\par Ezion-geber (subsequently Berenice and now Alcacu), arrived at Babelmandeb,
\par and then divided, one portion going to Malacca, Sumatra, or
\par Java, the other to Sofala, round Africa, and returning by way of Cadiz
\par and the Mediterranean to Joppa.
\par f There are various accounts of the circumnavigation of Africa in
\par old times. For example, Herodotus (Melpomene, 42) :
\par "
\par Libya shows
\par itself to be surrounded by water, except so much of it as borders upon
\par Asia. Neco, King of Egypt, was the first whom we know of that proved
\par this; he, when he had ceased digging the canal leading from the Nile
\par to the Arabian gulf, sent certain Phoenicians in ships with orders to
\par sail back through the pillars of Hercules into the Northern Sea, and so
\par to return to Egypt. The Phoenicians accordingly, setting out from the
\par Red Sea, navigated the Southern Sea ; when autumn came they went
\par ashore, and sowed the land, by whatever part of Libya they happened
\par to be sailing, and waited for harvest ; then, having reaped the corn,
\par they put to sea again. When two years had thus passed, in the third,
\par having doubled the pillars of Hercules, they arrived in Egypt, and
\par related what to me does not seem credible, but may to others, that as
\par they sailed round Libya, they had the sun on the right hand." Again,
\par Pliny tells us (Book ii. chap. Ixvii, Translation by Bostock and Eiley),
\par " While the power of Carthage was at its height, Hanno published an
\par account of a voyage which he made from Gades to the extremity of
\par Arabia : besides, we learn from Cornelius Nepos, that one Eudoxus, a

\par it does not appear to have struck any of the commentators
\par on this question that the name " islands of Wak Wak "
\par may
\par be assumed to signify simply "Bird of Paradise islands."

\par as well as that other recorded by Eesa or Moosa the son of
\par El Mubarak Es Serafee.* "Here, too, is a tree that bears
\par fruit like women with bodies, eyes, limbs, &c. like those of
\par women ; they have beautiful faces, and are suspended by the
\par hair ; they come forth from integuments like large leathern
\par bags ; and when they feel the air and the sun they cry out
\par ' Wak Wak '
\par until their hair is cut, and when it is cut they
\par die ; and the people of these islands understand their cry,
\par and augur ill from it." This, after all, is not more absurd
\par than the story of the origin of the barnacle duck, extant and
\par believed in Europe until within the last century or so.
\par El Edrisi, who, in common with the geographers of the

\par and a savage population.f
\par The two small towns may very well have been encampments

\par entirely naked, and only wear combs of ivory ornamented

\par Lane thinks the Arabs applied the name of Wak Wak to
\par all the islands with which they were acquainted on the east
\par and south-east of Borneo. Es Serafee, beside the details
\par given in a previous note, also says,
\par " From one of these
\par islands of Wak Wak there issueth a great torrent like pitch,
\par which floweth into the sea, and the fish are burnt thereby,
\par and float upon the water." And Hasan, in the story quoted
\par above, has, in order to reach the last of the seven islands of
\par Wak Wak, to pass over the third island, the land of the
\par Jinn,
\par " where by reason of the vehemence of the cries of

\par and the smoke from their mouths, and the harsh sounds

\par instances, the volcanic islands of Java, and other of the

\par The information in our possession is as yet too meagre
\par to permit of our indulging in any profitable consideration of
\par the sources from which originated those nations which
\par peopled America during the very early pre-traditional ages,
\par of which geological evidence is accumulating daily. In fact,
\par the theories on this point have advanced so little beyond the

\par than quote one of them, as summarized in the ensuing
\par extract. " Professor Flowers, in remarking upon recent

\par the New ; and that many, such as the horse, rhinoceros,
\par and the camel, are more numerous in species and varieties in
\par the latter, infers that the means of land communication must
\par have been very different to what it is now, and that it is
\par quite as likely that Asiatic man may have been derived from
\par America as the reverse, or both may have had their source
\par in a common centre, in some region of the earth now
\par covered with sea."*
\par The most commonly accepted theory with regard to the
\par origin of those who have peopled the American continent,
\par within the limits of tradition, is that they are of Asiatic
\par descent, and that the migration has been effected in comparatively
\par recent times by way of Behring Straits, and supplemented
\par by chance passages from Southern Asia by way of
\par the Polynesian islands, or from the north of Africa, across

\par Professor Flowers' suggestion, and contend, in opposition to
\par the more generally received opinion, that the peopling of the
\par present countries of the Old World has in fact been effected
\par from the New.
\par For instance, a proficient Aztec scholar, Senor Altamiranof
\par of Mexico, argues that the Aztecs were a race, originating
\par in the unsubmerged parts of America, as old as the Asiatics
\par themselves, and that Asia may in fact have been peopled from
\par Mexico; while Mr. E. J. Elliott, in quoting him, says:
\par " From the ruins recently found, the most northern of any
\par yet discovered, the indications of improved architecture, the
\par work of different ages, can be traced in a continual chain to
\par Mexico, when they culminate in massive and imposing structures,

\par Altamirano's reasoning."

\par Again,
\par " Dr. Rudolf Falb* discovers that the language
\par spoken by the Indians in Peru and Bolivia, especially in
\par Quichua and Aymara, exhibits the most astounding affinities
\par with the Semitic languages, and particularly with the Arabic
\par in which tongue Dr. Falb himself has been skilled from
\par his boyhood. Following up the links of this discovery, he
\par has first found a connecting link with the Aryan roots, and,
\par secondly, has arrived face to face with the surprising revelation
\par that the Semitic roots are universally Aryan. The
\par common stems of all the variants are found in their purest
\par condition in Quichua and Aymara, from which fact Dr. Falb
\par derives the conclusion that the high plains of Peru and
\par Bolivia must be regarded as the point of exit of the present
\par human race."
\par On the other hand, Mr. E. B. Tylor, in the course of an
\par article upon Backgammon among the Aztecs, f which he
\par argues must have reached them from Asia, and very likely
\par through Mexico, points out that the myths and religion of
\par the North American tribes contain many fancies well known
\par to Asia, which they were hardly likely to have hit upon independently,
\par and which they had not learned from white men :
\par " Such as the quaint belief that the world is a monstrous
\par tortoise floating on the waters ; and an idea which the Sioux
\par have in common with the Tartars, that it is sinful to chop or
\par poke with a sharp instrument the burning log on the fire."
\par He quotes Alexander von Humboldt as having
\par "
\par argued years
\par ago that the Mexicans did and believed things which were at
\par once so fanciful and so like the fancies of the Asiatics that
\par there must have been communication. Would two nations,"
\par he asks,
\par " have taken independently to forming calendars of
\par days and years by repeating and combining cycles of animals,
\par such as tiger, dog, ape, hare, &c. ? Would they have deve-

\par loped independently similar astrological fancies about these
\par signs governing the periods they began, and being influential
\par each over a particular limb or organ of men's bodies ?
\par Would they, again, have evolved separately out of this consciousness
\par the myths of the world and its inhabitants having,
\par at the end of several successive periods, been destroyed by
\par elemental catastrophes ?
\par "
\par He adds,
\par " It may very well have been the same agency
\par which transported to Mexico the art of bronze-making, the
\par computation of time by periods of dogs and apes, the casting
\par of nativity, and the playing of backgammon.
\par "
\par Then, again, we have the theory of those, now indeed few
\par in number, who hold that the present Indian inhabitants of
\par America were a distinctly indigenous race. Lord Kaimes, in
\par his Sketches of the History of Man, says,
\par " I venture still
\par further, which is to conjecture that America has not been
\par peopled from any part of the Old World." Voltaire had
\par preceded him in this line of argument, relying on ridicule
\par rather than on reason. " The same persons that readily
\par admit that the beavers of Canada are of Canadian origin,
\par assert that the men must have come there in boats, and that
\par Mexico must have been peopled by some of the descendants
\par of Magog."*

\par can hardly be questioned that the Indians of South America
\par are descended from a class of the Hindoos in the southern
\par part of Asia.
\par Amongst others, Captain Don Antonio del Rio, who
\par described the ruins of an ancient city in Guatemala, believed
\par that they were the relics of a civilization founded by Phoenician
\par colonists who had crossed the Atlantic ocean ; and yet
\par another theory is propounded by Mr. Knox,* who considers
\par the extinct Guanches, formerly inhabiting the Canary and
\par Cape de Verde islands, to have closely resembled the Egyptians
\par in certain particulars. He goes on to observe,
\par " Now
\par cross the Atlantic, and in a nearly parallel zone of the earth,
\par or at least in one not far removed, we stumble all at once
\par upon the ruined cities of Copan and Central America. To
\par our astonishment, notwithstanding the breadth of the
\par Atlantic, vestiges, of a nature not to be doubted, of a
\par thoroughly Egyptian character reappear hieroglyphics,
\par monolithic temples, pyramids ; who erected these monuments
\par on the American continent ? Perhaps at some remote period
\par the continents were not so far apart, they might have been
\par united, thus forming a zone or circle of the earth occupied
\par by a pyramid-building people."
\par It is not impossible that all of these theories may be
\par correct, and that numerous migrations may have been made
\par at various periods by different nations, the most facile would
\par of course be that from North-Eastern Asia by way of the
\par Aleutian islands, for, as the author of Fu-sang well remarks,
\par a sailor in an open boat might cross from Asia to America
\par by that route in summer time, and hardly ever be out of
\par sight of land ; and this in a part of the sea generally
\par abounding in fish, as is proved by the fishermen who inhabit
\par many of these islands, on which fresh water is always to be
\par found. But it is more than likely that the direct route,
\par * Eobert Knox, The Races of Men j London, 1850,
\par OLD AND NEW WORLD MYTHS. 147
\par from the islands of Japan to the coast of California or
\par Mexico, was also occasionally followed, voluntarily or involuntarily,
\par by mariners impelled by enterprise, religious
\par motives, or stress of weather.
\par Colonel B. Kennon, as an evidence of the possibility of
\par junks performing long ocean voyages, adduces the instance
\par of a Japanese junk picked up by an American whaler two
\par thousand three hundred miles south-east of Japan, and of
\par others which had drifted among the Aleutian islands nearly
\par half-way over to San Francisco ; and in noting the resemblance
\par and probable co-origin of the Sandwich Islanders with
\par the Japanese, he adverts to the " ancient and confirmed
\par habit of both Japanese and Chinese of taking women to sea
\par with them, or of traders keeping their families on board,
\par which would fully account for the population of those
\par islands," or, to extend the argument, of points on the
\par American continent. The Jewish element might easily be
\par introduced through this channel, for the occasional admixture
\par of Jewish blood both among the Chinese and Japanese is
\par so strongly marked, as to have induced some authors to
\par contend for the absolute descent of the latter people at least
\par from Jewish parentage.
\par It must also be remembered that the waters of both the
\par North and South Pacific are peculiarly favourable to the
\par navigation of small craft, and that Captain Bligh, after
\par the mutiny on board the Bounty, was able to safely perform
\par a journey of two thousand miles in an open boat; while all
\par the islands both in North and South Polynesia must necessarily
\par have been gradually peopled by the drifting over the
\par ocean of stray canoes.
\par Again, as the tradition of the existence of a large continent
\par west of the African coast was extant amongst the
\par Egyptian priests long before the days of Solon, and, as I
\par shall show hereafter, among the Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians,
\par it is, I think, more than probable that both Phoenician

\par and Egyptian mariners, either acting under a Koyal Commission,
\par or influenced by mercantile considerations, would
\par endeavour to discover it, and, as in the case of Columbus,
\par would have no difficulty in stretching across the Atlantic
\par before a fair trade wind, though they might be less successful
\par than him on their return.
\par The possibility of the existence of a large island or continent,
\par midway between the Old and New World, within the
\par traditional period, is included in the important question,
\par which is still sub judice amongst geologists, whether the
\par general disposition of land and water has or has not been
\par variable during past ages. Sir Charles Lyell held the first
\par view, and was of opinion* that complete alternations of the
\par positions of continent and ocean had repeatedly occurred in
\par geological time.
\par The opposite idea has been suggested at various dates by
\par eminent authorities, suggested rather than sustained by
\par elaborate arguments, until recently, when the question has
\par been re-examined by Mr. Wallace and Dr. Carpenter.
\par The former, in that chapter of island life devoted to the
\par permanence of continents, dwells forcibly upon Dr. Darwin's
\par inference from the paucity of oceanic islands affording fragments
\par of either Palaeozoic or Secondary formations "that
\par perhaps during the Palaeozoic and Secondary periods neither
\par continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans
\par now extend ; for, had they existed, Palaeozoic and Secondary
\par formations would in all probability have been accumulated
\par from sediment derived from their wear and tear ; and these
\par would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations
\par of level which must have intervened during these enormously
\par long periods. If, then, we may infer anything from
\par these facts, we may infer that, where our oceans now extend,
\par oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we
\par *
\par Principles of Geology, chap. xii.
\par OLD AND NEW WORLD MYTHS. 149
\par have any record ; and, on the other hand, that where continents
\par now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected
\par no doubt to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian
\par period."
\par I am not aware whether Dr. Darwin has expressed himself
\par more authoritatively on this point in later works, or whether
\par the whole question has been discussed in detail otherwise
\par than by Mr. Wallace in the chapter referred to, in which he
\par quotes what must, I think, after all, only be taken in the
\par light of a suggestion as an auxiliary to the powerful arguments
\par which he himself has enunciated in favour of a
\par similar conclusion. There is no doubt that the paucity of
\par any but volcanic or coralline islands throughout the greatest
\par extent of existing oceans has a certain but not absolute
\par significance, so far as recent geological epochs are concerned.
\par There is another line of reasoning, debated by Mr. Wallace,
\par based on the formation of the Palaeozoic and Secondary
\par strata from the waste of broken continents and islands occupying
\par generally the site of the existing continents, and
\par separated by insignificant distances of inland sea or extensions
\par from the adjacent oceans. It is soundly based on their
\par lithological structure, as generally indicative of a littoral and
\par shallow water origin, but it seems to me to be only positive
\par so far as it shows that, throughout geological time, some land
\par has existed somewhere within the limits of the present upheaval,
\par and simply negative as to what may or may not have
\par been the condition of what are now the great ocean spaces
\par of the world. Indeed, it would at first sight seem only
\par reasonable to infer, that the very depressions which caused
\par the inundations of Europe and Asia, during the deposition of
\par any important formation, would imply a corresponding elevation
\par elsewhere, in order that the same relative areas of land
\par and water might be maintained.
\par This view has, however, been reduced in its proportions by
\par Dr. Carpenter, who has levelled the results of the recent
\par 150 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par researches by the Challenger expedition against the advocates
\par of the intermutations of land and ocean, and, in pursuing
\par another line of reasoning from Mr. Wallace, has estimated
\par the solid contents of ocean and land above the sea-level
\par respectively, as bearing the proportion of thirty-six to one.
\par So that, supposing all the existing land of the globe to sink
\par down to the sea-level, this subsidence would be balanced by
\par the elevation of only one thirty-sixth part of the existing
\par ocean floor from its present depth to the same level.
\par It must be admitted that the balance of argument was
\par until lately considerably against the former existence of the
\par country of Atlantis, whose ghostly outlines, however, we
\par could almost imagine to be sketched out by faint contours in
\par the chart illustrative of the North Atlantic portion of the
\par Challenger investigations. But it was not so overwhelming as
\par to entitle us to ignore the story entirely as a fable. I do not
\par conceive it impossible that some centrally situated and
\par perhaps volcanic island may once have existed, sufficiently
\par important to have served as the basis of simple legends,
\par which, under the enchantment of distance and time became
\par metamorphosed and enriched.
\par Mr. A. K. Grote suggests that it is simply a myth founded
\par on the observation of low-lying clouds in a sun-flushed sky,
\par which gave the appearance like islands on a golden sea.
\par Mr. Donelly, on the other hand, in a very exhaustive and
\par able volume, contends first, that Atlantis actually existed, and
\par secondly, that it was the origin of our present civilization,
\par that its kings are represented by the gods of Greek mythology,
\par and that its destruction originated our Deluge story.
\par The well-known story is contained in an epic of Plato, of
\par which two fragments only remain, found in two dialogues
\par (the TimsBus and the Critias). Critias is represented as

\par ^Elian, again, contains an extract from Theophrastus, who

\par imply anything else than an acquaintance with America. It
\par is in the form of a dialogue between Midas the Phrygian and
\par Silenus.
\par The latter informs Midas that Europe, Asia, and Africa

\par " Its soil is fruitful, a great part rising in mountains, but

\par Gardens abound, stored with various trees and numerous
\par orchards, intersected by pleasant streams.

\par drinking taverns, beautifully situated in gardens, are everywhere
\par met with ; as the convenient situation of these largely
\par invites to pleasure, they are frequented during the summer
\par season.
\par " The mountain region possesses numerous and large
\par forests, and various kinds of fruitful trees. It everywhere
\par presents deep valleys and springs suitable for mountain
\par recreations.
\par " Indeed the whole of this island is watered with springs
\par of sweet water, which gives rise not merely to the pleasure
\par of its inhabitants, but also to an accession of their health
\par and strength.
\par "
\par Hunting furnishes all kinds of game, the abundance of
\par which in their banquets leaves nothing to be desired.
\par "Moreover, the sea which washes against this island
\par abounds with fish, since the ocean, from its nature everywhere,
\par affords a variety of fish.
\par "
\par Finally, the temperature is very genial, from which it
\par results that the trees bear fruit throughout the greater part
\par of the year.
\par "
\par Lastly, it excels so much in felicity as to resemble the
\par habitations of the gods rather than of men.
\par "
\par Formerly it was unknown, on account of the remoteness
\par of its situation from the rest of the world, but accident disclosed
\par its position. The Phoenicians have been in the habit
\par of making frequent passages, for the sake of commerce, from
\par the very oldest dates, from whence it resulted that they were
\par the founders of many of the African colonies, and of not a
\par few of those European ones situated to the west ; and when
\par they had yielded to the idea which had entered their minds,
\par of enriching themselves greatly, they passed out beyond the
\par Pillars of Hercules into the sea which is called the Ocean,
\par and they first founded a city called Gades, on the European
\par peninsula, and near the straits of the Pillars [of Hercules]
\par in which, when others had flocked to it, they instituted a
\par OLD AND NEW WORLD MYTHS. 153
\par sumptuous temple to Hercules. This temple has been held
\par in the utmost veneration both in ancient times and during
\par later periods up to the present day ; therefore many Eomans
\par of illustrious nobility and reputation pronounce their vows to
\par that god, and happily discharge their obligations.
\par " The Phoenicians for this reason continued their exploration
\par beyond the Pillars, and when they were sailing along the
\par African coast, being carried off by a tempest to a distant part of
\par the ocean, were driven by the violence of the storm, after a
\par period of many days, to the island of which I have spoken,
\par and having first acquainted themselves with its nature and
\par pleasing characters, introduced it to the notice of others.
\par On that account, the Tyrrhenians, also obtaining the empire
\par of the sea, determined on a colony there, but the Carthaginians
\par prevented them, both because they feared lest many of
\par their citizens, being allured by the advantages of the island,
\par might migrate there, and because they wished to have a
\par refuge prepared for themselves against a sudden stroke of
\par fortune, if by chance the Carthaginian Kepublic should
\par receive any deadly blow, for they contemplated that they
\par would be able, while yet powerful at sea, to transport themselves

\par THE DRAGON.
\par FIG. 33. Draco, OR FLYING LIZARD FROM
\par SINGAPORE. (After N. B. Dennys.\}
\par THE dragon is denned in
\par the Encyclopaedia Britannica
\par for 1877 as " the name given
\par by the ancients to a huge
\par winged lizard or serpent (fabulous).''
\par The text also goes on to
\par state that "they (the ancients)
\par regarded it as the
\par enemy of mankind, and its
\par overthrow is made to figure
\par among the greatest exploits
\par of the gods and heroes of
\par heathen mythology. A dragon
\par watched the gardens of
\par the Hesperides, and its destruction
\par formed one of the
\par seven labours of Hercules.
\par Its existence does not seem to
\par have been called in question
\par by the older naturalists ;
\par figures of the dragon appearing
\par in the works of Gesner
\par and Aldrovandus, and even
\par specimens of the monster,
\par evidently formed artificially of
\par portions of different animals,
\par 160 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par have been exhibited." A reference is also made to the
\par genus Draco, comprising eighteen specimens of winged
\par lizards, all small, and peculiar to India and the islands of
\par the Malay archipelago.
\par Such is the meagre account of a creature which figures in
\par the history and mythology of all nations, which in its different
\par forms has been worshipped as a god, endowed with
\par beneficent and malevolent attributes, combatted as a monster,
\par or supposed to have possessed supernatural power, exercised
\par alternately for the benefit or chastisement of mankind.
\par Its existence is inseparably wedded to the history, from
\par the most remote antiquity, of a nation which possesses connected
\par and authentic memoirs stretching uninterruptedly
\par from the present day far into the remote past ; on which
\par the belief in its existence has been so strongly impressed,
\par that it retains its emblem in its insignia of office, in its ornamentation
\par of furniture, utensils, and dwellings, and commemorates
\par it annually in the competition of dragon boats,
\par and the processions of dragon images ; which believes, or
\par affects to believe, in its continued existence in the pools of
\par the deep, and the clouds of the sky ; which propitiates it
\par with sacrifices and ceremonies, builds temples in its honour,
\par and cultivates its worship ; whose legends and traditions
\par teem with anecdotes of its interposition in the affairs of man,
\par and whose scientific works, of antiquity rivalling that of our
\par oldest Western Classics, treat of its existence as a sober and
\par accepted fact, and differentiate its species with some exactness.
\par It is, moreover, though not very frequently, occasionally
\par referred to in the Biblical history of that other ancient,
\par and almost equally conservative branch of the human race,
\par the Jews, not as a myth, or doubtfully existent supernatural
\par monster, but as a tangible reality, an exact terrible creature.
\par Equally do we find it noticed in those other valuable
\par records of the past which throw cross lights upon the Bible
\par narrative, and confirm by collateral facts the value of its

\par careful narrative of Josephus, and the grand resurrection of
\par Chaldsean and Assyrian lore effected by the marvellously well
\par directed and fortunate labour of GK H. Smith and those who
\par follow in his train.
\par Among the earliest classics of Europe, its existence is
\par asserted as a scientific fact, and accepted by poets as a sound
\par basis for analogies, comparisons, allegories, and fable ; it
\par appears in the mythology of the Goth, and is continued
\par through the tradition and fable of every country of Europe ;
\par nor does it fail to appear even in the imperfect traditions of
\par the New World,* where its presence may be considered as
\par comparatively indigenous, and undetermined by the communications
\par dependent on the so-called discovery of later days.
\par Turning to other popular accounts, we find equally limited
\par and incredible versions of it. All consider it sufficiently
\par disposed of by calling it fabulous,t and that a sufficient
\par explanation of any possible belief in it is afforded by a reference]:
\par to the harmless genus of existing flying lizards referred
\par to above.
\par * " In turning to the consideration of the primitive works of art of
\par the American continent . . . when in the bronze work of the later iron
\par period, imitative forms at length appear, they are chiefly the snake and
\par dragon shapes and patterns, borrowed seemingly by Celtic and Teutonic
\par wanderers, with the wild fancies of their mythology, from the far eastern
\par land of their birth." D. Wilson, Prehistoric Man, 1862.

\par Some consider it an evolution of the fancy, typifying
\par noxious principles; thus, Chambers* says,
\par " The dragon
\par appears in the mythical history and legendary poetry of
\par almost every nation as the emblem of the destructive and
\par anarchical principle ; ... as misdirected physical force
\par and untamable animal passions. . . . The dragon proceeds
\par openly to work, running on its feet with expanded wings,
\par and head and tail erect, violently and ruthlessly outraging
\par decency and propriety, spouting fire and fury both from
\par mouth and tail, and wasting and devastating the whole
\par land/'
\par The point which strikes me as most interesting in this
\par passage is the reference to the legendary theory of the mode
\par of the dragon's progress, which curiously calls to mind the
\par semi-erect attitude of the existing small Australian frilled
\par lizard (Chlamijdosaurus). This attitude is also ascribed to
\par some of the extinct American Dinosaurs, such as the Stegosaurus.

\par accepted as a real contemporary of primitive man,f which

\par No one has endeavoured to collate the vast bulk of materials
\par shrouded in the stories of all lands. If this were perfectly
\par effected, a diagnosis of the real nature of the dragon
\par might perhaps be made, and the chapter of its characteristics,
\par alliances, and habits completed like that of any other wellestablished
\par species.
\par The following sketch purposes only to initiate the task
\par here propounded, the author's access to materials being
\par limited, and only sufficient to enable him, as he thinks, to
\par establish generally the proposition which it involves, to grasp
\par as it were some of the broader and salient features of the
\par investigation, while leaving a rich gleaning of corroborative
\par information for the hand of any other who may please to
\par continue and extend his observations.
\par At the outset it will be necessary to assign a much more
\par extended signification to the word dragon than that which is
\par contained in the definition at the head of this chapter. The
\par popular mind of the present day doubtless associates it
\par always with the idea of a creature possessing wings ; but
\par the Lung of the Chinese, the SpdKw of the Greeks, the
\par and who had all the characteristics of what we now call chimeras and
\par dragons, and perhaps of such monsters the remains, found among the
\par bones and skeletons of other animals more resembling those that still
\par exist and propagate, in the grottos and caverns in which they sought
\par shelter during the deluges that affected the infancy of the globe, gave
\par first rise to the idea that these dens and caves were once retreats whence
\par such monsters watched and in which they devoured other animals."-
\par Thomas Hope, On the Origin and Prospects of Man, vol. ii. p. 346 ;
\par London, 1831.
\par Southey, in his Commonplace Book, pityingly alludes to this passage,
\par saying, "He believes in dragons and griffins as having heretofore
\par existed."
\par THE DRAGON. 165
\par Draco of the Eomans, the Egyptian dragon, and the Ndga of
\par the Sanscrit have no such limited signification, and appear to
\par have been sometimes applied to any serpent, lacertian, or
\par saurian, of extraordinary dimensions, nor is it always easy
\par to determine from the passages in which these several terms
\par occur what kind of monster is specially indicated.
\par Thus the dragon referred to by Propertius in the quotation
\par annexed may have been a large python.
\par " Lanuvium* is,
\par of old, protected by an aged dragon ; here, where the occasion

\par A somewhat inexplicable habit is ascribed to the dragon in
\par Book ix.* :
\par " When the draco has eaten much fruit, it seeks
\par the juice of the bitter lettuce ; it has been seen to do this."
\par Pliny, probably quoting Aristotle, f also states that the

\par It is doubtful whether large serpents, or real dragons, are
\par referred to by Pliny in the following interesting passages
\par which I give at length : the surprise which he expresses at
\par Juba's believing that they had crests, leads me to suspect
\par that there was possibly some confusion of species involved ;
\par that Juba might have been perfectly accurate so far as the
\par crests are concerned, and that the beasts in question, in place
\par of being pythons of magnitude, were rather some gigantic
\par lizard-like creature, of great length and little bulk, corresponding
\par with the Chinese idea of the dragon, and, therefore,
\par naturally bearing horny crests, similar to those with which the
\par monster is usually represented by the latter people.
\par It must be noticed here, that if we postulate the existence
\par of the dragon, we are not bound to limit ourselves to a single
\par species, or even two, as the same causes which effected the
\par gradual destruction of one would be exceedingly likely to
\par effect that of another ; we must not, therefore, be too critical
\par in comparing descriptions of different authors in different

\par He says that it is a large island on the confines of China towards India,
\par and that among other remarkable features is a mountain called Nacan
\par (Kini Balu ?), on which are serpents of such magnitude as to be able to
\par swallow oxen, buffaloes, and even elephants. Masudi includes Zanig,

\par countries and epochs, since they may refer only to allied, but
\par not identical, animals.
\par " Africa produces elephants, but it is India that produces
\par the largest, as well as the dragon, who is perpetually at war
\par with the elephant, and is itself of so enormous a size, as
\par easily to envelop the elephants with its folds, and encircle
\par them in its coils. The contest is equally fatal to both ; the
\par elephant, vanquished, falls to the earth, and by its weight
\par crushes the dragon which is entwined around it.*
\par " The sagacity which every animal exhibits in its own
\par behalf is wonderful, but in these it is remarkably so. The
\par dragon has much difficulty in climbing up to so great a
\par height, and therefore, watching the road, which bears marks
\par of their footsteps, when going to feed, it darts down upon
\par them from a lofty tree. The elephant knows that it is
\par quite unable to struggle against the folds of the serpent, and
\par so seeks for trees or rocks against which to rub itself.
\par " The dragon is on its guard against this, and tries to
\par prevent it, by first of all confining the legs of the elephant
\par with the folds of its tail ; while the elephant, on the other
\par hand, tries to disengage itself with its trunk. The dragon,
\par however, thrusts its head into its nostrils, and thus, at the
\par same moment, stops the breath, and wounds the most tender
\par parts. When it is met unexpectedly, the dragon raises itself
\par up, faces its opponent, and flies more especially at the eyes ;
\par this is the reason why elephants are so often found blind,
\par and worn to a skeleton with hunger and misery.
\par " There is another story, too, told in relation to these
\par combats. The blood of the elephant, it is said, is remarkably
\par cold ; for which reason, in the parching heats of summer,
\par it is sought by the dragon with remarkable avidity. It lies,
\par therefore, coiled up and concealed in the river, in wait for

\par the elephants when they come to drink ; upon which it darts
\par out, fastens itself around the trunk, and then fixes its teeth
\par behind the ear, that being the only place which the elephant
\par cannot protect with the trunk. The dragons, it is said, are
\par of such vast size that they can swallow the whole of the
\par blood; consequently the elephant, being drained of its blood,
\par falls to the earth exhausted ; while the dragon, intoxicated
\par with the draught, is crushed beneath it, and so shares its fate.*

\par Ethiopia produces dragons, not so large as those of
\par India, but still twenty cubits in length. The only thing that
\par surprises me is, how Juba came to believe that they have
\par crests. The Ethiopians are known as the Asachsei, among
\par whom they most abound ; and we are told that on those
\par coasts four or five of them are found twisted and interlaced
\par together like so many osiers in a hurdle, and thus setting
\par sail, with their heads erect, they are borne along upon the
\par waves to find better sources of nourishment in Arabia, "f
\par Pliny then goes on to describe, as separate from dragons,
\par large serpents in India, as follows.
\par "
\par Megasthenesj: informs us that in India serpents grow to
\par such an immense size as to swallow stags and bulls ; while
\par Metrodorus says that about the river Bhyndacus, in Pontus,
\par they seize and swallow the birds that are flying above them,
\par however high and however rapid their flight.
\par " It is a well-known fact that during the Punic war, at the
\par river Bagrada, a serpent one hundred and twenty feet in
\par length was taken by the Koman army under Kegulus, being
\par besieged, like a fortress, by means of balistae and other
\par engines of war. Its skin and jaws were preserved in a temple
\par at Rome down to the time of the Numantine war.

\par boa, render these accounts far from incredible, for they grow
\par to such vast size that a child was found entire in the stomach
\par of one of them which was killed on the Vaticanian Hill
\par during the reign of Emperor Claudius."*
\par Aristotle tells us that u in Libya, the serpents, as it has
\par been already remarked, are very large. For some persons
\par say that as they sailed along the coast, they saw the bones of
\par many oxen, and that it was evident to them that they had
\par been devoured by serpents. And, as the ships passed on, the
\par serpents attacked the triremes, and some of them threw
\par themselves upon one of the triremes and overturned it."f
\par It is doubtful whether the dragons described by Benjamin
\par of Tudela, who travelled through Europe and the East and
\par returned to Castille in 11 734 as infesting the ruins of the
\par palace of Nebuchodonosor at Babylon, so as to render them
\par inaccessible, were creatures of the imagination such as the
\par mediaeval mind seems to have loved to dress up, or venomous
\par serpents. But there is little doubt that the so-called dragons
\par of later voyages were simply boas, pythons, or other large
\par serpents, such as those described by John Leo, in his descrip-

\par or the terror which they then inspired. This subject
\par has been so ably dealt with by a writer of the last century];
\par that I feel no hesitation in transcribing his remarks at length.
\par " It is probable, in early times, when the arts were little
\par known and mankind were but thinly scattered over the earth,
\par that serpents, continuing undisturbed possessors of the forest,
\par grew to an amazing magnitude, and every other tribe of
\par animals fell before them. It then might have happened that
\par the serpents reigned tyrants of the district for centuries
\par together. To animals of this kind, grown by time and rapacity
\par to one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet long, the
\par lion, the tiger, and even the elephant itself were but feeble
\par opponents. That horrible fetor, which even the commonest
\par and the most harmless snakes are still found to diffuse, might
\par in these larger ones become too powerful for any living being
\par to withstand, and while they preyed without distinction, they
\par might also have poisoned the atmosphere round them. In
\par this manner, having for ages lived in the hidden and unpeopled
\par forest, and finding, as their appetites were more
\par powerful, the quantity of their prey decreasing, it is possible

\par they might venture boldly from their retreats into the more
\par cultivated parts of the country, and carry consternation
\par among mankind, as they had before desolation among the
\par lower ranks of nature.
\par " We have many histories of antiquity presenting us such
\par a picture, and exhibiting a whole nation sinking under the
\par ravages of a single serpent. At that time man had not
\par learned the art of uniting the efforts of many to effect one
\par great purpose. Opposing multitudes only added new victims
\par to the general calamity, and increased mutual embarrassment
\par and terror. The animal, therefore, was to be singly opposed
\par by him who had the greatest strength, the best armour, and
\par the most undaunted courage. In such an encounter hundreds
\par must have fallen, till one more lucky than the rest, by
\par a fortunate blow, or by taking the monster in its torpid
\par interval and surcharged with spoil, might kill and thus rid
\par his country of the destroyer. Such was the original occupation
\par of heroes.
\par " But as we descend into more enlightened antiquity we
\par find these animals less formidable, as being attacked in a
\par more successful manner.
\par " We are told that while Eegulus led his army along the
\par banks of the river Bagrada in Africa, an enormous serpent
\par disputed his passage over. We are assured by Pliny that it
\par was one hundred and twenty feet long, and that it had
\par destroyed many of the army. At last, however, the batteriog
\par engines were brought out against it, and then, assailing it at
\par a distance, it was destroyed. Its spoils were carried to Borne,
\par and the general was decreed an ovation for his success.
\par " There are, perhaps, few facts better ascertained in history
\par than this : an ovation was a remarkable honour, and
\par was only given for some signal exploit that did not deserve a
\par triumph. No historian would offer to invent that part of
\par the story, at least, without being subject to the most shameful
\par detection.

\par " The skin was kept for several years after, in the Capitol,
\par and Pliny says he saw it there.
\par " This tribe of animals, like that of fishes, seem to have
\par no bounds put to their growth ; their bones are in a great
\par measure cartilaginous, and they are consequently capable of
\par great extension.
\par " The older, therefore, a serpent becomes, the larger it
\par grows, and, as they live to a great age, they arrive at an
\par enormous size. Leguat assures us that he saw one in Java
\par that was fifty feet long.* Carli mentions their growing to
\par above forty feet, and there is now in the British Museum one
\par that measures thirty-two feet.
\par " Mr. Wentworth, who had large concerns in the Berbice
\par in America, assures us that in that country they grow to an
\par enormous length. He describes an Indian mistaking one for
\par a log, and proceeding to sit down on it, when it began to
\par move. A soldier with him shot the snake, but the Indian
\par died of fright. It measured thirty-six feet. It was sent to
\par the Hague.
\par " A life of savage hostility in the forest offers the imagination
\par one of the most tremendous pictures in nature. In
\par those burning countries where the sun dries up every brook
\par for hundreds of miles round : where what had the appearance
\par of a great river in the rainy season becomes in summer one
\par dreary bed of sand ; in those countries a lake that is never
\par dry, or a brook that is perennial, is considered by every
\par animal as the greatest convenience of nature. When they
\par have discovered this, no dangers can deter them from attempting
\par to slake their thirst. Thus the neighbourhood of a

\par the place where all the hostile tribes of nature draw up for
\par the engagement.
\par " On the banks of this little envied spot, thousands of
\par animals of various kinds are seen venturing to quench their
\par thirst, or preparing to seize their prey. The elephants are
\par perceived in a long line, marching from the darker parts of
\par the forest. The buffaloes are there, depending upon numbers
\par for security ; the gazelles relying solely upon their swiftness ;
\par the lion and tiger waiting a proper opportunity to seize,
\par " But chiefly the larger serpents are upon guard there, and
\par defend the accesses of the lake. Not an hour passes without
\par some dreadful combat, but the serpent, defended by its scales,
\par and naturally capable of sustaining a multitude of wounds,
\par is of all others the most formidable. It is the most wakeful
\par also, for the whole tribe sleep with their eyes open, and are
\par consequently for ever upon the watch ; so that, till their
\par rapacity is satisfied, few other animals will venture to
\par approach their station."
\par We read of a serpent exhibited in the time of Augustus
\par at Rome, which, Suetonius tells us, "was fifty cubits in
\par length."* But at the present day there are few authentic
\par accounts of snakes exceeding thirty feet in length ; and there

\par " It was strange but interesting to find amongst all Malays
\par a strong belief in the extraordinary size to which the boaconstrictors
\par or pythons would grow ; they all maintained that
\par in the secluded forests of Sumatra or Borneo, as well as on
\par some of the smaller islands which were not inhabited, these
\par snakes were occasionally found of forty or fifty feet in
\par length."
\par Major McNair says* :

\par He had wounded a boar in the jungle, and was following its
\par tracks with his dogs, when, in penetrating further into the

\par beast, and was crushing it to death. A well-directed

\par which is also laid in the Malay peninsula, lacks the authenticity

\par jungle lying between Buddoh and Sirangoon, came upon a
\par lone hut in a district called Campong Batta, upon the roof of
\par which the skin of an enormous boa or python (whichever
\par may be the correct name) was spread out. The hut was
\par occupied by a Malay and his wife, from whom our informant
\par gathered the following extraordinary account. One night,
\par about a week previously, the Malay was awakened by the
\par cries of his wife for assistance. Being in perfect darkness,
\par and supposing the alarm to be on account of thieves, he
\par seized his sharp parang, and groped his way to her sleeping
\par place, where his hand fell upon a slimy reptile. It was
\par fully a minute before he could comprehend the entire situation,
\par and when he did, he discovered that the whole of his
\par wife's arm had been drawn down the monster's throat,
\par whither the upper part of her body was slowly but surely
\par following. Not daring to attack the monster at once for fear
\par of causing his wife's death, the husband, with great presence
\par of mind, seized two bags within reach, and commenced stuffing
\par them into the corner of the snake's jaws, by means of
\par which he succeeded in forcing them wider open and releasing
\par his wife's arm. No sooner had the boa lost his prey than he
\par attacked the husband, whom he began encircling in his fatal
\par coils ; but holding out both arms, and watching his opportunity,
\par he attacked the monster so vigorously with his parang
\par that it suddenly unwound itself and vanished through an
\par opening beneath the attap sides of the hut. His clothes
\par were covered with blood, as was also the floor of the hut, and
\par his wife's arm was blue with the squeezing it received between
\par the boa's jaws. At daylight the husband discovered his
\par patch of plaintain trees nearly ruined, where the boa, writhing
\par in agony, had broken off the trees at the roots, and in the
\par midst of the debris lay the monster itself, dead. The Malay
\par assured our informant that he had received no less than sixty
\par dollars from Chinese, who came from long distances to purchase

\par which he preferred to retain as a trophy. It was greatly
\par decomposed, having been some days exposed in the open
\par air, and useless for curing. There is no telling what may
\par have been the measurement of this large reptile, but the
\par skin, probably greatly stretched by unskilful removal, measured
\par between seven and eight fathoms."

\par Mr. Moffatt learnt personally from a Mr. Beveridge, son
\par of Mr. Peter Beveridge, of Swan Hill station, that he
\par had actually seen one, and that his account quite tallied
\par with those of the blacks. In answer to an inquiry which
\par I addressed to Australia, I received the note attached
\par below.*
\par Mr. Henry Liddell, who was resident on the Darling River
\par in 1871-72, informs me that he has heard from stock-riders
\par and ration-carriers similar accounts to that of Mr. Moffatt,
\par with reference to the existence of large serpents of the boa
\par species in an adjacent locality, viz. the tract of country lying
\par to the east of Darling and Murray junction, in the back
\par country belonging to Pooncaira station.
\par They described them as being numerous, in barren and
\par rocky places, among big boulders ; fully forty feet long ; as
\par thick as a man's thigh ; and as having the same remarkable
\par odour described by Mr. Moffatt. They spoke of them as
\par quite common, and not at all phenomenal, between Wentworth
\par and Pooncaira.

\par Mr. C. M. Officer states " With reference to the Hindi or Mallee snake,
\par it has often been described to me as a formidable creature of at least
\par thirty feet in length, which confined itself to the Mallee scrub. No one,
\par however, has ever seen one, for the simple reason that to see it is to die,
\par so fierce it is, and so great its power of destruction. Like the Bunyip,
\par I believe the Mindi to be a myth, a mere tradition,"

\par and commonly inhabits the large lakes formed by the riverwater
\par after flood." *
\par Ulloa, also, in his Voyage to South America^ says :
\par " In
\par the countries watered by that vast river (the Maranon) is
\par bred a serpent of a frightful magnitude, and of a most deleterious
\par nature. Some, in order to give an idea of its largeness,
\par affirm that it will swallow any beast whole, and that
\par this has been the miserable end of many a man. But what
\par seems still a greater wonder is the attractive quality attributed
\par to its breath, \{ which irresistibly draws any creature
\par to it which happens to be within the sphere of its attraction.
\par The Indians call it Jacumama, i.e. 'mother of water'; for, as
\par it delights in lakes and marshy places, it may in some sense
\par be considered as amphibious. I have taken a great deal of
\par pains to inquire into this particular, and all I can say is that
\par the reptile's magnitude is really surprising."
\par John Nieuhoff, in his Voyages to Brazil^ speaking of the
\par serpent Guaku or Liboya, says :
\par " It is questionless the
\par biggest of all serpents, some being eighteen, twenty-four, nay
\par thirty feet long, and of the thickness of a man in his middle.
\par The Portuguese call it Kobra Detrado, or the roebuck
\par serpent, because it will swallow a whole roebuck, or any other
\par deer it meets with ; after they have swallowed such a deer,
\par they fall asleep, and so are catched. Such a one I saw at
\par Paraiba, which was thirty feet long, and as big as a barrel.

\par The next section relates to winged serpents, a belief in
\par which was prevalent in early ages, and is strongly supported
\par by several independent works.
\par To my mind, Herodotus speaks without the slightest doubt
\par upon the subject in the following passages. "Arabia* is
\par the last of inhabited lands towards the south, and it is the
\par only country which produces frankincense, myrrh, cassia,
\par cinnamon, and ledanum." " The frankincense they procure
\par by means of the gum styrax, which the Greeks get from the
\par Phoenicians. This they burn, and thereby obtain the spice ;
\par for the trees which bear the frankincense are guarded by
\par *

\par THE DRAGON. 183
\par winged serpents, small in size, and of various colours,
\par whereof vast numbers hang about every tree. They are of
\par the same kind as the serpents that invade Egypt, and there
\par is nothing but the smoke of the styrax which will drive them
\par from the trees."

\par Again,*
\par " the Arabians say that the whole world would
\par swarm with these serpents, if they were not kept in check,
\par in the way in which I know that vipers are." "
\par Now, with
\par respect to the vipers and the winged snakes of Arabia, if they
\par increased as fast as their nature would allow, impossible
\par were it for man to maintain himself upon the earth.
\par Accordingly, it is found that when the male and female come
\par together, at the very moment of impregnation, the female
\par seizes the male by the neck, and having once fastened cannot
\par be brought to leave go till she has bit the neck entirely
\par through, and so the male perishes ; but after a while he is
\par avenged upon the female by means of the young, which,
\par while still unborn, gnaw a passage through the womb and
\par then through the belly of their mother. Contrariwise, other
\par snakes, which are harmless, lay eggs and hatch a vast
\par number of young. Vipers are found in all parts of the
\par world, but the winged serpents are nowhere seen except in
\par Arabia, where they are all congregated together ; this makes
\par them appear so numerous."
\par *
\par Herodotus, Book iii. chap, cviii.
\par 184 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Herodotus had so far interested himself in ascertaining the
\par probability of their existence as to visit Arabia for the
\par purpose of inquiry ; he says,*
\par " I went once to a certain place
\par in Arabia, almost exactly opposite the city of Buto, to make
\par inquiries concerning the winged serpents. On my arrival I
\par saw the back-bones and ribs of serpents in such numbers as
\par it is impossible to describe ; of the ribs there were a multitude
\par of heaps, some great, some small, some middle-sized.
\par The place where the bones lie is at the entrance of a narrow
\par gorge between steep mountains, which there open upon a
\par spacious plain communicating with the great plains of
\par Egypt. The story goes, that with the spring the snakes
\par come flying from Arabia towards Egypt, but are met in this
\par gorge by the birds called ibises, who forbid their entrance
\par and destroy them all. The Arabians assert, and the Egyptians
\par also admit, that it is on account of the service thus
\par rendered that the Egyptians hold the ibis in so much reverence."
\par He further! describes the winged serpent as being
\par shaped like the water-snake, and states that its wings are not
\par feathered, but resemble very closely those of the bat.

\par Josephus* unmistakably affirms his belief in the existence
\par of flying serpents, in his account of the stratagem which
\par Moses adopted in attacking the Ethiopians, who had invaded
\par Egypt and penetrated as far as Memphis. From this we
\par may infer that in his time flying serpents were by no means
\par peculiar to Arabia, but, as might have been expected, equally
\par infested the desert lands bordering the fertile strip of the Nile.
\par In Whiston's translation we read that " Moses prevented
\par the enemies, and took and led his army before those enemies
\par were apprised of his attacking them ; for he did not
\par march by the river, but by land, where he gave a wonderful
\par demonstration of his sagacity ; for when the ground was
\par difficult to be passed over, because of the multitude of serpents
\par (which it produces in vast numbers, and indeed is
\par singular in some of those productions, which other countries
\par do not breed, and yet such as are worse than others in power
\par and mischief, and an unusual fierceness of sight, some of
\par which ascend out of the ground unseen, and also fly in the
\par air, and so come upon men at unawares, and do them a
\par mischief), Moses invented a wonderful stratagem to preserve
\par the army safe and without hurt; for he made baskets, like
\par unto arks, of sedge, and filled them with ibes, and carried
\par them along with them ; which animal is the greatest enemy
\par to serpents imaginable, for they fly from them when they
\par come near them ; and as they fly they are caught and devoured
\par by them, as if it were done by the harts ; but the
\par ibes are tame creatures, and only enemies to the serpentine
\par kind ; but about these ibes I say no more at present, since
\par the Greeks themselves are not unacquainted with this sort
\par of bird. As soon, therefore, as Moses was come to the land,
\par *
\par Antiquities of the Jews, Book ii., chap. x.
\par 186 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par which was the breeder of these serpents, he let loose the ibes,
\par and by their means repelled the serpentine kind, and used them
\par for his assistants before the army came upon that ground."
\par These statements of Herodotus and Josephus are both too
\par precise to be explicable on the theory that they refer to
\par the darting or jumping serpents which Nieuhoff describes,
\par in his day, as infesting the palm trees of Arabia and
\par springing from tree to tree ; or to the jaculus of Pliny,*
\par which darts from the branches of trees, and flies through the
\par air as though it were hurled by an engine, and which is
\par described by ^Elian and graphically figured by Lucanf in
\par the passage
\par " Behold! afar, around the trunk of a barren
\par tree, a fierce serpent Africa calls it the jaculus wreathes
\par itself, and then darts forth, and through the head and pierced
\par temples of Paulus it takes its flight : nothing does venom
\par there effect, death seizes him through the wound. It war
\par then understood how slowly fly the stones which the sling
\par hurls, how sluggishly whizzes the flight of the Scythian
\par arrow."
\par Solinus, whose work, Polyhistor, is mainly a compilation
\par from Pliny's Natural History, gives a similar account of the
\par swarms of winged serpents about the Arabian marshes, and
\par states that their bite was so deadly that death followed the
\par bite before pain could be felt; he also refers to their destruction
\par by the ibises, and is probably only quoting other authors
\par rather than speaking of his own knowledge.
\par Cicero, again, speaks of the ibis as being a very large bird,
\par with strong legs, and a horny long beak, which destroys a
\par great number of serpents, and keeps Egypt free from
\par pestilential diseases, by killing and devouring the flying
\par serpents, brought from the deserts of Lybia by the southwest
\par wind, and so preventing the mischief which might

\par attend their biting while alive, or from any infection when

\par There are not unfrequent allusions in ancient history to
\par serpents having become so numerous as to constitute a
\par perfect plague ; the dreadful mortality caused among the
\par Israelites by the fiery serpents spoken of in Numbers is a
\par case in point, and another *
\par is the migration of the Neuri
\par from their own country into that of the Budini, one generation
\par before the attack of Darius, in consequence of the
\par incursion of a huge multitude of serpents. It is stated that
\par some of these were produced in their own country, but for
\par the most part they came in from the deserts of the north.
\par The home of the Neuri appears to have been to the northwest
\par of the Pontus Euxinus, pretty much in the position of
\par Poland, and I believe that at the present day the only harmful
\par reptile occurring in it is the viper common to the rest
\par of Europe. Diodorus Siculusf mentions a tradition that
\par the Cerastes had once made an irruption into Egypt in
\par such numbers as to have depopulated a great portion of the
\par inhabited districts.
\par These stories are interesting as showing a migratory instinct
\par occurring in certain serpents, either periodically or
\par occasionally, and are thus to some extent corroborative of
\par the account of the annual invasion of Egypt by serpents,
\par referred to in a previous page. They also, I think, confirm
\par the impression that serpents were more numerous in
\par the days of early history, and had a larger area of distribution
\par than they have now, and that possibly some species,
\par such as the Arabian and flying serpents, which have since
\par become extinct, then existed. Thus the boa is spoken of by
\par Pliny as occurring commonly in Italy, and growing to such
\par a vast size that a child was found entire in one of them,
\par which was killed on the Vatican Hill during the reign of the

\par existing there at all corresponding to this description.
\par Parallel instances of invasions of animals materially affecting
\par the prosperity of man are doubtless familiar to my readers,
\par such as the occasional migration of lemmings, passage of
\par rats, flights of locusts, or the ravages caused by the Colorado
\par beetle ; but many are perhaps quite unaware what a
\par terrible plague can be established, in the course of a very
\par few years, by the prolific unchecked multiplication of even so
\par harmless, innocent, and useful an animal as the common
\par rabbit. The descendants of a few imported pairs have laid
\par waste extensive districts of Australia and New Zealand, necessitated
\par an enormous expenditure for their extirpation, and
\par have at the present day* caused such a widespread destruc-
\par * " It may be some comfort to graziers and selectors who are struggling,
\par under many discouragements, to suppress the rabbit plague in
\par Victoria, to learn that our condition, bad as it is, is certainly less serious
\par than that of New Zealand. There, not only is an immense area of good
\par country being abandoned in consequence of the inability of lessees to
\par bear the great expense of clearing the land of rabbits, but, owing to
\par the increase of the pest, the number of sheep depastured is decreasing
\par at a serious rate. Three years ago the number exceeded thirteen millions
\par ; but it is estimated that they have since been diminished by two
\par millions, while the exports of the colony have, in consequence, fallen
\par off to the extent of =500,000 per annum. A Rabbit Nuisance Act has
\par been in existence for some time, but it is obviously inefficient, and it is
\par now proposed to make its provisions more stringent, and applicable
\par alike to the Government as well as to private landowners. A select
\par committee of both Houses of the Legislature, which has recently taken
\par a large amount of evidence upon this subject, reports in the most
\par emphatic terms its conviction that unless immediate and energetic
\par action is taken to arrest the further extension of, and to suppress the
\par plague, the result will be ruinous to the colony. A perusal of the
\par evidence adduced decidedly supports this opinion. Many of the
\par squatters cannot be accused of apathy. Some of them have employed
\par scores of men, and spent thousands of pounds a year in ineffectual
\par efforts to eradicate the rabbits from their runs. One firm last year is

\par It is interesting to find in the work of the Arabic geographer
\par El Edrisi a tradition of an island in the Atlantic,

\par formerly inhabited, but abandoned on account of the excessive
\par multiplication of serpents on it. According to Scaligerus,
\par the mountains dividing the kingdom of Narsinga from

\par enumerated winged dragons, who are able to destroy any

\par Megasthenes (tradente Mliano) relates that winged serpents

\par Similar instances of failure could be easily multiplied. It is found,
\par as with us, that one of the chief causes of non-success is the fact that
\par the G-overnment do not take sufficient steps to destroy the rabbits on

\par diminishes the letting value of the adjacent pastoral country to such
\par an extent, indeed, that instances have occurred in which 34,000 acres
\par have been leased for .10 a year. Poison is regarded as the most
\par destructive agent that can be employed, and it is especially effective
\par when mixed with oats and wheat, a striking testimony to the value of

\par at present, but should be conducted by officers of the Government,
\par probably the sheep inspectors, on a principle similar to that by which
\par the scab was eradicated from the flocks of the colony. The joint committee
\par adopted this view, and also recommended the Legislature to enact
\par that all unoccupied Crown land, as well as all native, reserved, or private
\par land, should bear a proportionate share of the cost of destroying the
\par rabbits, and of administering the act. It is to be hoped that, in the

\par already glanced at ; but we now propose to examine it in
\par greater detail, with reference to countries so distant from
\par their habitat as to render it unlikely that their description
\par had penetrated there.
\par The poets of Greece and Rome introduce the dragon into
\par their fables, as an illustration, when the type of power and
\par ferocity is sought for. Homer, in his description of the
\par shield of Hercules, speaks of " The scaly horror of a dragon
\par coiled full in the central field, unspeakable, with eyes oblique,
\par retorted, that askant shot gleaming fire/' So Hesiod* (750
\par to 700 B.C., Grote), describing the same object, says :
\par " On
\par its centre was the unspeakable terror of a dragon glancing
\par backward with eyes gleaming with fire. His mouth, too,
\par was filled with teeth running in a white line, dread and unapproachable
\par ; and above his terrible forehead, dread strife

\par was hovering, as he raises the battle rout. On it likewise
\par were heads of terrible serpents, unspeakable, twelve in
\par number, who were wont to scare the race of men on earth,
\par whosoever chanced to wage war against the son of Jove/'
\par Here it is noteworthy that Hesiod distinguishes between
\par the dragon and serpents.
\par Ovid* locates the dragon slain by Cadmus in Bceotia,
\par near the river Cephisus. He speaks of it as being hid in a
\par cavern, adorned with crests, and of a golden colour. He,
\par like the other poets, makes special reference to the eyes
\par sparkling with fire, and it may be noted that a similar brilliancy
\par is mentioned by those who have observed pythons in
\par their native condition. He speaks of the dragon as blue^ and
\par terribly destructive owing to the possession of a sting, long
\par constricting folds, and venomous breath.

\par and enter into the city of Heraclea. Though rational explanations
\par are afforded by the theory of Bochart and Le Clerc,
\par that the story is based upon the equivocal meaning of a Phoenician
\par word, signifying either a winged dragon or a ship
\par fastened with iron nails or bolts ; or by that of Philodorus,
\par as cited by Eusebius, who says that his ship was called a
\par flying dragon, from its carrying the figure of a dragon on its
\par prow ; yet either simply transposes into another phase the
\par current belief in a dragon, without prejudicing it.
\par Diodorus Siculus disposes of the Colchian dragon and
\par the golden-fleeced ram in a very summary manner, as
\par follows :
\par "It is said that Phryxus, the son of Athamas and
\par Nephele, in order to escape the snares of his stepmother, fled
\par from Greece with his half-sister Hellen, and that whilst they
\par were being carried, under the advice of the gods, by the ram
\par with a golden fleece out of Europe into Asia, the girl accidentally
\par fell off into the sea, which on that account has
\par been called Hellespont. Phryxus, however, being carried
\par safely into Colchis, sacrificed the ram by the order of an
\par oracle, and hung up its skin in a shrine dedicated to
\par Mars.
\par " After this the king learnt from an oracle that he would
\par meet his death when strangers, arriving there by ship,
\par should have carried off the golden fleece. On this account,
\par * These wood-cuts occur on pp. 239, 240,

\par as well as from innate cruelty, the man was induced to offer
\par sacrifice with the slaughter of his guests ; in order that, the
\par report of such an atrocity being spread everywhere, no one
\par might dare to set foot within his dominions. He also surrounded
\par the temple with a wall, and placed there a strong
\par guard of Taurian soldiery ; which gave rise to a prodigious
\par fiction among the Greeks, for it was reported by them that
\par bulls, breathing fire from their nostrils, kept watch over the
\par shrine, and that a dragon guarded the skin, for by ambiguity
\par the name of the Taurians was twisted into that of bulls, and
\par the slaughter of guests furnished the fiction of the expiation
\par of fire. In like manner they translated the name of the
\par prefect Draco, to whom the custody of the temple had been
\par assigned, into that of the monstrous and horrible creature of
\par the poets."
\par Nor do others fail to give a similar explanation of the
\par fable of Phryxus, for they say that Phryxus was conveyed in
\par a ship which bore on its prow the image of a ram, and that
\par Hellen, who was leaning over the side under the misery of
\par sea-sickness, tumbled into the water.
\par Among other subjects of poetry are the dragon which
\par guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, and the two
\par which licked the eyes of Plutus at the temple of ^Esculapius
\par with such happy effect that he began to see.
\par Philostratus* separates dragons into Mountain dragons and
\par Marsh dragons. The former had a moderate crest, which
\par increased as they grew older, when a beard of saffron colour
\par was appended to their chins ; the marsh dragons had no
\par crests. He speaks of their attaining a size so enormous that
\par they easily killed elephants. ^Elian describes their length
\par as being from thirty or forty to a hundred cubits ; and Posidonius
\par mentions one, a hundred and forty feet long, that

\par of such bulk that two men on horseback, with the monster
\par between them, could not see each%
\par other.
\par Ignatius states that there was in the library of Constantinople
\par the intestine of a dragon one hundred and twenty feet
\par long, on which were written the Iliad and Odyssey in letters
\par of gold. There is no ambiguity in Lucan's* description of
\par the ^Ethiopian dragon :
\par " You also, the dragon, shining
\par with golden brightness, who crawl in all (other) lands as
\par innoxious divinities, scorching Africa render deadly with
\par wings ; you move the air on high, and following whole herds,
\par you burst asunder vast bulls, embracing them with your
\par folds. Nor is the elephant safe through his size ; everything
\par you devote to death, and no need have you of venom for a
\par deadly fate." Whereas the dragon referred to by Pliny
\par (vide ante, p. 169), as also combating the elephant, is evidently
\par without wings, and may either have been a very
\par gigantic serpent, or a lacertian corresponding to the Chinese
\par idea of the dragon.
\par Descending to later periods, we learn from Marcellinusf
\par that in his day dragon standards were among the chief
\par insignia of the Koman army ; for, speaking of the triumphal
\par entry of Constantine into Rome after his triumph over Magnentius,
\par he mentions that numbers of the chief officers who

\par various points of tissue, fastened to the golden or jewelled
\par points of spears ; the mouths of the dragons being open so
\par as to catch the wind, which made them hiss as though they

\par of the dragons and standards, and so assuming the title of
\par Emperor.
\par Several nations, as the Persians, Parthians, Scythians,
\par &c., bore dragons on their standards : whence the standards
\par themselves were called dracones or dragons.
\par It is probable that the Eomans borrowed this custom from
\par the Parthians, or, as Casaubon has it, from the Dacae, or
\par Codin, from the Assyrians ; but while the Roman dracones
\par were, as we learn from Ammianus Marcellinus, figures of
\par dragons painted in red on their flags, among the Persians
\par and Parthians they were, like the Roman eagles, figures in
\par relievo, so that the Romans were frequently deceived and
\par took them for real dragons.
\par The dragon plays an important part in Celtic mythology.
\par Among the Celts, as with the Romans, it was the national
\par standard.
\par While Cymri's dragon, from the Roman's hold
\par Spread with calm wing o'er Carduel's domes of gold.*
\par The fables of Merllin, Nennius, and Greoffry describe it as
\par red in colour, and so differing from the Saxon dragon which
\par was white. The hero Arthur carried a dragon on his helm,
\par and the tradition of it is moulded into imperishable form in
\par the Faerie Queen. A. dragon infested Lludd's dominion, and
\par made every heath in England resound with shrieks on each
\par May-day eve. A dragon of vast size and pestiferous breath
\par lay hidden in a cavern in Wales, and destroyed two districts
\par with its venom, before the holy St. Samson seized and threw
\par it into the sea.
\par In Celtic chivalry, the word dragon came to be used for
\par chief, a Pendragon being a sort of dictator created in times
\par of danger ;"and as the knights who slew a chief in battle
\par were said to slay a dragon, this doubtless helped to keep
\par alive the popular tradition regarding the monster which had
\par * Lord Lytton, King Arthur, Book i. Stanza 4.

\par been carried with them westward in their migration from
\par the common Aryan centre.
\par The Teutonic tribes who invaded and settled in England
\par bore the effigies of dragons on their shields and banners, and
\par these were also depicted on the ensigns of various German
\par tribes.* We also find that Thor himself was a slayer of \\
\par dragons, f and both Siegfried and Beowulf were similarly
\par engaged in the Niebelungen-lied and the epic bearing the
\par name of the latter. J The Berserkers not only named their
\par boats after the dragon, but also had the prow ornamented
\par with a dragon figure-head ; a fashion which obtains to the
\par present day among the Chinese, who have an annual dragonboat
\par festival, in which long snaky boats with a ferocious dragon
\par prow run races for prizes, and paddle in processions.
\par So deeply associated was the dragon with the popular
\par legends, that we find stories of encounters with it passing
\par down into the literature of the Middle Ages ; and, like the
\par heroes of old, the Christian saints won their principal renown
\par by dragon achievements. Thus among the dragon-slayers
\par we find that
\par 1. St. Phillip the Apostle destroyed a huge dragon at
\par Hierapolis in Phrygia.
\par 2. St. Martha killed the terrible dragon called Tarasque
\par at Aix (la Chapelle).

\par Moreover, the fossil remains of animals discovered from
\par time to time, and now relegated to their true position in the
\par zoological series, were supposed to be the genuine remains
\par of either dragons or giants, according to the bent of the
\par mind of the individual who stumbled on them : much as in

\par The annexed wood-cut of the skeleton of an Iguanodon,
\par found in a coal-mine at Bernissant, exactly illustrates the
\par semi-erect position which the dragon of fable is reported to
\par have assumed.
\par Among the latest surviving beliefs of this nature may be
\par cited the dragon of Wantley (Wharncliffe, Yorkshire), who
\par was slain by More of More Hall. He procured a suit of
\par armour studded with spikes, and, proceeding to the well
\par where the dragon had his lair, kicked him in the mouth,
\par where alone he was vulnerable. The Lambton worm is
\par another instance.
\par The explanations of these legends attempted by mythologists,
\par based on the supposition that the dragons which are
\par their subjects are simply symbolic of natural phenomena, are
\par ingenious, and perhaps in many instances sufficient, but do
\par not affect, as I have before remarked, the primitive and conserved
\par belief in their previous existence as a reality.
\par Thus, the author of British Goblins suggests that for the
\par prototype of the red dragon, which haunted caverns and
\par guarded treasures in Wales, we must look in the lightning
\par caverns of old Aryan fable, and deduces the fire-darting
\par dragons of modern lore from the shining hammer of Thor,
\par and the lightning spear of Odin.
\par The stories of ladies guarded by dragons are explained
\par on the supposition* that the ladies were kept in the secured
\par part of the feudal castles, round which the walls wound, and
\par that an adventurer had to scale the walls to gain access to
\par the ladies; when there were two walls, the authors of
\par romance said that the assaulter overcame two dragons, and
\par so on. St. Bomain, when he delivered the city of Rouen
\par from a dragon which lived in the river Seine, simply pro-

\par tected the city from an overflow, just as Apollo (the sun) is
\par symbolically said to have destroyed the serpent Python, or,
\par in other words, dried up an overflow. And the dragon of
\par Wantley is supposed by Dr. Percy to have been an overgrown
\par rascally attorney, who cheated some children of their
\par estates, but was compelled to disgorge by a gentleman
\par named More, who went against him armed with the "
\par spikes
\par of the law," whereupon the attorney died of vexation.
\par Furthermore, our dragoons were so denominated because
\par they were armed with dragons, that is, with short muskets,
\par which spouted fire like dragons, and had the head of a
\par dragon wrought upon their muzzle.
\par This fanciful device occurs also among the Chinese, for a
\par Jesuit, who accompanied the Emperor of China on a journey
\par into Western Tartary in 1683, says,
\par " This was the reason
\par of his coming into their country with so great an army, and
\par such vast military preparations; he having commanded several
\par pieces of cannon to be brought, in order for them to be discharged
\par from time to time in the valleys ; purposely that the
\par noise and fire, issuing from the mouths of the dragons, with
\par which they were adorned, might spread terror around."
\par Though dragons have completely dropped out of all
\par modern works on natural history, they were still retained and
\par regarded as quite orthodox until a little before the time of
\par Cuvier; specimens, doubtless fabricated like the ingeniously
\par constructed mermaid of Mr. Barnum, were exhibited in the

\par through time and nations until they had found a home
\par in people so remote from their starting point as to cause a

\par which he professes to have received in the year 1551, of a
\par true dried ^Ethiopian dragon.
\par He describes it as having two feet armed with claws, and
\par two ears, with five prominent and conspicuous tubercles on
\par the back. The whole was ornamented with green and dusky
\par scales, Above, it bore wings fit for flight, and had a long and
\par flexible tail, coloured with yellowish scales, such as shone on
\par the belly and throat. The mouth was provided with sharp
\par teeth, the inferior part of the head, towards the ears, was
\par even, the pupil of the eye black, with a tawny surrounding,
\par and the nostrils were two in number, and open.
\par He criticises Ammianus Marcellinus for his disbelief in
\par winged dragons, and states in further justification of his
\par censure that he had heard, from men worthy of confidence,
\par that in that portion of Pistorian territory called Cotone, a
\par great dragon was seen whose wings were interwoven with
\par sinews a cubit in length, and were of considerable width ;
\par this beast also possessed two short feet provided with claws
\par like those of an eagle. The whole animal was covered with
\par scales. The gaping mouth was furnished with big teeth, it
\par had ears, and was as big as a hairy bear. Aldrovandus
\par sustains his argument by quotations from the classics and
\par reference to more recent authors. He quotes Isidorus as
\par stating that the winged Arabian serpents were called Sirens,
\par while their venom was so effective that their bite was attended
\par by death rather than pain; this confirms the account of
\par Solinus.
\par He instances Gesner as saying that, in 1543, he understood
\par that a kind of dragon appeared near Styria, within the
\par confines of Germany, which had feet like lizards, and wings
\par after the fashion of a bat, with an incurable bite, and says
\par these statements are confirmed by Froschonerus in his work
\par on Styria (idque Froschonerus ex Bibliophila Stirio narrabat).
\par He classes dragons (which he considers as essentially winged
\par animals) either as footless or possessing two or four feet.
\par 204 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par He refers to a description by Scaliger* of a species of
\par serpent four feet long, and as thick as a man's arm, with
\par cartilaginous wings pendent from the sides. He also mentions
\par an account by Brodeus, of a winged dragon which was
\par brought to Francis, the invincible King of the Gauls, by a
\par countryman who had killed it with a mattock near Sanetones,
\par and which was stated to have been seen by many men
\par of approved reputation, who thought it had migrated from
\par transmarine regions by the assistance of the wind.
\par Cardanf states that whilst he resided in Paris he saw five
\par winged dragons in the William Museum ; these were biped,
\par and possessed of wings so slender that it was hardly possible
\par that they could fly with them. Cardan doubted their
\par having been fabricated, since they had been sent in vessels
\par at different times, and yet all presented the same remarkable
\par form. Bellonius states that he had seen whole carcases
\par of winged dragons, carefully prepared, which he considered
\par to be of the same kind as those which fly out of Arabia
\par into Egypt ; they were thick about the belly, had two feet,
\par and two wings, whole like those of a bat, and a snake's
\par tail.
\par It would be useless to multiply examples of the stories, no

\par known, are probably fair samples of the whole. It is
\par amusing to find the story of Sindbad's escape from the Valley

\par with a substitution of the dragon for the roc. Athanasius

\par more tender than their reputation. Unharmed by them he
\par remained for the six winter months, without any other sustenance
\par than that which he derived from licking the moisture
\par off the rock, in which he followed their example. Noticing
\par the dragons preparing for flying out on the approach of
\par spring, by stretching and unfolding their wings, he attached
\par himself by his girdle to the tail of one of them, and so was
\par restored to the upper world, where, unfortunately, the return
\par to the diet to which he had been so long unaccustomed
\par killed him. In memory, however, of the event, he left his
\par goods to the Church, and a monument illustrative of his
\par escape was erected in the Ecclesiastical College of St. Leodegaris
\par at Lucerne. Kircher had himself seen this, and it
\par was accepted as an irrefragable proof of the story.
\par Another story is an account also given by A. Kircher,* of
\par the fight between a dragon and a knight named Grozione, in
\par the island of Rhodes, in the year 1349 A.D. This monster
\par is described as of the bulk of a horse or ox, with a long neck
\par and serpent's head tipped with mule's ears the mouth
\par widely gaping and furnished with sharp teeth, eyes sparkling
\par as though they flashed fire, four feet provided with claws
\par like a bear, and a tail like a crocodile, the whole body being
\par coated with hard scales. It had two wings, blue above, but
\par blood-coloured and yellow underneath ; it was swifter
\par than a horse, progressing partly by flight and partly by
\par running. The knight, being solicited by the chief magistrate,
\par retired into the country, when he constructed an imitation
\par dragon of paper and tow, and purchased a charger and
\par two courageous English dogs ; he ordered slaves to snap the
\par jaws and twist the tail about by means of cords, while he
\par urged his horse and dogs on to the attack. After practising
\par for two months, these latter could scarcely retain their frenzy
\par at the mere sight of the image. He then proceeded to

\par the event of his being slain. Entering the lair he excited

\par Kircher had a very pious belief in dragons. He says :
\par " Since monstrous animals of this kind for the most part
\par select their lairs and breeding-places in subterraneous caverns.
\par I have considered it proper to include them under the head
\par of subterraneous beasts. I am aware that two kinds of this
\par animal have been distinguished by authors, the one with, the
\par other without, wings. No one either can or ought to doubt
\par concerning the latter kind of creature, unless perchance he

\par impious thing to say it when Daniel makes mention of the

\par of a serpent thirty cubits (say forty-five feet) in length, which
\par was captured alive by stratagem, the first attempt by force
\par having resulted in the death of several of the party. This
\par was conveyed to Ptolemy II. at Alexandria, where it was
\par placed in a den or chamber suitable for exhibition, and
\par became an object of general admiration. Diodorus says :
\par " When, therefore, so enormous a serpent was open for all to
\par see, credence could no longer be refused the Ethiopians, or
\par their statements be received as fables ; for they say that they
\par have seen in their country serpents so vast that they can not
\par only swallow cattle and other beasts of the same size, but
\par that they also fight with the elephant, embracing his limbs
\par so tightly in the fold of their coils that he is unable to move,
\par and, raising their neck up underneath his trunk, direct their
\par head against the elephant's eyes ; having destroyed his sight
\par by fiery rays like lightning, they dash him to the ground,
\par and, having done so, tear him to pieces."
\par In an account of the castle of Fahender, formerly one of
\par the most considerable castles of Fars, it is stated " Such is
\par the historical foundation of an opinion generally prevalent,
\par that the subterranean recesses of this deserted edifice are
\par still replete with riches. The talisman has not been forgotten
\par ; and tradition adds another guardian to the previous
\par deposit, a dragon or winged serpent ; this sits for ever
\par brooding over the treasure which it cannot enjoy,"

\par I shall examine, on a future occasion, how far those
\par figures correspond to the Persian ideas of dragons and serpents,
\par the azhdaha ((&A')\\ = dragon) and mar (;U = snake),
\par which, as various poets relate, are constant guardians of
\par every subterraneous ganj (^S = treasure).
\par The mar at least may be supposed the same as that
\par serpent which guards the golden fruit in the garden of the

\par CHAPTER VII.
\par THE CHINESE DRAGON.
\par WE now approach the consideration of a country in which
\par the belief in the existence of the dragon is thoroughly
\par woven into the life of the whole nation. Yet at the same
\par time it has developed into such a medley of mythology and
\par superstition as to materially strengthen our conviction of the
\par reality of the basis upon which the belief has been founded,
\par though it involves us in a mass of intricate perplexities in
\par connection with the determination of its actual period of
\par existence.
\par There is no country so conservative as China, no nation
\par which can boast of such high antiquity, as a collective people
\par permanently occupying the same regions, and preserving
\par records of their polity, manners, and surroundings from the
\par earliest date of their occupation of the territory which still
\par remains the centre of their civilization ; and there is none in
\par which dragon culture has been more persistently maintained
\par down to the present day.
\par Its mythologies, histories, religions, popular stories, and
\par proverbs, all teem with references to a mysterious being who
\par has a physical nature and spiritual attributes. Gifted with
\par an accepted form, which he has the supernatural power of
\par casting off for the assumption of others, he has the power
\par of influencing the weather, producing droughts or fertilizing
\par THE CHINESE DRAGON. 213
\par rains at pleasure, of raising tempests and allaying them.
\par Volumes could be compiled from the scattered legends which
\par everywhere abound relating to this subject ; but as they are,
\par for the most part, like our medieval legends, echoes of each
\par other, no useful purpose would be served by doing so, and I
\par therefore content myself with drawing, somewhat copiously,
\par from one or two of the chief sources of information.
\par As, however, Chinese literature is but little known or
\par valued in England, it is desirable that I should devote some
\par space to the consideration of the authority which may be
\par fairly claimed for the several works from which I shall make
\par quotations, bearing on the Chinese testimony of the past
\par existence, and date of existence, of the dragon and other
\par so-called mythical animals.
\par Incidental comments on natural history form a usual part
\par of every Chinese geographical work, but collective descriptions
\par of animals are rare in the literature of the present, and
\par almost unique in that of the past. We are, therefore, forced
\par to rely on the side-lights occasionally afforded by the older
\par classics, and on one or two works of more than doubtful
\par authenticity which claim, equally with them, to be of high
\par antiquity. The works to which I propose to refer more
\par immediately are the Yih King, the Bamboo Books, the Shu
\par King, the 'Eh Ya, the Shan Hai King, the Pan Ts'ao Kang
\par Muh, and the Yuen Kien Lei Han.
\par As it is well known that all the ancient books, with the
\par exception of those on medicine, divination, and husbandry,
\par were ordered to be destroyed in the year B.C. 212 by the
\par Emperor Tsin Shi Hwang Ti, under the threatened penalty
\par for non-compliance of branding and labour on the walls for
\par four years, and that a persecution of the literati was commenced
\par by him in the succeeding year, which resulted in the
\par burying alive in pits of four hundred and sixty of their
\par number, it may be reasonably objected that the claims to
\par high antiquity which some of the Chinese classics put forth,
\par 214 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par are, to say the least, doubtful, and, in some instances, highly
\par improbable.
\par This question has been well considered by Mr. Legge in
\par his valuable translation of the Chinese Classics. He points
\par out that the tyrant died within three years after the burning
\par of the books, and that the Han dynasty was founded only
\par eleven years after that date, in B.C. 201, shortly after which
\par attempts were commenced to recover the ancient literature.
\par He concludes that vigorous efforts to carry out the edict
\par would not be continued longer than the life of its authorthat
\par is, not for more than three years and that the materials
\par from which the classics, as they come down to us, were compiled
\par and edited in the two centuries preceding the Christian
\par era, were genuine remains, going back to a still more remote
\par period.
\par THE " Ym KING " OB YH KING."
\par The Yih King is one of those books specially excepted from
\par the general destruction of the books. Keferences in it to
\par the dragon are not numerous, and will be found as quotations
\par in the extracts from the large encyclopedia Yuen
\par Kien Lei Han, given hereafter. This work has hitherto
\par been very imperfectly understood even by the Chinese
\par themselves, but the recent researches of M. Terrien de la
\par Couperie lead us to suppose that our translations have
\par been imperfect, from the fact that many symbols have
\par different significations in the present day to those which
\par they had in very ancient times, and that a special dictionary
\par of archaic meanings must be prepared before an
\par accurate translation can be arrived at, a consummation
\par which may shortly be expected from his labours. I
\par find in my notes, taken from the manuscript of a lecture
\par given before the Ningpo Book Club in 1870, by the Eev. J.
\par Butler, of the Presbyterian Mission, that " the way in which
\par the dragon came to represent the Emperor and the Throne
\par THE CHINESE DRAGON. 215
\par of China* is accounted for in the Yih King as follows :
\par The chief dragon has his abode in the sky, and all clouds
\par and vapours, winds and rains are under his control. He
\par can send rain or withhold it at his pleasure, and hence all
\par vegetable life is dependent on him. So the Emperor, from
\par his exalted throne, watches over the interests of his people,
\par and confers on them those temporal and spiritual blessings
\par without which they would perish." I abstain from dwelling
\par on this or any other passages in the Yih King, pending the
\par translation promised by M. De la Couperie, the nature of
\par whose views on it are condensed in the notef attached, being
\par extracts from his papers on the subject.
\par * In China the dragon is peculiarly the emblem of imperial power,
\par as with us the lion is of the kingly. The Emperor is said to be seated
\par on the dragon throne. A five-clawed dragon is embroidered on the
\par Emperor's court-robes. It often surrounds his edicts, and the titlepages
\par of books published by his authority, and dragons are inscribed
\par on his banners. It is drawn stretched out at full length or curled up
\par with two legs pointing forwards and two backwards ; sometimes holding
\par a pearl in one hand, and surrounded by clouds and fire.
\par f The Yih King extracts from papers by Monsieur De la Couperie,
\par in the Journal of the Eoyal Asiatic Society.
\par " The Yih King is the oldest of the Chinese books, and is the
\par mysterious classic which requires
\par ' a prolonged attention to make it reveal
\par its secrets
\par '
\par ; it has peculiarities of style, making it the most difficult of
\par all the Chinese classics to present in an intelligible version."
\par " We have multifarious proofs that the writing, first known in China,
\par was already an old one, partially decayed, but also much improved since
\par its primitive hieroglyphic stage. We have convincing proofs (vide my
\par '
\par Early History of Chinese Civilization,' pp. 21-23, and the last section
\par of the present paper) that it had been borrowed, by the early leaders of
\par the Chinese Bak families [Poh Sing] in Western Asia, from an horizontal
\par writing traced from left to right, the pre-cuneiform character,
\par which previously had itself undergone several important modifications.
\par "At that time the Ku-wen was really the phonetic expression of
\par speech. (By an analysis of the old inscriptions and fragments, and by
\par the help of the native works on palaeography, some most valuable,

\par "This mysterious book is still avowedly not understood, and we
\par assist, now-a-days, at a most curious spectacle. There are not a few
\par Chinese of education among those who have picked up some knowledge
\par in Europe or in translations of European works of our modern sciences,
\par who believe openly that all these may be found in their Yih. Electricity,
\par steam power, astronomical laws, sphericity of the earth, &c., are all,
\par according to their views, to be found in the Yih King ; they firmly
\par believe that these discoveries were not ignored by their sages, who have
\par embodied them in their mysterious classics, of which they will be able
\par to unveil the secrets when they themselves apply to its study a thorough
\par knowledge of the modern sciences. It is unnecessary for any European
\par mind to insist upon the childishness of such an opinion. Even in
\par admitting, what seems probable, that the early leaders of the Bak people
\par (Poh Sing) were not without some astronomical and mathematical
\par principles, which have been long since forgotten, there is no possible
\par comparison between their rude notions and our sciences.

\par orthography had led me, several years ago, to no other conclusion than
\par that (as the reverse is proved impossible by numerous reasons), at an
\par early period of their history, and before their emigration to the far
\par East, the Chinese Bak families had borrowed the pre-cuneiform writing
\par and elements of their knowledge and institutions from a region connected
\par with the old focus of culture of south-western Asia.
\par " Numerous affinities of traditions, institutions, and customs, connect
\par the borrowing of script and culture by the Chinese Bak families with
\par the region of Elam, the confederation of states of which Susa was the

\par discovery, as related in the history of the Emperor Woo, the
\par first of the sovereigns of Tsin, as follows :
\par " In the fifth year of his reign, under title of Heen-ning*
\par [=A.D. 2791, some lawless parties, in the department of
\par Keih, dug open the grave of King Seang of Wei [died
\par B.C. 295] and found a number of bamboo tablets, written
\par over, in the small seal character, with more than one hundred
\par thousand words, which were deposited in the imperial
\par library."
\par Mr. Legge adds,
\par " The Emperor referred them to the
\par principal scholars in the service of the Government, to adjust
\par the tables in order, having first transcribed them in modern
\par characters. Among them were a copy of the Yih King, in
\par two books, agreeing with that generally received, and a book
\par of annals, in twelve or thirteen chapters, beginning with the
\par reign of Hwang-te, and coming down to the sixteenth year
\par of the last emperor of the Chow dynasty, B.C. 298."
\par " The reader will be conscious of a disposition to reject at
\par once the account of the discovery of the Bamboo Books.
\par He has read so much of the recovery of portions of the
\par Shoo from the walls of houses that he must be tired of this

\par the Chinese invaders, Bak and Kutti or Kutta, are not altogether
\par foreign to those regions. The Chinese Kutti and the Kussi, the Chinese
\par Bak and Bakh, the ethnic of Bakhdi (Bactria), will be, most likely, one
\par day proved to be the same ethnic names. Had not the Chinese, previous
\par to my researches, and quite on different reasons, been traced back

\par laid in it had mingled with the dust. From the death of

\par Against this, however, which is not a very weighty objection,
\par if we consider the length of time that Egyptian papyri
\par have been entombed before their restoration to the light,
\par Mr. Legge ranges preponderating evidence in favour of their
\par authenticity, and concludes that "
\par they had, no doubt, been
\par lying for nearly six centuries in the tomb in which they had
\par been first deposited when they were then brought anew to
\par light."
\par The annals consist of two portions, one forming what is
\par undoubtedly the original text, and consisting of short notices
\par of occurrences, such as,
\par " In his fiftieth year, in the
\par autumn, in the seventh month, on the day Kang shin [fiftyseventh
\par of cycle] phoenixes, male and female, arrived," &c.
\par &c. It also records earthquakes, obituaries, accessions, and
\par remarkable natural phenomena. The other portion is interspersed
\par between these, in the form of rather diffuse, though
\par not very numerous, notes, which by some are supposed to be
\par a portion of the original text, by others, to have been added
\par by the commentator Shin Yo [A.D. 502-557].
\par In the latter, frequent references are made to the appearance
\par of phoenixes (the funy wang). ki-lins (unicorns), and
\par dragons.
\par In the former we find only incidental references to either
\par of these, such as,
\par " XIV. The Emperor K'ung-kea. In
\par his first year (B.C. 1611), when he came to the throne, he
\par dwelt on the west of the Ho. He displaced the chief of
\par Ch'e-wei,* and appointed Lew-luyt to feed the dragons."

\par According to the latter, Hwang Ti (B.C. 2697) had a
\par dragon-like countenance ; while the mother of Yaou (B.C.
\par 2356) conceived him by a dragon. The legend is :
\par " After
\par she was grown up, whenever she looked into any of the three
\par Ho, there was a dragon following her. One morning the
\par dragon came with a picture and writing. The substance of
\par the writing was the Ked one has received the favour of
\par Heaven. . . . The red dragon made K'ing-teo pregnant."
\par Again, when Yaou had been on the throne seventy years,
\par a dragon-horse appeared bearing a scheme, which he laid on
\par the table and went away.
\par The Emperor Shun (B.C. 2255) is said to have had a
\par dragon countenance.
\par It is also said of Yu (the first emperor of the Hia dynasty)
\par that when the fortunes of Hia were about to rise, all vegetation
\par was luxuriant, and green dragons lay in the borders ;
\par and that " on his way to the south, when crossing the Kiang,
\par in the middle of the stream, two yellow dragons took the
\par boat on their backs. The people were all afraid ; but Yu
\par laughed, and said,
\par ' I received my appointment from Heaven,
\par and labour with all my strength to nourish men. To be
\par born is the course of nature ; to die is by Heaven's decree.
\par Why be troubled by the dragons ?
\par ' On this the dragons
\par went away, dragging their tails."
\par From these extracts it will be seen that the dragon,
\par although universally believed in, was already mythical and

\par It opens with the reign of Yaou (B.C. 2357), and contains
\par interesting details of the polity of those remote ages.
\par It contains a record of the great inundation occurring
\par during his reign, which Mr. Legge does not identify with the
\par Deluge of Genesis, but which Dr. Gutzlaff and other
\par missionary Sinologues consider to be the same.
\par It is interesting to find in this work, claiming so high an
\par antiquity, references to an antiquity which had preceded it
\par a bygone civilization, perhaps as follows, in the book called
\par Yih and Ts'ih.* The emperor (Shun, B.C. 2255 to 2205)
\par says,
\par " I wish to see the emblematic figures of the ancients
\par the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountain, the dragon,
\par and the flowery fowl, which are depicted on the upper garment ;
\par the temple cup, the aquatic grass, the flames, the grains of
\par rice, the hatchet, and the symbol of distinction, which are
\par embroidered on the lower garment. I wish to see all these displayed
\par with the five colours, so as to form the official robes ;
\par it is yours to adjust them clearly." Here the dragon is
\par chosen as an emblematic figure, in association with eleven
\par others, which are objects of every-day knowledge, and this,
\par I think, establishes a presumption that it itself was not at
\par that date considered an object of doubtful credibility.
\par Similarly, we find the twelve symbolical animals, representing
\par the twelve branches of the Horary characters
\par (dating, see Williams' Dictionary, from B.C. 2637), to be the
\par rat, the ox, tiger, hare, dragon, serpent, horse, sheep,
\par monkey, cock, dog, boar, where the dragon is the only one
\par about whose existence a question can be raised. From this
\par latter we learn that there was no confusion of meaning then between
\par dragons and serpents ; the distinction of the two creatures was
\par clearly recognized, just as it was many centuries afterwards
\par by Mencius (4th century B.C.), who, in writing of
\par these early periods, says,
\par " In the time of Yaou, the waters,

\par flowing out of their channels, inundated the Middle Kingdom.
\par Snakes and dragons occupied it, and the people had
\par no place where they could settle themselves

\par ; and again,
\par " Yu dug open their obstructed channels, and conducted
\par them to the sea. He drove away the snakes and dragons,*
\par and forced them into the grassy marshes."

\par and only fit to be relegated to the domain of Jack the Giant
\par Killer and other childish stories. After a close examination
\par of the book, I apprehend that this view of it can hardly
\par be maintained. That such stories or descriptions are interspersed
\par throughout the work is not to be disputed ; but a
\par large proportion of it consists of apparently authentic geographical
\par records, including, as is customary with all works
\par of a similar nature in China, descriptions of the most remarkable
\par objects of natural history occurring in the different
\par regions. I think it will be found possible to identify many
\par of these at the present day, some may be conjectured at,
\par and the residue are not more numerous in proportion than
\par the similar fables or perverted accounts which figure in the
\par western classic volumes of Ctesias, Aristotle, Pliny, and
\par even much later writers. So far as the supernatural portions
\par are concerned, it must be remembered that, even so late as
\par the days of the childhood of Sir Humphrey Davy, pixies were
\par still supposed by the lower classes to trace the fairy rings in
\par Cornwall; that quite lately, and perhaps among certain
\par classes to the present day, the existence of the banshee in
\par Ireland, of the kelpie in Scotland, and of persons gifted with
\par the mysterious and awe-inspiring power of second sight,

\par was religiously believed in. There are few important
\par houses in England whose ancestral walls have not concealed
\par an apparition connected with the destinies of the family,
\par appearing only on fatal or eventful occasions ; and in the
\par days of the sapient James I. in England, and among the
\par Pilgrim Fathers in the American States, the existence
\par of wizards and witches was universally accepted as an
\par undeniable fact, proved by hundreds of instances of extorted
\par or voluntary confession, and supplemented by the
\par concurrent testimony of a still greater number of witnesses
\par who genuinely believed themselves to have been the spectators
\par or victims of the supernatural powers of the accused.
\par An historian of these later times might well have described
\par such things as realities, and we should not be disposed, on
\par account of his having done so, to question the validity of his
\par description of other objects or creatures existing at the
\par period, presuming them to be more consistent with our
\par present notions of possibility.
\par No one, now-a-days, would discredit the veracity of Marco
\par Polo because he speaks of enormous serpents in Carajan,
\par possessing two feet, each armed with a single claw. That
\par there was a solid foundation for his story is admitted, and
\par commentators are only at variance as to whether the basis
\par was a large species of python, such as still exists in Southern
\par China, or a gigantic alligator, of which he might have seen
\par a mutilated specimen.
\par It must also be borne in mind that the existence of some
\par gigantic saurian, now extinct, possessing two limbs only, in
\par place of four, is not an impossibility ; as the small lizard,
\par Chirotes, is in that condition, and also the North American
\par genus Siren, belonging to the Newts.
\par I notice that Ketzoch, in his designs to illustrate Schiller's
\par poem,
\par " The Fight with the Dragon,'* makes the monster
\par have only two fore-legs, and this appears to have been a

\par As to the mysterious powers imputed throughout the Shan

\par (for example) the hippopotamus, to a river-horse, of the
\par pipe-fish, known as the hippocampus, to a sea-horse ; of the
\par manatee to a merman, and the like ?
\par And, lastly, are the composite creatures, partly bird and
\par partly reptilian, occasionally referred to, so entirely incredible
\par ? Is it not barely possible that some of those intervening
\par types which we know from the teaching of Darwin,
\par must have existed ; which we know, from the researches of
\par paleontology have existed ; types intermediate to the StruthionidcB,
\par the most reptilian of birds, and the Chlamydce, the
\par most avian of reptiles is it not possible that some of these
\par may have continued their existence down to a late date, and

\par that the tradition of these existing as the descendants or the

\par impossible? Do not the Trigonias, the Terebratulas, the
\par Marsupials, and, in part, the vegetation of Australia, form
\par the spare surviving descendants of the forms which characterised
\par the oolitic period on our own shores ? Why, then,
\par may not a few cretaceous and early tertiary forms have

\par After long, repeated, and careful examination of the Shan
\par Hai King, I arrive at a very different conclusion from M.
\par Bazin. I hold it to be an authentic and precious memorial
\par which has been handed down to us from remote antiquity,
\par the value of which has been unrecognised owing to the book
\par being unfortunately a fusion of two and perhaps three distinct
\par works.
\par FIG. 54. THE PA XAKE. (From the Shan Hai King.)
\par 236 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par The oldest was the Shan King, and consists of five volumes,
\par devoted respectively to the northern, southern, eastern,
\par western, and central mountain ranges. This is devoid of all
\par reference to persons and habited places. It is simply an
\par abstract of the results of a topographical survey which may
\par not impossibly have been, as it claims, the one conducted
\par by Yii.
\par It contains lists of mountains and rivers, with valuable
\par notes on their mineral productions, fauna and flora. It also
\par gives lists of the divinities controlling or belonging to each
\par mountain range, and the sacrifices suitable to them. There
\par are few extravagances in this portion of the work.
\par The remainder is devoted to a history of the regions
\par without and within the four hai or seas bounding the empire,
\par and those constituting what is called the Great Desert.
\par Here extravagant stories, myths, accounts of wonderful
\par people, references to states, cities, and tribes are mingled
\par with geographical notices which, from their repetition, show
\par that this portion is itself resolvable into two distinct works
\par of more modern date, whose origin was probably posterior to
\par the wave of Taouist superstition which swept over China in
\par the first six centuries of our era. I must add that the term,
\par " within the four seas
\par "
\par does not imply the arrogant belief,
\par as is generally supposed, that this Empire extended to the
\par ocean on every side, the archaic meaning being the very
\par different one of frontier or boundary region ; while the word
\par " desert
\par "
\par has a similar signification.
\par In that more credible portion of the work which I believe
\par to have been the original Shan King, references to dragons
\par are infrequent. In some instances the Mao (which I interpret
\par as the gavial) is specifically referred to ; in others the
\par word lung is used ; thus, it speaks of dragons and turtles
\par abounding in the Ti River, flowing from one of the northern
\par mountains east of the Ho. From the context, however, an
\par aquatic creature, and probably an alligator, is indicated.

\par From the entire text I gather that the true terrestrial dragon
\par was not an inmate of China, at all events after the period ol
\par Yii. I further infer that it was a feared and much respected
\par denizen of the more or less arid highlands, whence the early
\par Chinese either migrated or were driven, and from which
\par point the dragon traditions flowed pretty evenly east and
\par west, beat against the Himalayan chain on the south, and
\par only penetrated India in a later and modified form.
\par There is a short reference to the Ying Lung or winged
\par dragon ; it is as follows :
\par " In the north-east corner of the Great Desert are mountains
\par called Hiung-li and T'u K'iu. The Ying Lung lives at
\par the south extremity.
\par "
\par [Commentary. The Ying Lung is a dragon with wings.]
\par " He killed Tsz Yiu and Kwa Fu.
\par "
\par [Commentary. Tsz Yiu was a soldier.]
\par " He could not ascend to heaven.
\par "
\par [Commentary. The Ying Lung dwells beneath the earth.]
\par " So there is often drought.
\par "
\par [Commentary. Because no rain was made above.]
\par " When there is a drought, the form of the Ying dragon is
\par made, and then there is much rain.
\par "
\par [Commentary. Now the false dragon is for this purpose, to influence
\par (the heaven) ; men are not able to do it.]"
\par The better printed copies of this work are illustrated with
\par a very truculent- looking dragon with outspread wings. A
\par stone delineation of a dragon with wings forms the ornamentation
\par of the bridge at Nincheang Foo. In the interior
\par of China, it was observed by Mr. Cooper, and is given in his
\par Travels of a Pioneer of Commerce. These are the only cases
\par in China in which I have come across illustrations of
\par dragons with genuine wings. As a rule, the dragon appears
\par to be represented as having the power of translating itself
\par without mechanical agency, sailing among the clouds, or
\par rising from the sea at pleasure.

\par The Shan Hai King contains valuable notices of winged
\par snakes and gigantic serpents, as, for example, the so-called
\par singing snakes. Speaking of the Sien mountain (one of the
\par Central Mountains), it says :
\par " Gold and jade abound. It is
\par barren. The Sien river issues and flows north into the I river.
\par On it are many singing snakes. They look like snakes, but
\par have four wings. Their voice is like the beating of stones.

\par The Pa snake, already spoken of, is described as capable of
\par gorging an elephant. The Ta Hien mountains were reputed
\par uninhabitable on account of the presence of gigantic serpents
\par (pythons ?), which were said to have been of the
\par colour of mugwort, to have possessed hairs like pig's bristles
\par projecting between the lines of their riband-like markings.
\par Rumour had magnified their length to one hundred fathoms,
\par and they made a noise like the beating of a drum or the
\par striking of a watchman's wooden clapper. The Siong Jan

\par overhung in three layers.

\par by Li Shechin, of the Ming dynasty (probably born
\par early in the sixteenth century A.D.). It was first printed in
\par the Wan-leih period (1573 to 1620). I give its article
\par upon the dragon in extenso.
\par "
\par According to the dictionary of Hii Shan, the character
\par lung in the antique form of writing represents the shape of
\par the animal. According to the Shang Siao Lun, the dragon is
\par deaf, hence its name of lung (deaf). In Western books the
\par dragon is called nake (naga). Shi-Chan says that in the
\par 'Rh Ya Yih of Lo-Yuen the dragon is described as the largest
\par of scaled animals (literally, insects). Wang Fu says that
\par the dragon has nine (characteristics) resemblances. Its head
\par is like a camel's, its horns like a deer's, its eyes like a
\par hare's,* its ears like a bull's, its neck like a snake's, its belly
\par like an iguanodon's (?), its scales like a carp's, its claws like
\par an eagle's, and its paws like a tiger's. Its scales number
\par eighty-one, being nine by nine, the extreme (odd or) lucky
\par number. Its voice resembles the beating of a gong. On
\par each side of its mouth are whiskers, under its chin is a
\par bright pearl, under its throat the scales are reversed, on the
\par top of its head is the poh shan, which others call the wooden
\par foot-rule. A dragon without a foot-rule cannot ascend the
\par skies. When its breath escapes it forms clouds, sometimes
\par changing into rain, at other times into fire. Luh Tien in
\par the P'i Ya remarks, when dragon -breath meets with damp it
\par becomes bright, when it gets wet it goes on fire. It is extinguished
\par by ordinary fire.
\par " The dragon comes from an egg, it being desirable to
\par keep it folded up. When the male calls out there is a breeze
\par above, when the female calls out there is a breeze below, in
\par * The character-for a hare is very like the character for a devil. The
\par Japanese, in quoting this passage, have fallen into this error.

\par consequence of which there is conception. The Shih Tien
\par states, when the dragons come together they are changed
\par into two small serpents. In the Siao Shwoh it is said that
\par the disposition of the dragon is very fierce, and it is fond of
\par beautiful gems and jade (?). It is extremely fond of swallow's
\par flesh ; it dreads iron, the mong plant, the centipede, the
\par leaves of the Pride of India, and silk dyed of different (five)
\par colours. A man, therefore, who eats swallow's flesh should
\par fear to cross the water. When rain is wanted a swallow
\par should be offered (used); when floods are to be restrained,
\par then iron ; to stir up the dragon, the mong plant should be
\par employed ; to sacrifice to Kuh Yuen, the leaves of the Pride
\par of India bound with coloured silk should be used (see
\par Mayers, p. 107, 326) and thrown into the river. Physicians
\par who use dragons' bones ought to know the likes and
\par dislikes of dragons as given above."
\par "
\par Dragons
\par 1 Bones.* In the Pieh luh it is said that these
\par are found in the watercourses in Tsin (Southern Shansi)
\par and in the earth-holes which exist along the banks of the
\par streams running in the caves of the T'ai Shan (Great Hill),
\par Shantung. For seeking dead dragons' graves there is no
\par fixed time. Hung King says that now they are largely
\par found in Leung-yih (in Shansi ?) and Pa-chung (in Szchuen).
\par Of all the bones, dragon's spine is the best; the
\par brains make the white earth strice, which when applied to the
\par tongue is of great virtue. The small teeth are hard, and of
\par the usual appearance of teeth. The horns are hard and
\par solid. All the dragons cast off their bodies without really
\par dying. Han says the dragon-bones from Yea-cheu, Ts'ang-
\par * The dragons' bones sold by apothecaries in China consist of the
\par fossilized teeth and bones of a variety of species, generally in a fragmentary
\par condition. The white earth striae, or dragons' brains, here
\par referred to, are probably asbestos. The asbestos sold in Chefoo
\par market, under the name of Lung Ku or dragons' bones, is procured at
\par 0-tzu-kung.
\par THE CHINESE DRAGON. 245
\par cheu and T'ai-yuen (all in Shansi) are the best. The smaller
\par bones marked with wider lines are the female dragon's ; the
\par rougher bones with narrower lines are those of the male
\par dragon ; those which are marked with variegated colours are
\par esteemed the best. Those that are either yellow or white
\par are of medium value ; the black are inferior. If any of the
\par bones are impure, or are gathered by women, they should
\par not be used.
\par " P'u says dragons' bones of a light white colour possess
\par great virtue. Kung says the bones found in Tsin (South
\par Shansi) that are hard are not good ; the variegated ones
\par possess virtue. The light, the yellow, the flesh-coloured,
\par the white, and the black, are efficacious in curing diseases
\par in the internal organs having their respective colours, just as
\par the five varieties of the chi* plant, the five kinds of limestone,
\par and the five kinds of mineral oil (literally, fat), which
\par remain still for discussion in this work.
\par "
\par Su-chung states :
\par ' In the prefecture of Cheu kiiin, to the
\par " East of the River
\par "
\par (Shansi), dragons' bones are still found
\par in large quantities.
\par 5
\par "
\par Li-chao, in the Kwoh-shi-pu, says :
\par * In the spring floods
\par the fish leap into the Dragon's Gate, and the number of castoff
\par bones there is very numerous. These men seek for medicinal
\par purposes. They are of the five colours. This Dragon's
\par Gate is in Tsin (Shansi), where this work (Kwoh-shi-pu) is
\par published. Are not, then, these so-called dragons' bones
\par the bones of fish ?
\par '
\par "
\par Again, quoting from Sun Kwang-hien in the Poh-mung
\par Legends :
\par ' In the time of the five dynasties there was a contest
\par between two dragons; when one was slain, a village
\par hero, Kw'an, got both its horns. In the front of the horns
\par was an object of a bluish colour, marked with confused lines,
\par * The boletus, supposed to possess mystic efficacy.
\par 246 MYTHICAL MONSTE&S.
\par which no one knew anything about, as the dragon was completely
\par dead.'
\par "
\par Tsung Shih says :
\par < All statements [concerning dragons'
\par bones] disagree ; they are merely speculations, for when a
\par mountain cavern has disclosed to view a skeleton head, horns
\par and all, who is to know whether they are exuvice or that the
\par dragon has been killed ? Those who say they are exuvice, or
\par that the dragon is dead, then have the form of the animal,
\par but have never seen it alive. Now, how can one see the
\par thing (as it really is) when it is dead? Some also say
\par that it is a transformation, but how is it only in its appearance
\par that it cannot be transformed ?
\par '
\par "
\par Ki, in the present work, says that they are really dead
\par dragons' bones ; for one to say that they are exuvice is a
\par mere speculation.
\par " Shi Chan says :
\par < The present work considers that these
\par are really dead dragons' bones, but To Shi thinks they
\par are exuvice. Su and Kan doubt both these statements.
\par They submit that dragons are divine beings, and resemble
\par the principle of immortality (never-in-themselves-dying
\par principle) ; but there is the statement of the dragon fighting
\par and getting killed; and further, in the Tso-chw'en,
\par in which it is stated that there was a certain rearer of
\par dragons who pickled dragons for food [for the imperial
\par table?].'
\par " The I-ki says :
\par ' In the time of the Emperor Hwo, of the
\par Han dynasty, during a heavy shower a dragon fell in the
\par palace grounds, which the Emperor ordered to be made into
\par soup and given to his Ministers.'
\par " The Poh-wuh-chi states that a certain Chang Hwa '
\par got
\par dragon's flesh to dry, for it is said that when seasoning was
\par applied the five colours appeared, &c. These facts prove
\par that the dragon does die, an opinion which is considered
\par correct by [the writers of] the present work.'

\par THE JAPANESE DRAGON.
\par THERE is but little additional information as to the dragon
\par to be gained from Japan, the traditions relating to it in that
\par country having been obviously derived from China. In
\par functions and qualities it is always represented as identical
\par with the Chinese dragon. In Japan, however, it is invariably
\par figured as possessing three claws, whereas in China it
\par has four or five, according as it is an ordinary or an imperial
\par emblem. The peasantry are still influenced by a belief in its
\par supernatural powers, or in those of some large or multipleheaded
\par snake, supposed to be a transformation of it, and to
\par be the tenant of deep lakes or of springs issuing from
\par mountains.
\par 1 give, as examples of dragon stories, two selected from the
\par narratives of mythical history,* and one extracted from a
\par native journal of the day.
\par * The first two stories are from the Ko Ku Shi Riyah, a recent history
\par of Japan, from the earliest periods down to the present time, by
\par Matsunai, with a continuation by a later author. They are contained in
\par THE JAPANESE DRAGON. 249
\par The first states that " Hi-koho-ho-da-mi no mikoto (a
\par god) went out hunting, and his eldest brother Hono-sa-su-ri
\par no mikoto went out fishing. They were very successful, and
\par proposed to one another to change occupations. They
\par did so.
\par " Hono-sa-su-ri no mikoto went out to the mountain hunting,
\par but got nothing, therefore he gave back his bow and
\par arrow ; but Hi-ko-hoho-da-mi no mikoto lost his hook in the
\par sea ; he therefore tried to return a new one, but his brother
\par would not receive it, and wanted the old one ; and the
\par mikoto was greatly grieved, and, wandering on the shore,
\par met with an old man called Si-wo-tsu-chino-gi, and told him
\par what had happened.
\par " The latter made a cage called me-na-shi.kogo, enclosed
\par him in it, and sank it to the bottom of the sea. The
\par mikoto proceeded to the temple of the sea-god, who gave him
\par a girl, Toyotama, in marriage. He remained there three
\par years, and recovered the hook which he had lost, as well as
\par receiving two pieces of precious jade called * ebb ' and ' flood.'
\par He then returned. After some years he died. His son, Hiko-
\par na-gi-sa-ta-k'e-ouga-ya-fu-ki-aya-dzu no mikoto, succeeded
\par to the crown.
\par " When his father first proposed to return, his wife told
\par him that she was enciente, and that she would come out to
\par the shore during the rough weather and heavy sea, saying,
\par 1 1 hope you will wait until you have completed a house for
\par my confinement.' After some time Toyotama came there
\par and begged him never to come to her bed when she was
\par sleeping. He, however, crept up and peeped at her. He
\par saw a dragon holding a child in the midst of its coils.
\par It suddenly jumped up and darted into the sea."

\par item of news in the journal called the Chin-jei-Nippo, April 30th,
\par 1884.
\par 250 MYTHICAL
\par THE JAPANESE DRAGON. 251
\par The second legend is :
\par " When the So-sa-no-o no mikoto
\par went to the sources of the river Hi-no-ka-mi at Idzumo, he
\par heard lamentations from a house ; he therefore approached it
\par and inquired the cause. He saw an old man and woman clasping
\par a young girl. They told him that in that country there
\par was a very large serpent, which had eight* heads and eight
\par tails, and came annually and swallowed one person.
\par * We
\par had eight children, and we have already lost seven, and now
\par have only one left, who will be swallowed ; hence our grief.'
\par The mikoto said,
\par * If you will give that girl to me, I will
\par save her.' The old man and woman were rejoiced. The
\par mikoto changed his form, and assumed that of the young
\par girl. He divided the room into eight partitions, and
\par in each placed one saki tuh and waited its approach. The
\par serpent arrived, drank the saki, got intoxicated, and fell

\par " Then the mikoto drew his sword and cut the serpent into

\par the god 0-mi-ka-mi, at Taka-maga-hara.
\par 66 He called the sword Ama no mourakoumo no tsiirogi,f
\par because there was a cloud up in the heaven where the serpent

\par Ukisima. In the fine weather little waves rise up on account
\par of its size. There are many turtles in it. In the summertime
\par many boys go to the pond to swim, but never go out
\par into the middle or far from the shore. No one is aware how
\par deep the centre of the pond is, and it is said that a white
\par dragon lives in that pond, and can transform itself into a
\par bird, which the people of the district call 0-gon-cho, i.e.
\par golden bird, because, when it becomes a bird, it has a yellow
\par plumage. The bird flies once in fifty years, and its voice is
\par like the howling of a wolf. In that year there is famine and
\par pestilence, and many people die. Just one hundred years
\par ago, when this bird flew and uttered its cry, there was a
\par famine and drought and disease, and many people died.
\par Again, at Tempo-go-nen (i.e. in the fifth year of Tempo),
\par fifty years back from the present time, the bird flew as before,
\par and there was once again disease and famine. Hence the
\par people in that district were much alarmed, as it is now
\par just fifty years again. They hoped, however, that the bird
\par would not fly and cry. But at 2 A.M. of the 19th April it is
\par said that it was seen to do so. The people, therefore, were
\par surprised, and now are worshipping God in order to avert the
\par famine and disease. The old farmers say, in the fine weather
\par the white dragon may occasionally be seen floating on the
\par water, but that if it sees people it sinks down beneath the
\par surface." *
\par As a pendant to this I now quote a memorial from the
\par Pekin Gazette of April 3rd, 1884, of which a translation is
\par given in the North China Herald for May 16th, 1884.
\par " A Postscript Memorial of P'an Yii requests that an additional

\par They are supposed to be messengers from the gods, and are never

\par own hand, may be conferred on a dragon spirit, who has
\par manifested himself and answered the prayers made to
\par him.
\par 11 In the Ang-shan mountains, a hundred li from the town
\par of Kuei-hai, there are three wells, of which one is on the
\par mountain top, in a spot seldom visited. It has long been
\par handed down that a dragon inhabits this well. If pieces
\par of metal are thrown into the well they float, but light
\par things, as silk or paper, will sink. If the offerings are
\par accepted, fruits come floating up in exchange. Anything not
\par perfectly pure and clean is rejected and sent whirling up
\par again. The spirit dwells in the blackest depths of the water,
\par in form like a strange fish, with golden scales and four paws,
\par red eyes and long body. He ordinarily remains deep in
\par the water without stirring. But in times of great drought,
\par if the local authorities purify themselves, and sincerely worship
\par him, he rises to the top. He is then solemnly conveyed
\par to the city, and prayers for rain are offered to him, which
\par are immediately answered. His temple is in the district
\par city, on the To'ang-hai Ling. The provincial and local
\par histories record that tablets to him have been erected
\par from the times of the Mongol and the Ming dynasties.
\par During the present dynasty, on several occasions, as, for
\par instance, in the years 1845 and 18(53, he has been carried
\par into the city, and rain has fallen immediately. Last year a
\par dreadful drought occurred, in which the ponds and tanks
\par dried up, to the great terror of the people. On the 15th
\par day of the eighth month, the magistrate conducted the spirit
\par into the city, and, with the assembled multitude, prayed to
\par him fervently ; thereupon a gentle rain, falling throughout
\par the country, brought plenty in the place of scarcity, and
\par gladdened the hearts of all. At about the same time, the
\par people of a district in the vicinity, called Chin-yu, also had
\par recourse to the spirit, with equally favourable results. These
\par are well-known events, which have happened quite recently.
\par 254 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par " It is the desire of the people of the district that some
\par mark of distinction should be conferred on the spirit ; and
\par the memorialist finds such a proceeding to be sanctioned both
\par by law and precedent ; he therefore humbly lays the wishes
\par of the people before His Majesty, who, perhaps, will be
\par pleased to confer a title and an autograph tablet as above
\par suggested. The Rescript has already been recorded.

\par The idea of the transformation of a sea-monster or dragon
\par into a bird is common both to China and Japan ; for instance,
\par in The Works of Chuang Tsze, ch. i. p. 1, by F. H. Balfour,
\par F.B.G.S., we read that-
\par "In the Northern Sea there was a fish, whose name was
\par kw'en. It is not known how many thousand li this fish was
\par in length. It was afterwards transformed into a bird called
\par p'eng, the size of whose back is uncertain by some thousands
\par of li. Suddenly it would dart upwards with rapid flight, its
\par FiG.62. THE HAI Rjvo. (Chi-on-in Monastery, Kioto.)

\par wings overspreading the sky like clouds. When the waters
\par were agitated [in the sixth moon] the bird moved its abode
\par to the Southern Sea, the Pool of Heaven. In the book
\par called Ts'i Hieh, which treats of strange and marvellous
\par things, it is said that when the p'eng flew south, it first
\par rushed over three thousand li of water, and then mounted
\par to the height of ninety thousand li, riding upon the
\par wind that blows in the sixth moon. The wild horses, i.e.
\par the clouds and dust of heaven, were driven along by the
\par zephyrs. The colour of the sky was blue ; yet, is that the
\par real colour of the sky, or only the appearance produced by
\par infinite, illimitable depths ? For the bird, as it looked
\par downwards, the view was just the same as it is to us when
\par we look upwards."
\par On the screens decorating the Chi-on-in monastery in
\par Kioto, are depicted several composite creatures, half-dragon,
\par half-bird, which appear to represent the Japanese rendering
\par of the Chinese Ying Lung or winged dragon. They have
\par dragons' heads, plumose wings, and birds' claws, and have
\par been variously designated to me by Japanese as the Hai
\par Itiyo (Fig. 62), the Tobi Tatsu,, and the Schachi Hoko.

\par dragon ; that such being the case, it is more likely to have
\par once had a real existence than to be a mere offspring of
\par fancy ; and that from the accident of direct transmission of
\par delineations of it on robes and standards, we have probably
\par CONCLUSION OF DRAGON CHAPTERS. 259
\par a not very incorrect notion of it in the depicted dragon of the
\par Chinese.
\par We may infer that it was a long terrestrial lizard, hibernating,
\par and carnivorous, with the power of constricting
\par with its snake-like body and tail ; possibly furnished with
\par wing-like expansions of its integument, after the fashion of
\par Draco volans, and capable of occasional progress on its hind
\par legs alone, when excited in attack. It appears to have been
\par protected by armour and projecting spikes, like those found
\par in Moloch horridus and Megalania prisca, and was possibly
\par more nearly allied to this last form than to any other which
\par has yet come to our knowledge. Probably it preferred
\par sandy, open country to forest land, its habitat was the highlands
\par of Central Asia, and the time of its disappearance about
\par that of the Biblical Deluge discussed in a previous chapter.
\par Although terrestrial, it probably, in common with most
\par reptiles, enjoyed frequent bathing, and when not so engaged,
\par or basking in the sun, secluded itself under some overhanging
\par bank or cavern.
\par The idea of its fondness for swallows, and power of
\par attracting them, mentioned in some traditions, may not impossibly
\par have been derived from these birds hawking round
\par and through its open jaws in the pursuit of the flies attracted
\par by the viscid humours of its mouth. We know that at the
\par present day a bird, the trochilus of the ancients, freely
\par enters the open mouth of the crocodile, and rids it of the

\par THE SEA-SERPENT.
\par On the dark bottom of the great salt lake
\par Imprisoned lay the giant snake,
\par With naught his sullen sleep to break.
\par Poets of the North,
\par "
\par Oelenschlseger." Translated by
\par Longfellow.
\par THAT frank writer, Montaigne, says* :
\par " Yet on the other side it is a sottish presumption to disdaine
\par and condemne that for false, which unto us seemeth to
\par beare no show of likelihood or truth : which is an ordinarie
\par fault in those who perswade themselves to be of more sufficiencie
\par than the vulgar sort.
\par " But reason hath taught me, that so resolutely to condemne
\par a thing for false, and impossible, is to assume unto
\par himself the advantage, to have the bounds and limits of
\par God's will, and of the power of our common mother Nature
\par tied to his sleeve : and that there is no greater folly in the
\par world, than to reduce them to the measure of our capacitie,
\par and bounds of our sufficiencie.
\par " If we term those things monsters or miracles to which
\par our reason cannot attain, how many such doe daily present

\par themselves unto our sight? let us consider through what
\par cloudes, and how blinde-folde we are led to the knowledge
\par of most things, that passe our hands : verily we shall finde,
\par it is rather custome, than Science that removeth the strangenesse
\par of them from us : and that those things, were they
\par newly presented unto us, wee should doubtless deeme
\par them, as much, or more unlikely, and incredible, than any
\par other."
\par Montaigne's remarks seem to me to apply as aptly to the
\par much-vexed question of the existence or non-existence of the
\par sea-serpent as though they had been specially written in
\par reference to it.
\par The sea-serpent, at once the belief and the denied of
\par scientific men ; the accepted and ignored, according to
\par their estimation of the evidence, of reasoners, not scientific
\par perhaps, but intelligent and educated ; the valued basis for
\par items to the journalist, and the quintain for every selfsufficient
\par gobemouche to tilt against ; appearing mysteriously
\par at long intervals and in distant places ; the sea-serpent has
\par as yet avoided capture and the honourable distinction of being
\par catalogued and labelled in our museums.
\par Yet I do believe this weird creature to be a real solid fact,
\par and not a fanciful hallucination. This assertion, however,
\par has to be sustained under many difficulties. The dread of
\par ridicule closes the mouths of many men who could speak
\par upon the subject, while their dependent position forces them
\par to submit to the half-bantering, half-warning expostulations
\par of their employers. When, for example, an unimaginative
\par shipowner breaks jests over his unfortunate shipmaster's
\par head, and significantly hints his hope (as I know to have
\par been the case) that on his next voyage he will see no more
\par sea-serpents, or, in other words, that the great monster
\par belongs to the same genus as the snakes seen in the boots
\par of a western dram-drinker, we may be sure that an important
\par barrier is put to any further communication on the subject
\par 262 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par from that source, at least ;
\par * or when, again, some knot of
\par idle youngsters enliven the monotony of a long voyage by
\par preparing a deliberate hoax for publication on their arrival,
\par a certain amount of discredit necessarily attaches to the
\par monster on the ultimate exposure of the jest.
\par * " I fully believe in this great marine monster. I have as much
\par evidence as to its existence as of anything not seen. Some years ago,
\par Captain Austin Cooper and the officers and crew of the Carlisle Castle,
\par on a vogage to Melbourne, saw the ' varmint.' A description and sketch
\par of it were published in the Argus. This, when it arrived in London, it
\par being the '
\par silly season ' in journalism, was seized and torn to pieces by
\par one of the young lions of the Daily Telegraph, in a leading article, in
\par which much fun was poked at the gallant sailor. ' I don't see any more
\par sea-serpents,' said my Irish friend to me. ' It is too much to be told
\par that one of Green's commanders can't tell the difference between a piece
\par of sea-weed and a live body in the water. If twenty serpents come on
\par the starboard, all hands shall be ordered, to look to port. No London
\par penny-a-liner shall say again that Austin Cooper is a liar and a fool.'
\par After this we softened down over some Coleraine whiskey. Again,
\par some three years ago, the monster was plainly seen off the great reef of
\par New Caledonia by Commandant Villeneuve, and the officers of the
\par French man-of-war, the Seudre. Chassepots were procured to shoot it,
\par but before it came within easy range it disappeared. During my late
\par visit to Fiji, Major James Harding, who was an officer in Cakoban's
\par army when that chief,
\par ' by the grace of God ' was king of Fiji, described
\par exactly the same creature as passing within a few yards of his canoe on
\par a clear moonlight night in the Bay of Suva. It swam towards a small
\par island outside the reef, which is known amongst Fijians as the ' Cave of
\par the Big Snake.' Major Harding is a cool, brave soldier, who saw much
\par hot work with Cakoban's men against the hill tribes of Vonua Levu.
\par He was once riddled by bullets, and left for dead. Accustomed for years
\par to travel about the reefs in canoes, every phase of the aspect of the
\par waters was known to him, and he was not likely to be frightened with
\par false fire. The extraordinary thing is, that the English sailor, the French
\par commander, and the Fijian soldier, all gave the same account of this
\par monster. It is something with a head slightly raised out of the water,
\par and with a sort of mane streaming behind it, whilst the back of a
\par long body is seen underneath the water. So, from these instances, in
\par which I know the witnesses, I fully believe in the sea-serpent. What
\par is there very wonderful in it, after all ? The whale is the largest living
\par thing. Why shouldn't the waters produce snakes of gigantic size."
\par THE VAGABOND, in Supplement to the Australasian, September 10, 1881.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 263
\par Men also occasionally deceive themselves, and while
\par honestly believing that they have seen his oceanic majesty,
\par produce a story which, on analysis, crumbles into atoms and
\par crowns him with disgrace as an impostor.
\par The hard logic of science, in the hand of one of our
\par master minds, has also been arrayed against him, but fortunately
\par weighs rather against special avatars than against
\par his existence absolutely.
\par Finally, the narratives of different observers disagree so
\par much in detail that we have a difficulty in reconciling them,
\par except upon the supposition that they relate to several distinct
\par creatures, a supposition which I shall hope to show is
\par not improbable, as well as that the term sea-serpent is an
\par unwarranted specific differentiation of that of sea-monster,
\par the various creatures collectively so designated being neither
\par serpents nor, indeed, always mutually related. In commencing
\par my record, I must bear in mind Mrs. Glasse's proverbially
\par excellent advice, and admit that it is simply a
\par history of the various appearances of a creature or creatures
\par too fugitive to admit of specific examination, and that until,
\par by some remarkable stroke of fortune, specimens are secured,
\par their zoological status must remain an unsolved, although
\par closely guessed at, problem.
\par I have elsewhere stated my conviction that the serpent
\par Midgard is only a corruption of accounts of the sea-serpent
\par handed down from times when a supernatural existence was
\par attributed to it ; and we have in the Sagas probably the
\par earliest references to it, unless, perhaps, the serpents mentioned
\par by Aristotle, which attacked and overset the galleys off the
\par Libyan coast, may have been of this species.
\par The coast of Norway, deeply indented by fjords, the
\par channels of which, for a certain breadth, have a depth equal
\par to that of the sea outside, seldom less than four hundred
\par fathoms, and corresponding in some degree with the height
\par of the precipitous cliffs which enclose them, abounding in
\par 264 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par all kinds of fish, and in the season with whales, which at
\par one time used to number thousands in a shoal, appears,
\par until within the last thirty years, to have been peculiarly
\par the favourite haunt of the serpent. Paddle and screw are
\par probably answerable for his non-appearance on the surface
\par lately.
\par The west coast of the Isle of Skye is another locality from
\par which several reports of it have been received during this
\par century; less frequently it has been observed upon the
\par eastern American coast-line, upon the sea-board of China,
\par and in various portions of the broad ocean. It generally
\par follows the track of whales, and in two instances observers
\par affirm that it has been seen in combat with them.
\par I have no doubt but that the literature of Norway contains
\par frequent references to it of olden date, but the earliest notice
\par of it in that country which I have been able to procure is
\par one contained in A Narrative of the North-East Frosty Seas,
\par declared by the Duke of Mosconia his ambassadors to a
\par learned gentlemen of Italy, named Galeatius Butrigarius, as
\par follows* :
\par " The lake called Mos, and the Island of Hoffusen in
\par myddest thereof is in the degree 45.30 and 61. In this
\par lake appeareth a strange monster, which is a serpent
\par of huge bigness; and as, to all other places of the world,
\par blazing stars do portend alteration, so doth this to Norway.
\par It was seen of late in the year of Christ 152'2, appearing
\par far above the water, rowling like a great pillar, and
\par was by conjecture far off esteemed to be of fifty cubits in
\par length."
\par Pontoppidan, the Bishop of Bergen, who published
\par his celebrated Natural History of Norway in 1755, and
\par who had at one time discredited its existence " till that
\par suspicion was removed by full and sufficient evidence from
\par * Contained in Eden's Travels.

\par creditable and experienced fishermen and sailors in Norway,
\par of which there are hundreds, who can testify that they have
\par annually seen them," states that the North traders, who came
\par to Bergen every year with their merchandise, thought it a
\par very strange question, when they were seriously asked whether
\par there were any such creatures, as ridiculous, in fact, as if the
\par question had been put to them whether there be such fish
\par as eel or cod.
\par According to Pontoppidan, these creatures continually keep
\par at the bottom of the sea, excepting in the months of July and
\par August, which is their spawning time, and then they come to
\par the surface in calm weather, but plunge into the water again
\par so soon as the wind raises the least wave.
\par It was supposed by the Norway fishermen to have a great
\par objection to castor, with which they provided themselves
\par when going out to sea, shutting it up in a hole in the stern,
\par and throwing a little overboard when apprehensive of meeting
\par the sea-snake. The Faroe fisherman had the same idea
\par with reference to the Tvold whale, which was supposed to
\par have a great aversion to castor and to shavings of juniper
\par wood.
\par Olaus Magnus, in his Histor. Septentrion, chap, xxvii.,
\par writing not from personal observation but from the relations
\par of others, speaks of it as being two hundred feet in length
\par and twenty feet round, having a mane two feet long, being
\par covered with scales, having fiery eyes, disturbing ships, and
\par raising itself up like a mast, and sometimes snapping some
\par of the men from the deck.
\par Aldrovandus, quoting Olaus Magnus, says that about Norway
\par there occasionally appears a serpent reaching to one
\par hundred or two hundred feet in length, dangerous to ships
\par in calm weather, as it sometimes snatches a man from the
\par ship. It is said that merchant ships are involved by it and
\par sunk.
\par Olaus Magnus also figures another serpent, which is said
\par 266 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 267
\par to inhabit the Baltic or Swedish Sea ; it is from thirty to
\par forty feet in length, and will not hurt anyone unless
\par provoked.
\par Arndt. Bernsen, in his account of the fertility of Denmark
\par and Norway, says that the sea-snake, as well as the Tvold
\par whale, often sinks both men and boats; and Pontoppidan
\par was informed by the North traders that the sea-snake has
\par frequently raised itself up and thrown itself across a boat, and
\par even across a vessel of some hundred tons burthen, and by
\par its weight sunk it to the bottom ; and that they would sometimes
\par raise their frightful heads and snap a man out of a
\par boat; but this Pontoppidan does not vouch for, and, indeed,
\par says that if anything, however light, be thrown at and touch
\par them they generally plunge into the water or take another
\par course.
\par Hans (afterwards Bishop) Egede, in his Full and Particular
\par Relation of my Voyage to Greenland, as a Missionary, in the year
\par 1734, figures and describes a sea-monster which showed
\par itself on his passage. He says : "On the 6th of July 1734,
\par when off the south coast of Greenland, a sea-monster
\par appeared to us, whose head, when raised, was on a level with
\par our main-top. Its snout was long and sharp, and it blew
\par water almost like a whale ; it had large broad paws ; its body
\par was covered with scales ; its skin was rough and uneven ; in
\par other respects it was as a serpent ; and when it dived, its
\par tail, which was raised in the air, appeared to be a whole
\par ship's length from its body."
\par In another work, The New Survey of Old Greenland, Egede
\par speaks of the same monster, with the addition that the body
\par was full as thick and as big in circumference as the ship that
\par he sailed in. The drawing (which I reproduce, Fig. 68)
\par appears to have been taken by another missionary, Mr. Bing,
\par who stated that the creature's eyes seemed red, and like
\par burning tire. The paws mentioned by Egede were probably
\par paddles like those of the Liassic Saurians.
\par MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 269
\par Pontoppidan considers this to be a different monster from
\par the Norway sea-serpent, of which he gives a figure furnished
\par him by the Eev. Hans Strom, made from descriptions of two
\par of his neighbours at Herroe, who had been eye-witnesses of
\par its appearance.
\par Lawrance de Ferry, a captain in the Norwegian Navy,
\par and commander in Bergen in Pontoppidan's time, actually
\par wounded one of the Norwegian serpents, and made two of
\par his men, who were with him in the boat at the time, testify
\par upon oath in court to the truth of the statement which he
\par himself made, as follows :
\par " The latter end of August, in the year 1746, as I was on
\par a voyage, in my return from Trundheim, in a very calm and
\par hot day, having a mind to put in at Molde, it happened that
\par when we were arrived with my vessel within six English
\par miles of the aforesaid Molde, being at a place called Jule-
\par Nfs, as I was reading in a book, I heard a kind of murmuring
\par voice from amongst the men at the oars, who were
\par eight in number, and observed that the man at the helm kept
\par off from the land. Upon this I inquired what was the
\par matter ; and was informed that there was a sea-snake before
\par us. I then ordered the man at the helm to keep to the land
\par again, and to come up with this creature, of which I had
\par heard so many stories. Though the fellows were under
\par some apprehensions, they were obliged to obey my orders.
\par In the meantime this sea-snake passed by us, and we were
\par obliged to tack the vessel about, in order to get nearer to it.
\par As the snake swam faster than we could row, I took my gun,
\par that was ready charged, and fired at it ; on this he immediately
\par plunged under the water. We rowed to the place
\par where it sank down (which in the calm might be easily
\par observed) and lay upon our oars, thinking it would come up
\par again to the surface ; however, it did not. When the snake
\par plunged down, the water appeared thick and red ; perhaps
\par some of the shot might wound it, the distance being very

\par little. The head of this snake, which it held more than two
\par feet above the surface of the water, resembled that of a
\par horse. It was of a greyish colour, and the mouth was quite
\par black and very large. It had black eyes and a long white
\par mane,* that hung down from the neck to the surface of the
\par water. Besides the head and neck, we saw seven or eight
\par folds or coils of this snake, which were very thick, and, as far
\par as we could guess, there was about a fathom distance between
\par each fold. Bergen, 1751."
\par Pontoppidan remarks on the peculiarity of spouting water
\par from the nostrils exhibited by the creature seen by Hans
\par Egede, and states that he had not known it spoken of in
\par any other instance.
\par FIG. 09. THE NORWEGIAN SEA-SERPENT. (According to Pontoppidan.')
\par He also remarks that the Norway sea-snakes differ from
\par the Greenland ones with regard to the skin, which in the
\par former is as smooth as glass, and has not the least wrinkle,
\par except about the neck, where there is a kind of mane, which
\par looks like a parcel of sea-weeds hanging down to the water.
\par Summarising the accounts which had reached him, he estimates
\par the length at about one hundred fathoms or six hundred
\par English feet. He states that it lies on the surface of
\par the water (when it is very calm) in many folds, and that
\par these are in a line with the head; some small parts of the
\par back are to be seen above the surface of the water when it
\par moves or bends, which at a distance appear like so many

\par casks or hogsheads floating in a line, with a considerable
\par distance between each of them.
\par " The creature does not, like the eel or land-snake, taper
\par gradually to a point, but the body, which looks to be as big
\par as two hogsheads, grows remarkably small at once just where
\par the tail begins. The head in all the kinds has a high and
\par broad forehead, but in some a pointed snout, though in
\par others that is flat, like that of a cow or horse, with large
\par nostrils, and several stiff hairs standing out on each side like
\par whiskers."
\par "
\par They add that the eyes of this creature are very large,
\par and of a blue colour, and look like a couple of bright pewter
\par plates. The whole animal is of a dark brown colour, but it
\par is speckled and variegated with light streaks or spots that
\par shine like tortoise-shell. It is of a darker hue about the
\par eyes and mouth than elsewhere, and appears in that part a
\par good deal like those horses which we call Moors-heads."
\par He mentions two places, one at Amunds Vaagen in Nordfiord,
\par the other at the island of Karmen, where carcases of it
\par had been left at high water. He supposes it to be viviparous.
\par In an account of the Laplanders of Finmark, by Knud
\par Leems, with the notes of Gunner, Bishop of Drontheim,
\par (Copenhagen, 1767, 4to., in Danish and Latin),* I find,
\par " The Sea of Finmark also generates the snake or marine
\par serpent, forty paces long, equalling in the size of the head
\par the whale, in form the serpent. This monster has a maned
\par neck, resembling a horse, a back of a grey colour, the belly
\par inclining to white.
\par " On the canicular days, when the sea is calm, the marine
\par serpent usually comes up, winding into various spirals, of
\par which some are above, the others below, the water. The
\par seamen very much dread this monster. Nor while he is

\par coming up do they easily entrust themselves to the dangers
\par of the deep."
\par Mr. J. Kamus records a large sea-snake which was seen in
\par 1687 by many people in Dramsfiorden. It was in very calm
\par weather, and so soon as the sun appeared, and the wind
\par blew a little, it shot away just like a coiled cable that is suddenly
\par thrown out by the sailors ; and they observed that it
\par was some time in stretching out its many folds.
\par Captain (afterwards Sir Arthur) de Capell Brooke* collected
\par all accounts he could, during his journey to the
\par North Cape, respecting the sea-serpent, with the following
\par results :
\par " As I had determined on arriving at the coast to make
\par every inquiry respecting the truth of the accounts which had
\par reached England the preceding year, of the sea-serpent having
\par recently been seen off this part of Norway, I shall simply
\par give the different reports I received during my voyage to the
\par North Cape, leaving others to their own conclusions, and
\par without expressing, at least for the present, my opinion
\par respecting them.
\par " The fisherman at Pejerstad said a serpent was seen two
\par years ago in the Folden-Fjord, the length of which, as far as
\par it was visible, was sixty feet."
\par At Otersoen, the Postmaster, Captain Schielderup, who
\par had formerly been in the Norwegian sea service, and seemed
\par a quick intelligent man, stated that the serpent had actually
\par been off the island for a considerable length of time during
\par the preceding summer, in the narrow parts of the sound,
\par between this island and the continent, and the description he
\par gave was as follows :
\par " It made its appearance for the first time in the month
\par of July 1849 off Otersoen. Previous to this he had often
\par heard of the existence of these creatures, but never before
\par * A. de Brooke, Travels to the North Cape,
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 273
\par believed it. During the whole of that month the weather
\par was excessively sultry and calm ; and the serpent was seen
\par every day nearly in the same part of the Sound.
\par " It continued there while the warm weather lasted, lying
\par motionless, and as if dozing, in the sunbeams.
\par " The number of persons living on the island, he said,
\par was about thirty; the whole of whom, from motives of
\par curiosity, went to look at it while it remained. This was
\par confirmed to me by subsequent inquiries among the inhabitants,
\par who gave a similar account of it. The first time
\par that he saw it he was in a boat, at the distance of two hundred
\par yards. The length of it he supposes to have been
\par about three hundred ells or six hundred feet. Of this he
\par could not speak accurately; but it was of considerable length,
\par and longer than it appeared, as it lay in large coils above
\par the water to the height of many feet. Its colour was greyish.
\par At the distance at which he was, he could not ascertain
\par whether it were covered with scales ; but when it moved it
\par made a loud crackling noise, which he distinctly heard. Its
\par head was shaped like that of a serpent; but he could not tell
\par whether it had teeth or not. He said it emitted a very strong
\par odour ; and that the boatmen were afraid to approach near
\par it, and looked on its coming as a bad sign, as the fish left the
\par coast in consequence ! Such were the particulars he related
\par to me.
\par " The merchant at Krogoen confirmed in every particular
\par the account of Captain Schielderup, and that many of the
\par people of Krogoen had witnessed it.
\par " On the island of Leko I obtained from the son of Peter
\par Greger, the merchant, a young man who employed himself in
\par the fishery, still further information respecting the seaserpent.
\par It was in August of the preceding year, while
\par fishing with others in the Viig or Veg-Fjord, that he saw it.
\par At that time they were on shore hauling in their nets,
\par and it appeared about sixty yards distant from them, at
\par 18
\par 274 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par which they were not a little alarmed, and immediately retreated.
\par What was seen of it above water, he said, appeared
\par six times the length of their boat, of a grey colour, and
\par lying in coils a great height above the surface. Their fright
\par prevented them from attending more accurately to other
\par particulars. In fact, they all fairly took to their heels when
\par they found the monster so near to them.
\par " At Alstahoug I found the Bishop of the Nordlands. The
\par worthy prelate was a sensible and well-informed man, between
\par fifty and sixty years of age. To the testimony of others
\par respecting the existence of the sea-serpent, I shall now add
\par that of the Bishop himself, who was an eye-witness to the
\par appearance of two in the Bay of Shuresund or Sorsund, on
\par the Drontheim Fjord, about eight Norway miles from Drontheiin.
\par He was but a short distance from them, and
\par saw them plainly. They were swimming in large folds, part
\par of which were seen above the water, and the length of what
\par appeared of the largest he judged to be about one hundred
\par feet. They were of a darkish grey colour; the heads hardly
\par discernible, from their being almost under water, and they
\par were visible for only a short time. Before that period he
\par had treated the account of them as fabulous ; but it was now
\par impossible, he said, to doubt their existence, as such numbers
\par of respectable people since that time had likewise seen them
\par on several occasions. He had never met with any person
\par who had seen the kraken, and was inclined to think it a
\par fable.
\par "
\par During the time that I remained at Hundholm, a curious
\par circumstance occurred. One day, when at dinner at Mr.
\par BlackhalPs house, and thinking little of the sea-serpent, concerning
\par which I had heard nothing for some time, a young
\par man, the master of a small fishing-yacht, which had just
\par come in from Drontheim, joined our party. In the course of
\par conversation he mentioned that a few hours before, whilst
\par close to Hundholm, and previous to his entering the harbour,
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 275
\par two sea-snakes passed immediately under his yacht. When
\par he saw them he was on the deck, and, seizing a handspike,
\par he struck at them as they came up close to the ve?sel on the
\par other side, upon which they disappeared. Their length was
\par very great, and their colour greyish, but for the very short
\par time they were visible he could not notice any further
\par particulars.
\par " He had no doubt of their being snakes, as he called
\par them, and the circumstance was related entirely of his own
\par accord."
\par Captain Brooke sums up the reports he received with the
\par following general observations :
\par "
\par Taking upon the whole a fair view of the different
\par accounts related in the foregoing pages respecting the seaserpent,
\par no reasonable person can doubt the fact of some
\par marine animal of extraordinary dimensions, and in all probability
\par of the serpent tribe, having been repeatedly seen by
\par various persons along the Norway and Finmark coasts.
\par These accounts, for the most part, have been given verbally
\par from the mouths of the fishermen, a honest and artless class
\par of men, who, having no motive for misrepresentation, cannot
\par be suspected of a wish to deceive ; could this idea, however,
\par be entertained, the circumstance of their assertions having
\par been so fully confirmed by others, in more distant parts,
\par would be sufficient to free them from any imputation of this
\par kind.
\par " The simple facts are these : In traversing a space of full
\par seven hundred miles of coast, extending to the most northern
\par point, accounts have been received from numerous persons
\par respecting the appearance of an animal called by them a
\par sea-serpent. This of itself would induce some degree of
\par credit to be given to it ; but when these several relations
\par as to the general appearance of the animal, its dimensions,
\par the state of the weather when it was seen, and other particulars,
\par are so fully confirmed, one by the other, at such con-
\par 18 *
\par 276 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par siderable intervening distances, every reasonable man will feel
\par satisfied of the truth of the main fact. Many of the informants,
\par besides, were of superior rank and education; and
\par the opinions of such men as the Amtmand (Governor) of
\par Finmark, Mr. Steen, the clergyman of Carlso, Prosten
\par (Dean) Deinboll of Vadso, and the Bishop of Nordland and
\par Finmark, who was even an eye-witness, ought not to be
\par disregarded.
\par " The Bishop of Nordland has seen two of them about eight
\par miles from Drontheim, the largest being apparently one hundred
\par feet, and, in 1822, one as bulky as an ox, and a quarter
\par of a mile in length, appeared off the island of Soro, near
\par Finmark, and was seen by many people."
\par Not having the Zoologist at hand, I now quote a resume of
\par short notices extracted from it, contained in the Illustrated
\par London News for October 28, 1848, as follows :
\par " Our attention has been drawn to the Zoologist for the
\par past year, wherein are several communications tending to
\par authenticate the existence of the great sea-serpent. Thus,
\par in the number for February 1847, we find paragraphs quoted
\par from the Norse newspapers stating that in the neighbourhood
\par of Christiansund and Molde, in the province of Komsdal, in
\par Norway, several highly respectable and credible witnesses
\par have attested the seeing of the serpent. In general, they
\par state that it has been seen in the larger Norwegian fjords,
\par seldom in the open sea. In the large bight of the sea at
\par Christiansund it has been seen every year, though only in
\par the warmest season, in the dog days, and then only in perfectly
\par calm weather and unruffled water.
\par " Its length is stated at about forty-four feet, and twice as
\par thick as a common snake, in proportion to the length. The
\par front of the head was rather pointed, the eyes sharp, and
\par from the back of the head commenced a mane like that of a
\par horse. The colour of the animal was a blackish brown. It
\par swam swiftly, with serpentine movements like a leech. One
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 257
\par of the witnesses describes the body to be two feet in diameter,
\par the head as long as a brandy anker (ten-gallon cask) and
\par about the same thickness, not pointed, but round. It had no
\par scales, but the body quite smooth. The witness acknowledged
\par Pontoppidan's representation to be like the serpent he
\par saw."
\par " The writer of this article received letters from Mr. Soren
\par Knudtzon, stating that a sea-serpent had been seen in the
\par neighbourhood of Christiansund by several people ; and from
\par Dr. Hoffmann, a respectable surgeon in Molde, stating that,
\par lying on a considerable fjord to the south of Christiansund,
\par Eector Hammer, Mr. Krabt, curate, and several persons,
\par very clearly saw, while on a journey, a sea-serpent of very
\par considerable size.
\par " Four other persons saw a similar animal, July 28th,
\par 1845.
\par " The next communication, dated Sund's Parsonage,
\par August 31st, 1846, records the appearance of a supposed
\par sea-serpent, on the 8th, in the course between the islands of
\par Sartor Leer and Tos. Early on this day, just as the steamer
\par Biorgvin passed through Eogne Fjord, towing a vessel to
\par Bergen, Daniel Solomonson, a cotter, saw a sea-monster
\par swimming from Eogne Fjord in a westerly direction towards
\par his dwelling at Gronnevigskiaeset, in the northern part of the
\par parish of Sund. The head appeared like a Fsering boat
\par (about twenty feet long) keel uppermost ; and from behind it
\par raised itself forward in three, and sometimes four and five
\par undulations, each apparently about twelve feet long. On
\par the same morning a lad, out fishing in the Eogne Fjord,
\par saw a serpent, which he describes to have been sixty feet
\par long."
\par For further information on the Norwegian sea-serpent, I
\par am indebted to the excellent chapter, devoted to the question
\par generally, contained in Mr. Gosse's Eomance of Natural
\par History, First Series, from which I transfer, without abbre278

\par viation, a statement made by the Rev. W. Deinboll, Archdeacon
\par of Molde :
\par " On the 28th of July 1845, J. C. Lund, bookseller and
\par printer ; G-. S. Krogh, merchant ; Christian Flang, Lund's
\par apprentice ; and John Elgensen, labourer, were out on Romsdalfjord,
\par fishing. The sea was, after a warm sunshiny day,
\par quite calm. About seven o'clock in the afternoon, a little
\par distance from shore, near the ballast place and Molde Hove,
\par they saw a large marine animal which slowly moved itself
\par forward, as it appeared to them, with the help of two fins on
\par the fore-part of the body nearest the head, which they judged
\par from the boiling of the water on both sides of it. The visible
\par part of the body appeared to be between forty and fifty feet in
\par length, and moved in undulations like a snake. The body
\par was round and of a dark colour, and seemed to be several
\par ells* in thickness. As they discerned a waving motion in
\par the water behind the animal, they concluded that part of the
\par body was concealed under water. That it was one connected
\par animal they saw plainly from its movement. When the
\par animal was about one hundred yards from the boat, they
\par noticed tolerably correctly its fore-part, which ended in a
\par sharp snout ; its colossal head raised itself above the water
\par in the form of a semi- circle ; the lower part was not visible.
\par The colour of the head was dark brown, and the skin smooth.
\par They did not notice the eyes, or any mane or bristles on the
\par throat. When the serpent came about a musket-shot near,
\par Lund fired at it, and was certain the shots hit it in the head.
\par After the shot he dived but came up immediately ; he raised
\par his head like a snake preparing to dart on its prey. After
\par he had turned and got his body in a straight line, which he
\par appeared to do with great difficulty, he darted like an arrow
\par against the boat. They reached the shore, and the animal,
\par perceiving it had come into shallow water, dived immediately,
\par and disappeared in the deep."

\par Mr. Gosse further quotes a statement made by an Englishman,
\par writing under the signature of " Oxoniensis
\par "
\par in the
\par Times of November 4th, 1848, to the effect that
\par " A parish priest, residing on Romsdalfjord, about two
\par days' journey south of Drontheim, an intelligent person,
\par whose veracity I have no reason to doubt, gave me a circumstantial
\par account of one which he had himself seen. It
\par rose within thirty yards of the boat in which he was, and
\par swam parallel with it for a considerable time. Its head he
\par described as equalling a small cask in size, and its mouth,
\par which it repeatedly opened and shut, was furnished with formidable
\par teeth ; its neck was smaller, but its body, of which
\par he supposed that he saw about half on the surface of the
\par water, was not less in girth than that of a moderate-sized
\par horse. Another gentleman, in whose house I stayed, had
\par also seen one, and gave a similar account of it ; it also came
\par near his boat upon the fjord, when it was fired at, upon
\par which it turned and pursued them to the shore, which was
\par luckily near, when it disappeared. They expressed great
\par surprise at the general disbelief attached to the existence of
\par these animals amongst naturalists, and assured me that there
\par was scarcely a sailor accustomed to those inland lakes who
\par had not seen them at one time or other."
\par The Rev. Alfred C. Smith, M.A., a naturalist, who visited
\par Norway in 1850, summarises the result of his investigations
\par in the words :
\par " and I cannot withhold my belief in the
\par existence of some huge inhabitant of those northern seas,
\par when, to my mind, the fact of his existence has been so
\par clearly proved by numerous eye-witnesses, many of whom
\par were too intelligent to be deceived, and too honest to be
\par doubted."
\par Passing from these numerous narratives, which are distinguished
\par for a remarkable agreement in the main characteristic
\par described, I will proceed to some of those whose scene
\par lies on our own coast.
\par 280 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par In 1809, Mr. McLean, the parish minister of Eigg, communicated
\par to Dr. Neil, the Secretary of the Wernerian
\par Society, the following statement :
\par *
\par " I saw the animal of which you inquire, in June 1808, on
\par the coast of Coll. Rowing along that coast, I observed, at
\par about the distance of half a mile, an object to windward,
\par which gradually excited astonishment. At first view itappeared
\par like a small rock ; but knowing that there was no
\par rock in that situation, I fixed my eyes closely upon it. Then
\par I saw it elevated considerably above the level of the sea, and,
\par after a slow movement, distinctly perceived one of its eyes.
\par Alarmed at the unusual appearance and magnitude of the
\par animal, I steered so as to be at no great distance from the
\par shore. When nearly in a line between it and the shore,
\par the monster, directing its head, which still continued above
\par water, towards us, plunged violently under water, Certain
\par that he was in chase of us, we plied hard to get ashore. Just
\par as we leapt out on a rock, and had taken a station as high
\par as we conveniently could, we saw it coming rapidly under
\par water towards the stern of our boat. When within a few
\par yards of it, finding the water shallow, it raised its monstrous
\par head above water, and, by a winding course, got, with apparent
\par difficulty, clear of the creek where our boat lay, and where
\par the monster seemed in danger of being embayed. It continued
\par to move off, with its head above water and with the
\par wind, for about half a mile before we lost sight of it. Its head
\par was somewhat broad, and of form somewhat oval; its neck
\par somewhat smaller ; its shoulders, if I can so term them, considerably
\par broader, and thence it tapered towards the tail, which
\par last it kept pretty low in the water, so that a view of it could
\par not be taken so distinctly as I wished. It had no fins that I
\par could perceive, and seemed to me to move progressively by
\par undulation up and down. Its length I believed to be
\par Transactions of the Wernerian Society, vol. i. p. 442.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 281
\par between seventy and eighty feet. When nearest to me it did
\par not raise its head wholly above water, so that, the neck being
\par under water, I could perceive no shining filaments thereon, if
\par it had any. Its progressive motion under water I took to be
\par very rapid. About the time I saw it, it was seen near the
\par Isle of Canna. The crews of thirteen fishing-boats, I am
\par told, were so much terrified at its appearance, that they, in a
\par body, fled from it to the nearest creek for safety. On the
\par passage from Kum to Canna, the crew of one boat saw it
\par coming towards them, with the wind, and its head high above
\par water. One of the crew pronounced the head as large as a little
\par boat, and its eye as large as a plate. The men were much
\par terrified, but the monster offered them no molestation."
\par I next extract, from the pages of the Inverness Courier,
\par some very pertinent remarks upon a description of the seamonster
\par seen by the Rev. Messrs. McRae and Twopeny, contained
\par in the Zoologist, and I add the article there referred
\par to. I had the advantage of hearing from a gentleman
\par related to Mr. McRae that he could substantiate his statement,
\par having himself about the same time, and in that
\par locality, observed the same appearance, though at a greater
\par distance off.
\par The following is the article in the Inverness Courier:
\par " We are glad to see that the two gentlemen who favoured
\par us last autumn with an account of what they believed to be
\par a strange animal seen off the west coast, Inverness-shire,
\par have published in the Zoologist, a monthly journal of natural
\par history, a careful description of the creature which they saw,
\par and which seems to resemble the engravings of what is called
\par the Norwegian sea-serpent. We subjoin the magazine
\par article entire. There is such a dread of ridicule in appearing
\par publicly in company with this mysterious and disreputable
\par monster, that we must commend the boldness of the two
\par clergymen in putting their names to the narrative ; especially
\par as we observe that other observers have not been so
\par 282 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par courageous, and that they have been obliged to give some of
\par their information anonymously.
\par 11 The huge serpent, if serpent it may be called, invariably
\par appears in still warm weather, and in no other.
\par There are certain Norwegian fjords and narrow seas which it
\par frequents, and it is scarcely ever seen in the open sea. In
\par the present case, the limit in which the animal has been seen
\par on our coast, is Lochduich to the north and the Sound of
\par Mull to the south, only about a fifth of the space between
\par Cape Wrath and the Mull of Kintyre ; and it is in that part
\par it should be most looked for. We beg to draw the attention
\par of our readers on the West Coast to the fact, now established
\par on indubitable evidence, of the supposed animal having been
\par seen there last year, and to the possibility of its appearing
\par again in similar weather this year. If it chances to turn up
\par once more, some full and accurate account of the phenomenon
\par would certainly be most desirable."
\par The following is the article in the Zoologist* :
\par Appearance of an animal, believed to be that which is called the Norwegian
\par Sea-serpent, on the Western Coast of Scotland, in August
\par 1872, by the Rev. John McRae, Minister of Glenelg, Invernessshire,
\par and the Eev. David Twopeny, Vicar of Stockbury, Kent.
\par On the 20th of August 1872 we started from Glenelg in a small
\par cutter, the Leda, for an excursion to Lochourn. Our party consisted,
\par besides ourselves, of two ladies, F. and K., a gentleman, G. B., and a
\par Highland lad. Our course lay down the Sound of Sleat, which on that
\par side divides the Isle of Skye from the mainland, the average breadth
\par of the channel in that part being two miles.
\par It was calm and sunshiny, not a breath of air, and the sea perfectly
\par smooth. As we were getting the cutter along with oars we perceived a
\par dark mass about two hundred yards astern of us, to the north. While
\par we were looking at it with our glasses (we had three on board) another
\par similar black lump rose to the left of the first, leaving an interval
\par between ; then another and another followed, all in regular order. We
\par did not doubt its being one living creature : it moved slowly across
\par our wake, and disappeared. Presently the first mass, which was
\par * No. 92, May 1873 ; London, Van Voorst.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT.
\par evidently the head, reappeared, and was followed by the rising of the
\par other black lumps, as before. Sometimes three appeared, sometimes
\par four, five, or six, and then sank again. When they rose, the head
\par appeared first, if it had been down, and the lumps rose after it in
\par regular order, beginning always with that next the head, and rising
\par gently ; but when they sank, they sank altogether rather abruptly,
\par sometimes leaving the head visible.
\par It gave the impression of a creature crooking up its back to sun
\par itself. There was no appearance of undulation ; when the lumps sank,
\par other lumps did not rise in the intervals between them. The greatest
\par number we counted was seven, making eight with head, as shown in
\par sketch No. 1 [two engravings are given]. The parts were separated from
\par each other by intervals of about their own length, the head being rather
\par smaller and flatter than the rest, and the nose being very slightly
\par visible above the water ; but we did not see the head raised above the
\par surface either this or the next day, nor could we see the eye. We
\par had no means of measuring the length with any accuracy ; but taking
\par the distance from the centre of one lump to the centre of the next to
\par be six feet, and it could scarcely be less, the whole length of the
\par portion visible, including the intervals submerged, would be forty-five
\par feet.
\par Presently, as we were watching the creature, it began to approach us
\par rapidly, causing a great agitation in the sea. Nearly the whole of the
\par body, if not all of it, had now disappeared, and the head advanced at a
\par great rate in the midst of a shower of fine spray, which was evidently
\par raised in some way by the quick movement of the animal it did not
\par appear how and not by spouting. F. was alarmed and retreated to the
\par cabin, crying out that the creature was coming down upon us. When
\par within about a hundred yards of us it sank and moved away in the
\par direction of Syke, just under the surface of the water, for we could trace
\par its course by the waves it raised on the still sea to the distance of a
\par mile or more. After this it continued at intervals to show itself,
\par careering about at a distance, as long as we were in that part of the
\par Sound ; the head and a small part only of the body being visible on the
\par surface ; but we did not again, on that day, see it so near nor so well as
\par at first.
\par At one time F. and K. and G. B. saw a fin sticking up at a little
\par distance back from the head, but neither of us were then observing. On
\par our return the next day we were again becalmed on the north side of the
\par opening of Lochourn, where it is about three miles wide, the day warm
\par and sunshiny as before. As we were dragging slowly along in the afternoon
\par the creature again appeared over towards the south side, at a
\par greater distance than we saw it the first day. Tt now showed itself in
\par three or four rather long lines, as in the sketch No. 2, and looked considerably
\par longer than it did the day before ; as nearly as we could com284
\par MYTHICAL MONSTEUS.
\par pute, it looked at least sixty feet in length. Soon it began careering
\par about, showing but a small part of itself, as on the day before, and
\par appeared to be going up Lochourn. Later in the afternoon, when we
\par were still becalmed in the mouth of Lochourn, and by using the oars
\par had nearly reached the island of Sandaig, it came rushing past us about
\par a hundred and fifty yards to the south, on its return from Lochourn.
\par It went with great rapidity, its black head only being visible through
\par the clear sea, followed by a long trail of agitated water. As it shot
\par along, the noise of its rush through the water could be distinctly heard
\par on board. There were no organs of motion to be seen, nor was there
\par any shower of spray as on the day before, but merely such a commotion
\par in the sea as its quick passage might be expected to make. Its progress
\par was equable and smooth, like that of a log towed rapidly. For the rest
\par of the day, as we worked our way home northwards through the Sound
\par of Sleat, it was occasionally within sight of us until nightfall, rushing
\par about at a distance, as before, and showing only its head, and a small
\par part of its body on the surface. It seemed on each day to keep about
\par us, and as we were always then rowing, we were inclined to think it
\par perhaps might be attracted by the measured sound of the oars. Its only
\par exit in this direction to the north was by the narrow Strait of Kylerhea,
\par dividing Skye from the mainland, and only a third of a mile wide, and
\par we left our boat, wondering whether this strange creature had gone that
\par way or turned back again to the south. We have only to add to this
\par narrative of what we saw ourselves, the following instances of its being
\par seen by other people, of the correctness of which we have no doubt.
\par The ferrymen on each side of Kylerhea saw it pass rapidly through on
\par the evening of the 21st, and heard the rush of the water ; they were
\par surprised, and thought it might be a shoal of porpoises, but could not
\par comprehend their going so quickly.
\par Finlay McEae, of Bundaloch, in the parish of Kintail, was within the
\par mouth of Lochourn on the 2J st, with other men in his boat, and saw the
\par creature at about the distance of one hundred and fifty yards. Two
\par days after we saw it, Alexander Macmillan, boat-builder at Dornie, was
\par fishing in a boat in the entrance of Lochduich, half-way between
\par Druidag and Castledonan, when he saw the animal, near enough to hear
\par the noise, and see the ripple it made in rushing along in the sea. He
\par says that what seemed its head was followed by four or more lumps, or
\par "
\par half-rounds," as he calls them, and that they sometimes rose and sometimes
\par sank altogether. He estimated its length at not less than between
\par sixty and eighty feet. He saw it also on two subsequent days in Lochduich.
\par On all these occasions his brother, Farquhar, was with him in
\par the boat, and they were both much alarmed, and pulled to the shore
\par in great haste.
\par A lady at Duisdale, in Skye, a place overlooking the part of the Sound
\par which is opposite the opening of Lochourn, said that she was looking
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 285
\par out with a glass when she saw a strange object on the sea, which
\par appeared like eight seals in a row. This was just about the time that we
\par saw it. We were also informed that about the same time it was seen
\par from the island of Eigg, between Eigg and the mainland, about twenty
\par miles to the south-west of the opening of Lochourn. We have not
\par permission to mention the names in these two last instances.

\par P.8. The writers of the above account scarcely expect the public to
\par believe in the existence of the creature which they ^saw. Bather than
\par that, they look for the disbelief and ridicule to which the subject
\par always gives rise, partly on account of the animal having been pronounced
\par to be a snake, without any sufficient evidence, but principally
\par because of the exaggerations and fables with which the whole subject is
\par beset. Nevertheless, they consider themselves bound to leave a record
\par of what they saw, in order that naturalists may receive it as a piece of
\par evidence, or not, according to what they think it is worth. The animal
\par will very likely turn up on those coasts again, and it will be always in
\par that " dead season," so convenient to editors of newspapers, for it is
\par never seen but in the still warm days of summer or early autumn.
\par There is a considerable probability that it has visited the same coasts
\par before.
\par In the summer of 1871, some large creature was seen for some time
\par rushing about in Lochduich, but it did not show itself sufficiently for
\par anyone to ascertain what it was. Also, some years back, a well-known
\par gentleman of the West Coast, now living, was crossing the Sound of
\par Mull, from Mull to the mainland,
\par " on a very calm afternoon, when,"
\par as he writes,
\par " our attention was attracted to a monster which had come
\par to the surface, not more than fifty yards from our boat. It rose without
\par causing the slightest disturbance of the sea, or making the slightest
\par noise, and floated for some time on the surface, but without exhibiting
\par its head or tail, showing only the ridge of the back, which was not that
\par of a whale or any other sea animal that I had ever seen. The back
\par appeared sharp and ridge-like, and in colour very dark, indeed black,
\par or almost so. It rested quietly for a few minutes, and then dropped
\par quietly down into the deep, without causing the slightest agitation. I
\par should say that about forty feet of it, certainly not less, appeared on
\par the surface."
\par It should be noticed that the inhabitants of that Western Coast are
\par quite familiar with the appearance of whales, seals, and porpoises, and
\par when they see them they recognise them at once. Whether the creature
\par which pursued Mr. McLean's boat off the island of Coll in ]808, and
\par of which there is an account in the Transactions of the Wernerian
\par Society (vol, i. p. 442), was one of these Norwegian animals, it is not
\par 286 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par easy to say. Survivors who knew Mr. McLean, say that he could quite
\par be relied upon for truth.
\par The public are not likely to believe in the creature till it is caught,
\par and that does not seem likely to happen just yet, for a variety of
\par reasons, one reason being that it has, from all the accounts given of it,
\par the power of moving very rapidly. On the 20th, while we were becalmed
\par in the mouth of Lochourn, a steam-launch slowly passed us,
\par and, as we watched it, we reckoned its rate at five or six miles an hour.
\par When the animal rushed past us on the next day at about the same
\par distance, and when we were again becalmed nearly in the same place,
\par we agreed that it went twice as fast as the steamer, and we thought
\par that its rate could not be less than ten or twelve miles an hour. It
\par might be shot, but would probably sink. There are three accounts of its
\par being shot at in Norway ; in one instance it sank, and in the other two
\par it pursued the boats, which were near the shore, but disappeared when
\par it found itself getting into shallow water.
\par It should be mentioned that when we saw this creature, and made our
\par sketches of it, we had never seen either Pontoppidan's Natural History
\par or his print of the Norwegian sea-serpent, which has a most striking
\par resemblance to the first of our own sketches. Considering the great
\par body of reasonable Norwegian evidence, extending through a number of
\par years, which remains after setting aside fables and exaggerations, it
\par seems surprising that no naturalist of that country has ever applied
\par himself to make out something about the animal. In the meantime, as
\par the public will most probably be dubious about quickly giving credit to
\par our account, the following explanations are open to them, all of which
\par have been proposed to me, viz. : porpoises, lumps of sea-weed, empty
\par herring-barrels, bladders, logs of wood, waves of the sea, and inflated
\par pig-skins ! but as all these theories present to our mind greater difficulties
\par than the existence of the animal itself, we feel obliged to decline
\par them.
\par The editor of the Zoologist adds :
\par I have long since expressed my firm conviction that there exists a
\par large marine animal unknown to us naturalists ; I maintain this belief
\par as firmly as ever.
\par I totally reject the evidence of published representations ; but I do
\par not allow these imaginary figures to interfere with a firm conviction.
\par Here, again, we have the same general resemblances,
\par observed under the same conditions of weather, as in the case
\par of the Norwegian serpent. As to the pursuit, which may
\par either have been urged from motives of curiosity or of anger,
\par it is curious to find a remarkable account of a similar incident
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 287
\par in Kotzebue's Vogages, where it is stated that M. Kriukoff,
\par while in a boat at Beering's Island, was pursued by an
\par animal like a red serpent, and immensely long, with a head
\par like that of a sea-lion, but the eyes disproportionately large.
\par "It was fortunate," observed M. Kriukoff,
\par " we were so near
\par land, or the monster would have swallowed us ; he raised his
\par head far above the surface, and the sea-lions were so terrified,
\par that some rushed into the water, and others concealed
\par themselves on the shore !
\par "
\par The last notice of its appearance in British waters is
\par extracted from Nature, as follows :
\par Believing it to be desirable that every well-authenticated observation
\par indicating the existence of large sea-serpents should be permanently
\par registered, I send you the following particulars :
\par About three P.M. on Sunday, September 3, 1882, a party of gentlemen
\par and ladies were standing at the northern extremity of Llandudno
\par pier, looking towards the open sea, when an unusual object was
\par observed in the water near to the Little Orme's Head, travelling
\par rapidly westwards towards the Great Orme. It appeared to be just
\par outside the mouth of the bay, and would therefore be about a mile
\par distant from the observers. - It was watched for about two minutes, and
\par in that interval it traversed about halt' the width of the bay, and then
\par suddenly disappeared. The bay is two miles wide, and therefore the
\par object, whatever it was, must have travelled at the rate of thirty miles
\par an hour. It is estimated to have been fully as long as a large steamer,
\par say two hundred feet ; the rapidity of its motion was particularly
\par remarked as being greater than that of any ordinary vessel. The colour
\par appeared to be black, and the motion either corkscrew-like or snake-like,
\par with vertical undulations. Three of the observers have since made
\par sketches from memory, quite independently, of the impression left on their
\par minds, and on comparing these sketches, which slightly varied, they
\par have agreed to sanction the accompanying outline as representing as
\par nearly as possible the object which they saw. The party consisted of
\par W. Barfoot, J.P., of Leicester, F. J. Marlow, solicitor, of Manchester,
\par Mrs. Marlow, and several others. They discard the theories of birds or
\par porpoises as not accounting for this particular phenomenon.
\par F. T. MOTT.
\par Birstall Hill, Leicester,
\par January lo'th, 1883.
\par 288 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par It must also be mentioned that Dr. Hibbert* states that
\par the sea-serpent has been seen in the Shetland seas, and
\par instances one seen off the Isle Stonness, Valley Island, and
\par Dunvossness.
\par The first that we hear of the appearance of the sea-serpent
\par in American waters is of one which appeared on the coast of
\par Maine, in Penobscot Bay, at intervals, during the thirty years
\par preceding 1809. The Kev. Abraham Cummings, who reports
\par this, saw it himself at a distance of about eighty yards, and
\par considered it to be seventy feet long ; it was seen by the
\par British in their expedition to Bagaduse, during the first
\par American war, and supposed to be three hundred feet long.
\par The next record relates to one appearing in August 1817,
\par which was frequently seen in the harbour of Gloucester, Cape
\par Aure, about thirty miles from Boston. It is the subject of
\par a report, published by a committee appointed by the Linnsean
\par Society of New England. Dr. Hamilton summarises the
\par results as follows :
\par " The affidavits of a great many individuals of unblemished
\par character are collected, which leaves no room to apprehend
\par anything like deceit. They do not agree in every minute
\par particular, but in regard to its great length and snake-like
\par form, they are harmonious/'
\par Eleven depositions were taken, in which the length
\par was variously estimated at from fifty to one hundred
\par feet. It was either seen lying perfectly still, extended upon
\par the surface of the water, or progressing rapidly at the rate
\par of a mile in two, or at the most three, minutes ; the mode of
\par progression is generally spoken of as vertical undulation. The
\par tenth deposition states :
\par " On the 20th of June 1815, my boy
\par informed me of an unusual appearance on the surface of the
\par sea in the Cove. When I viewed it through the glass, I was
\par in a moment satisfied that it was some aquatic animal, with
\par Shetland Islands, p. 565.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT.
\par the form, motions, and appearance of which I was not previously
\par acquainted. It was about a quarter of a mile from
\par the shore, and was moving with great rapidity to the southward
\par ; it appeared about thirty feet in length. Presently it
\par turned about, and then displayed a greater length, I suppose
\par at least one hundred feet. It then came towards me very
\par rapidly, and lay entirely still on the surface of the water.
\par His appearance then was like a string of buoys. I saw
\par thirty or forty of these protuberances, or bunches, which
\par were about the size of a barrel. The head appeared six or
\par eight feet long, and tapered off to the size of a horse's head.
\par He then appeared about one hundred and twenty feet long ;
\par the body appeared of a uniform size ; the colour deep brown.
\par I could not discover any eye, mane, gills, or breathing holes.
\par I did not see any fins or lips/
\par 5
\par One of the Committee of the Linnsean Society was himself
\par an eye-witness, and Colonel Perkins, of Boston, published in
\par 1848 a communication which was a copy of a letter he had
\par written in 1820, detailing his personal experience in confirmation
\par of the Society's Keport, as follows :
\par " In a few
\par moments after my exclamation, I saw, on the opposite side
\par of the harbour, at about two miles from where I had first
\par seen, or thought I saw, the snake, the same object, moving
\par with a rapid motion up the harbour, on the western shore.
\par As he approached us, it was easy to see that his motion was
\par not that of the common snake, either on the land or in the
\par water, but evidently the vertical movement of the caterpillar.
\par As nearly as I could judge, there was visible at a time about
\par forty feet of his body. It was not, to be sure, a continuity
\par of body, as the form from head to tail (except as the apparent
\par bunches appeared as he moved through the water) was seen
\par only at three or four feet asunder. It was very evident,
\par however, that his length must be much greater than what
\par appeared, as in his movement he left a considerable wake in
\par his rear, I had a fine glass, and was within from one-third
\par 19
\par 290 MYTHICAL MONSTEKS.
\par to half a mile of him. The head was flat in the water,
\par and the animal was, as far as I could distinguish, of a chocolate
\par colour. I was struck with an appearance in front of the
\par head like a single horn, about nine inches to a foot in length,
\par and of the form of a marline -spike. There were a great
\par many people collected by this time, many of whom had
\par before seen the same object, and the same appearance.
\par From the time I first saw him until he passed by the place
\par where I stood, and soon after disappeared, was not more
\par than fifteen or twenty minutes.
\par "
\par Subsequent to the period of which I have been speaking,
\par the snake was seen by several of the crews of our coasting
\par vessels, and in some instances within a few yards. Captain
\par Tappan, a person well known to me, saw him with his head
\par above the water two or three feet, at times moving with great
\par rapidity, and at others slowly. He also saw what explained
\par the appearance, which I have described, of a horn on the
\par front of the head. This was doubtless what was observed
\par by Captain Tappan to be the tongue, thrown in an upright
\par position from the mouth, and having the appearance which
\par I have given to it.
\par 16 One of the revenue cutters, whilst in the neighbourhood
\par of Cape Ann, had an excellent view of him at a few yards'
\par distance. He moved slowly ; and upon the approach of the
\par vessel, sank and was seen no more."
\par Dr. Hamilton* states that an animal of similar appearance
\par was again seen, in August 1819, off Nahant, Boston, and
\par remained in the neighbourhood for some weeks. Two hundred
\par persons witnessed it, thirteen folds were counted, and
\par the head, which was serpent-shaped, was elevated two feet
\par above the surface. Its eye was remarkably brilliant and
\par glistening. The water was smooth, and the weather calm
\par and serene. When it disappeared, its motion was undulatory,
\par * Jardine's Naturalist's Library, vol. xxv.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 291
\par making curves perpendicular to the surface of the water, and
\par giving the appearance of a long moving string of corks. It
\par appeared again off Nahant in July 1833. " It was first
\par seen on Saturday afternoon, passing between Egg Eock and
\par the Promontory, winding his way into Lynn Harbour ; and
\par again on Sunday morning, heading for South Shores. It
\par was seen by forty or fifty ladies and gentlemen, who insist
\par that they could not have been deceived.
\par "
\par The Zoologist for May 1847 contains an account of a seaserpent
\par seen in Mahone Bay, about forty miles east of
\par Halifax, by five officers of the garrison, when on a fishing
\par excursion :
\par " We were surprised by the sight of an immense
\par shoal of grampuses, which appeared in an unusual state of
\par excitement, and which in their gambols approached so close
\par to our little craft that some of the party amused themselves
\par by firing at them with rifles. At this time we were jogging
\par at about five miles an hour, and must have been crossing
\par Margaret's Bay,
\par ' when suddenly,' at a distance of from a
\par hundred and fifty to two hundred yards on our starboard bow,
\par we saw the head and neck of some denizen of the deep, precisely
\par like those of a common snake, in the act of swimming,
\par the head so far elevated and thrown forward by the curve of
\par the neck, as to enable us to see the water under and beyond
\par it. The creature rapidly passed, leaving a regular wake,
\par from the commencement of which to the fore part, which
\par was out of water, we judged in length to be about eighty
\par feet, and this within rather than beyond the mark. It is
\par most difficult to give correctly the dimensions of any object
\par in the water. The head of the creature we set down at about
\par six feet in length, and that portion of the neck which we saw
\par the same ; the extreme length, as before stated, at between
\par eighty and one hundred feet. The neck in thickness equalled
\par the bole of a moderate-sized tree. The head and neck of a
\par dark brown or nearly black colour, streaked with white in irregular
\par streaks, I do not recollect seeing any part of the body."

\par FIG. 70. SEA-SERPENT SEEN BY THE CREW OF H.M.S. "
\par DAEDALUS," IN 1848.
\par H.M.S. Dcedalus,
\par Hamoaze, Oct. 11.
\par SIR, In reply to your letter of this day's date, requiring information
\par as to the truth of a statement published in the Times newspaper, of a
\par sea-serpent of extraordinary dimensions having been seen from Her
\par Majesty's ship Dwdalus, under my command, on her passage from 'the
\par East Indies, I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of
\par my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that at 5 o'clock P.M. on the
\par 6th of August last, in latitude 24 44' S. and longitude 9 22' E., the
\par weather dark and cloudy, wind fresh from the N.W., with a long ocean
\par swell from the S.W., the ship on the port tack, heading N.E. by N.,
\par something very unusual was seen by Mr. Sartoris, midshipman, rapidly
\par approaching the ship from before the beam. The circumstance was
\par immediately reported by him to the officer of the watch, Lieutenant
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 293
\par Edgar Druinmond, with whom and Mr. William Barrett, the master, I
\par was at the time walking the quarter-deck. The ship's company were at
\par supper.
\par On our attention being called to the object, it was discovered to be
\par an enormous serpent, with head and shoulders kept about four feet
\par constantly above the surface of the sea; and as nearly as we could
\par approximate by comparing it with the length of what our main topsail -
\par yard would show in the water, there was at the very least sixty feet of
\par the animal a fleur d'eau, no portion of which was, in our perception,
\par used in propelling it through the water, either by vertical or horizontal
\par undulation. It passed rapidly, but so close under our lee quarter that
\par had it been a man of my acquaintance I should have easily recognized
\par his features with the naked eye ; and it did not, either in approaching
\par the ship or after it had passed our wake, deviate in the slightest degree
\par from its course to the S.W., which it held on at the pace of from
\par twelve to fifteen miles per hour, apparently on some determined purpose.
\par The diameter of the serpent was about fifteen or sixteen inches behind
\par the head, which was, without any doubt, that of a snake ; and it was
\par never, during the twenty minutes that it continued in sight of our
\par glasses, once below the surface of the water ; its colour, a dark brown
\par with yellowish white about the throat. It had no fins, but something
\par like the mane of a horse, or rather a bunch of sea-weed, washed about
\par its back. It was seen by the quarter-master, the boatswain's mate, and
\par the man at the wheel, in addition to myself and officers above mentioned.
\par I ani having a drawing of the serpent made from a sketch taken
\par immediately after it was seen, which I hope to have ready for transmission
\par to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by to-morrow's post.
\par I have, &c.,

\par in illustration of a short but very valuable memoir, and is

\par Glasgow, Oct. 19, 1848.
\par SIR, I have just reached this port, on a voyage from Malta to
\par Lisbon, and niy attention having been called to a report relative to an
\par 294 MYTHICAL MONSTEM.
\par animal seen by the master and crew of Her Majesty's ship Dcedalus, I
\par take the liberty of communicating the following circumstance :
\par " When clearing out of the port of Lisbon, upon the 30th of September
\par last, we spoke the American brig Daphne, of Boston, Mark
\par Trelawny master ; she signalled for us to heave to, which we did, and
\par standing close round her counter lay to while the mate boarded us with
\par the jolly boat, and handed a packet of letters, to be despatched per
\par first steamer for Boston on our arrival in England. The mate told me
\par that when in lat. 4 11' S., long. 10 15' E., wind dead north, upon the
\par 20th of September, a most extraordinary animal had been seen.
\par From his description, it had the appearance of a huge serpent or
\par snake, with a dragon's head.
\par "
\par Immediately upon its being seen, one of the deck guns was brought
\par to bear upon it, which, having been charged with spike-nails and whatever
\par other pieces of iron could be got at the moment, was discharged
\par at the animal, then only distant about forty yards from the ship. It
\par immediately reared its head in the air, and plunged violently with its
\par body, showing evidently that the charge had taken effect. The Daphne
\par was to leeward at the time, but was put about on the starboard tack,
\par and stood towards the brute, which was seen foaming and lashing the
\par water at a fearful rate. Upon the brig nearing, however, it disappeared,
\par and, though evidently wounded, made rapidly off at the rate of fifteen
\par or sixteen knots an hour, as was judged from its appearing several
\par times upon the surface. The Daphne pursued for some time; but
\par the night coming on, the master was obliged to put about and
\par continue his voyage.
\par From the description given by the mate, the brute must have been
\par nearly a hundred feet long, and his account of it agrees in every respect
\par with that lately forwarded to the Admiralty by the master of the Dcedalus.
\par JAMES HENDERSON, Master.
\par The account of the creature seen by the officers and crew
\par of the Dcedalus excited more than the usual attention given
\par to these stories ; for the professional status of the observers
\par guaranteed at once the veracity of their statement, and the
\par probability of their judgment being accurate. Considerable
\par correspondence ensued, including a very masterly attack
\par upon the identification of the creature by Professor Owen,
\par which will be again referred to further on. It also elicited
\par another sea-serpent story which appeared in the Bombay
\par Bi-monthly Times for January 1849.
\par I see, in your paper of the 30th of December, a paragraph in which
\par a doubt is expressed of the authenticity of the account given by
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 295
\par Captain M'Quhoe of the great
\par "
\par sea-serpent." When returning to
\par India, in the year 1829, I was standing on the poop of the Royal
\par Saxon, in conversation with Captain Petrie, the commander of that
\par ship. We were at a considerable distance south-west of the Cape of
\par Good Hope, in the usual track of vessels to this country, going
\par rapidly along (seven or eight knots) in fine smooth water. It was
\par in the middle of the day, and the other passengers were at luncheon,
\par the man at the wheel, a steerage passenger, and ourselves being the
\par only persons on the poop. Captain Petrie and myself, at the same
\par instant, were literally fixed in astonishment by the appearance, a short
\par distance ahead, of an animal of which no more generally correct
\par description could be given than that by Captain M'Quhce. It passed
\par within thirty-five yards of the ship without altering its course in the
\par least ; but as it came right abreast of us, it slowly turned its head
\par towards us. Apparently about one-third of the upper part of its body
\par was above water, in nearly its whole length ; and we could see the water
\par curling up on its breast as it moved along, but by what means it moved
\par we could not perceive. . . . We saw this apparently similar creature in
\par its whole length, with the exception of a small portion of the tail, which
\par was under water ; and by comparing its length with that of the Royal
\par Saxon (about six hundred feet) when exactly alongside in passing, we
\par calculated it to be in that, as well as its other dimensions, greater than
\par the animal described by Captain M'Quhce. I am not quite sure of our
\par latitude and longitude at the time, nor do I exactly remember the date,
\par but it was about the end of July.

\par Again, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Steele, of the Coldstream
\par Guards, wrote to the Zoologist :
\par " I have lately
\par received the following account from my brother, Captain
\par Steele, 9th Lancers, who, on his way out to India in the
\par Barham, saw the sea-serpent. Thinking it might be interesting
\par to you, as corroborating the account of the Dcedalus, I
\par have taken the liberty of sending you the extract from my
\par brother's letter :
\par ' On the 28th of August, in long. 40 E.,
\par lat. 37 16' S., about half-past two, we had all gone down
\par below to get ready for dinner, when the first mate called us
\par on deck to see a most extraordinary sight. About five hundred
\par yards from the ship there was the head and neck of an
\par 296 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par enormous snake ; we saw about sixteen or twenty feet out of
\par the water, and he spouted a long way from his head ; down
\par his back he had a crest like a cock's comb,* and was going
\par very slowly through the water, but left a wake of about fifty
\par or sixty feet, as if dragging a long body after him. The
\par captain put the ship off her course to run down to him, but
\par as we approached him he went down. His colour was green,
\par with light spots. He ivas seen by everyone on board.
\par 9 My
\par brother is no naturalist ; and I think this is the first time
\par the monster has ever been seen to spout."
\par One of the officers of the ship wrote :
\par " On looking over
\par the side of the vessel I saw a most wonderful sight, which I
\par shall recollect as long as I live. His head appeared to be
\par about sixteen feet above the water, and he kept moving it up
\par and down, sometimes showing his enormous neck, which was
\par surmounted with a huge crest in the shape of a saw. It
\par was surrounded by hundreds of birds, and we at first thought
\par it was a dead whale. He left a track in the water like the
\par wake of a boat, and from what we could see of his head and
\par part of his body, we were led to think he must be about
\par sixty feet in length, but he might be more. The captain
\par kept the vessel away to get nearer to him ; and when we
\par were within a hundred yards he slowly sank into the depths
\par of the sea. While we were at dinner he was seen again."
\par The Times, of Feb. 5, 1858, contains a statement made
\par by Captain Harrington, of the ship Castilian, and certified to
\par by his chief and second officers, as follows :
\par "Ship Castilian, Dec. 12, 1857; N.E. end of St. Helena,
\par distant ten miles. At 6.30 P.M., strong breezes and cloudy,
\par ship sailing about twelve miles per hour. While myself and
\par officers were standing on the leeside of the poop, looking
\par towards the island, we were startled by the sight of a huge
\par marine animal, which reared its head out of the water within
\par * How this reminds one of the Chinese dragon.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 297
\par twenty yards of the ship, when it suddenly disappeared for
\par about half a minute, and then made its appearance in the
\par same manner again, showing us distinctly its neck and head
\par about ten or twelve feet out of the water. Its head was
\par shaped like a long nun-buoy, and I suppose the diameter to
\par have been seven or eight feet in the largest part, with a kind
\par of scroll, or tuft of loose skin, encircling it about two feet
\par from the top ; the water was discoloured for several hundred
\par feet from its head, so much so that, on its first appearance,
\par my impression was that the ship was in broken water, produced,
\par as I supposed, by some volcanic agency since the last
\par time I had passed the island ; but the second appearance
\par completely dispelled those fears, and assured us that it was
\par a monster of extraordinary length, which appeared to be
\par moving slowly towards the land. The ship was going too
\par fast to enable us to reach the masthead in time to form a
\par correct estimate of its extreme length ; but from what we
\par saw from the deck, we conclude that it must have been over
\par two hundred feet long. The boatswain and several of the
\par crew who observed it from the topgallant forecastle, state
\par that it was more than double the length of the ship, in which
\par case it must have been five hundred feet. Be that as it may,
\par I am convinced that it belonged to the serpent tribe ; it was
\par of a dark colour about the head, and was covered with
\par several white spots."
\par A. writer in the New York Sun (I have the clipping, but,
\par unfortunately, not the date), discussing the best authenticated
\par stories, says :
\par " The Lynn sea-serpent appears to be
\par the most authentic, the writer having seen several persons
\par who saw it from the beach, and knowing others personally or
\par by reputation. The first animal of this kind seen about
\par Lynn was in 1638, and was seen by Dr. John Josselyn ; and
\par again another was observed, in 1819, by Mr. Cabot. Amos
\par Lawrance, one of the pillars of old Boston, said :
\par ' I have
\par never had any doubt of the existence of the sea-serpent
\par 298 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par since the morning he was seen off Nahant by old Marshal
\par Prince through his famous masthead spy-glass. For within
\par the next two hours I conversed with Samuel Cabot and
\par Daniel P. Parker, I think, and one or more persons besides,
\par who had spent a part of that morning in witnessing its
\par movements. In addition, Colonel Harris, the commander
\par at Fort Independence, told me that the creature had been
\par seen by a number of his soldiers while standing sentry at
\par early dawn, some time before this show at Nahant ; and
\par Colonel Harris believed it as firmly as though the creature
\par were drawn up before us in State Street, where we then
\par were.' Such is the history of the Lynn sea-serpent; and
\par the following is an extract from the report of the Linnasan
\par Society of Boston, made by Dr. Bigelow and F. C. Gray :
\par ' The monster was from eighty to ninety feet long ; his head
\par usually carried about two feet above the water ; the body of
\par a dark brown colour, with thirty or forty more protuberances,
\par compared by some to four-gallon kegs, by others to a string
\par of buoys, and called, by some, bunches on the back. Motions
\par very rapid faster than those of a whale ; swimming a mile
\par in three minutes, and sometimes more, leaving a wake
\par behind him ; chasing mackerel, herrings, and other fish,
\par which were seen jumping out of the water fifty at a time as
\par he approached. He only came to the surface of the sea in
\par calm and bright weather. A skilful gunner fired at him from
\par our boat, and, having taken good aim, felt sure he must have
\par hit him on the head. The creature turned towards him,
\par then dived under the boat, and reappeared a hundred yards
\par on the other side/ In February of 1846 a letter was printed
\par in the various newspapers, signed by Captain Lawson, giving
\par a description of a monstrous snake seen by him from his
\par vessel off Capes Charles and Henry. The length was stated
\par at one hundred feet, and on the back were seen sharp
\par projections. The head was small in proportion to the
\par length."
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 299
\par I next append a few short statements which have appeared
\par at various dates in the public prints.
\par The News of the World, Sept. 28, 1879, states that Captain
\par J. F. Cox, master of the British ship Privateer, which arrived
\par at Delaware breakwater on Sept. 9, from London, says :
\par " On
\par August 5, one hundred miles west of Brest (France), weather
\par fine and clear, at 5 P.M., as I was walking the quarter-deck,
\par I saw something black rise out of the water, about twenty
\par feet, in shape like an immense snake of three feet diameter.
\par It was about three hundred yards from the ship, coming
\par towards us. It turned its head partly from us, and went down
\par with a great splash, after staying up about five seconds, but
\par rose again three times at intervals of ten seconds, until it had
\par turned completely from us, and was going from us at a great
\par speed, and making the water boil all round it. I could see
\par its eyes and shape perfectly. It was like a great eel or snake,
\par but as black as coal tar, and appeared to be making great
\par exertions to get away from the ship. I have seen many
\par kinds of fish, in five different oceans, but was never favoured
\par with a sight of the great sea-snake before."
\par The Singapore Daily News, April 6, 1878, in its Australian
\par news quotes from Wellington (New Zealand), Feb. 26 (this
\par month corresponds with August north of the Line) :
\par " The
\par captain of the steamship Durham reports having seen a
\par monster serpent off Nerowas Island. Thirty feet of the
\par monster was visible out of the water. The crew and passengers
\par corroborate the report."
\par The Australian Sketcher for November 24, 1877, states :
\par "
\par Captain W. H. Nelson, of the American ship Sacramento,
\par which arrived in this port from New York on October 20,
\par reported that he saw the sea-serpent on his voyage. The
\par Argus paragraph on the subject stated :
\par * The date on which
\par the creature was seen was on July 30, the ship then being in
\par lat. 31 59' N. and long. 37 W. The man at the wheel was
\par the first to observe the monster, and he at once called Captain
\par 300 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Nelson, telling him what he saw ; but the latter, having the
\par same feeling of incredulity with regard to the sea-serpent as
\par most other people, did not hurry from below. On coming on
\par deck, however, he was rewarded with a distant glimpse of
\par the supposed sea-serpent, which the helmsman, for his part,
\par FIG. 71. SEA-SERPENT SEEN FROM THE SHIP " SACRAMENTO," JULY 30, 1877.
\par (From the " Australian Sketches")
\par declared he saw quite plainly. Some forty feet of the
\par monster was alleged to be observable. It appeared to be
\par about the size of a flour-barrel in girth, and its colour was
\par yellowish ; the head is described as being flat. The eyes
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 301
\par were plainly visible. Captain Nelson is convinced that what
\par he saw was some extraordinary marine monster.' We have
\par obtained from John Hart, the man at the wheel, a pencil
\par sketch of the creature, of which we give an engraving. The
\par sketch is accompanied with a further description, in which
\par the writer says :
\par ' This is a correct sketch of the sea-serpent
\par seen by me while on board the ship Sacramento, on her passage
\par from New York to Melbourne, I being at the wheel at
\par the time. It had the body of a very large snake ; its length
\par appeared to me to be about fifty feet or sixty feet. Its head was
\par like an alligator's, with a pair of flippers about ten feet from
\par its head. The colour was of a reddish brown. At the time
\par seen it was lying perfectly still, with its head raised about
\par three feet above the surface of the sea, and as it got thirty or
\par forty feet astern, it dropped its head.'
\par "
\par I confess that I do not attach much weight to this last
\par example, from the suspicious resemblance which the illustration
\par given in the Sketcher bears to an alligator, suggesting
\par that possibly such a creature may have been blown by winds
\par or carried by currents to the position where it was seen. It
\par is true that Mr. Gosse quotes the size of the largest alligator
\par on record as only seventeen feet and a half, whereas the estimated
\par length of the supposed sea-serpent in this instance was
\par from forty to sixty. But against that may be argued the
\par difficulty of estimating lengths or heights when you have
\par but a short inspection, and no object immediately near with
\par which to institute a comparison* ; while I am by no means
\par certain that Mr. Gosse 's maximum is correct. Dr. Dennys,
\par of Singapore, has assured me that some years back an alligator,

\par The Graphic of April 19th, 1879, contains a drawing of " a

\par of Aden, January 28th." The descriptive letter-press is as
\par follows :
\par " The following is an abstract of the account given by our

\par ADEN, JAN. 28, 1879. (From the Graphic" of April 19, 1879.)
\par our engraving is taken: ' On the 28th January 1879, at about
\par 10 A.M., I was on the poop deck of the steamship City of
\par Baltimore, in latitude 12 28' N., longitude 43 52' E. I
\par observed a long black object a-beam of the ship's stern on
\par the starboard side, at a distance of about three-quarters of a
\par mile, darting rapidly out of the water and splashing in again
\par with a noise distinctly audible, and advancing nearer and
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 303
\par nearer at a rapid pace. In a minute it had advanced to
\par within half-a-mile, and was distinctly recognisable as the
\par " veritable sea-serpent." I shouted out "
\par Sea-serpent ! seaserpent
\par ! Call the captain!" Dr. C. Hall, the ship's
\par surgeon, who was reading on deck, jumped up in time to see
\par the monster, as did also Miss Greenfield, one of the passengers
\par on board. By this time it was only about five hundred
\par yards off, and a little in the rear, owing to the vessel
\par then steaming at the rate of about ten knots an hour in a
\par westerly direction. On approaching the wake of the ship,
\par the serpent turned its course a little way, and was soon lost
\par to view in the blaze of sunlight reflected on the waves of the
\par sea. So rapid were its movements, that when it approached
\par the ship's wake, I seized a telescope, but could not catch
\par a view, as it darted rapidly out of the field of the glass before
\par I could see it. I was thus prevented from ascertaining
\par whether it had scales or not; but the best view of the
\par monster obtainable, when it was about three cables' length,
\par that is, about five hundred yards, distant, seemed to show
\par that it was without scales. I cannot, however, speak with
\par certainty. The head and neck, about two feet in diameter,
\par rose out of the water to a height of about twenty or thirty
\par feet, and the monster opened its jaws wide as it rose, and
\par closed them again as it lowered its head and darted forward
\par for a dive, reappearing almost immediately some hundred
\par yards ahead. The body was not visible at all, and must
\par have been some depth under water, as the disturbance on
\par the surface was too slight to attract notice, although occasionally
\par a splash was seen at some distance behind the head.
\par The shape of the head was not unlike pictures of the
\par dragon I have often seen, with a bull-dog appearance of the
\par forehead and eye-brow. When the monster had drawn its
\par head sufficiently out of the water, it let itself drop, as it were,
\par like a huge log of wood, prior to darting forward under the
\par water.'
\par "
\par 304 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Major Senior's statement is countersigned by the two
\par persons whom he mentions as co-witnesses.
\par When in Singapore, in 1880, I received the personal testimony
\par of Captain Anderson, at that time chief officer of the
\par Pluto (property of the Straits Government) and formerly a
\par commander in the P. and 0. Company's service.
\par Captain Anderson assured me that he had twice seen large
\par sea-serpents. Once off Ushant, when he was chief officer of
\par the Delta in 1861. No account was entered in the log nor
\par any notice sent to the newspapers, for fear of ridicule. On
\par that occasion the whole ship's company saw it ; it was five (?)
\par miles distant, and showed fifteen feet of its body out of the
\par water. It resembled a snake with a large fringe round the
\par neck. It appeared to be travelling, and moved its head to
\par and fro like a snake. It never spouted, and was observed
\par for a quarter of an hour.
\par The second occasion was in the Red Sea, when he was in
\par command of the Sumatra, on the outward trip in October or
\par November 1877. Off Mocha he saw an animal, five miles
\par distant, that lifted the body high out of the water like a
\par snake. All exclaimed,
\par " There is the sea-serpent !
\par "
\par but no
\par entry was made in the log, or report made of it. The same
\par creature was, however, seen shortly after by a man-of-war
\par close to Suez and reported.
\par In 1881 I once more had the personal testimony of an
\par eye-witness.
\par Mr. J. H. Hoar, of the pilot station, Shanghai, China,
\par informed me that he saw a sea-serpent some years previously,
\par when he was stationed at Ningpo, on the China coast-line,
\par a little south of the embouchure of the Yangtse-kiang. He
\par was at the time on the look-out for a vessel, from the top of
\par the bank of Lowchew Island, Chinsang, on the southern side
\par of the island fronting the six-mile passage. This island lies
\par east of Worth Point. The hill he was on was about one
\par hundred and fifty feet high, the snake distant about two
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 305
\par hundred and fifty yards, the depth of water seven fathoms.
\par His attention was directed to it by a group of Chinamen
\par calling out "
\par She," which means " snake." He saw it lying on
\par the surface of the water, resembling two masts of a junk end
\par to end, but with a slight interval. Presently it rose slightly,
\par and then appeared all in one, extended flat upon the surface
\par of the water. He examined it with his glass, and noticed the
\par eye, which appeared to be as big as a coffee saucer, and slate -
\par coloured. The head was flat on the top. He estimated the
\par length at from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and
\par forty feet.
\par He learned that it was the third occasion of its being seen
\par in that place within eight years. An account was published
\par in one of the local journals, by Mr. Sloman, from the statements
\par of the Chinese observers. Mr. Hoar was prevented
\par from doing the same by the fear of being ridiculed. I may
\par note that there is a bay, not far from this spot, among the
\par Chusan islands, which has long been credited with being the
\par abode of a great sea-dragon, and in passing over which junks
\par take certain superstitious precautions.
\par I have little doubt of the identity of the sea-serpent with
\par the sea-dragon of the Chinese. Dr. Dennys* says :
\par " Of
\par course our old friend, the sea-serpent, turns up on the coasts
\par of China, and the description of him does not greatly differ
\par from that recorded elsewhere. According to a popular legend,
\par the Chien Tang river was at one time infested by a great kiau
\par or sea-serpent, and in 1129 A.D., a district graduate is said
\par to have heroically thrown himself into the flood to encounter
\par and destroy the monster. It has been already noted that
\par most of the river gods are supposed to appear in the form of
\par water-snakes, and that the sea-serpents noticed in Chinese
\par records have always infested the mouths of rivers."
\par The Rev. Mr. Butler, of the Presbyterian Mission in Ningpo,
\par * Folklore of China, p. 113.
\par 20
\par 306 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par informed me that a dragon which threatened boats was supposed
\par by the Chinese to infest a narrow passage called Quo
\par Mung, outside of Chinaye. Formerly there were two of them
\par in the neighbourhood, which were very furious, and frequently
\par upset boats. They had to be appeased by a yearly offering
\par of a girl of fair appearance and perfect body. At last, one of
\par the literati determined to stop this. He armed himself, and
\par jumped into the water ; blood rose to the surface. He had
\par killed one of the dragons. The other retired to the narrow
\par place. A temple was erected to the hero at Peach Blossom
\par ferry.
\par It may be noted that both the Malays and the Chinese
\par attribute the origin of ambergris to either a sea-dragon or a
\par sea-serpent. Thus, in the description of Ambergris Island or
\par Dragon Spittle Island, contained in the History of the Ming
\par Dynasty, Book 325, from which an extract is given (in translation)
\par by Mr. W. P. Groeneveldt, in his Notes on the Malay
\par Archipelago and Malacca, compiled from Chinese sources,*
\par we find it stated that " this island has the appearance of a
\par single mountain, and is situated in the Sea of Lambri, at a
\par distance of one day and one night from Sumatra. It rises
\par abruptly out of the sea, which breaks on it with high waves."
\par "
\par Every spring numerous dragons come together to play
\par on this island, and they leave behind their spittle. The
\par natives afterwards go in canoes to the spot and collect this
\par spittle, which they take with them.
\par " The dragon-spittle is at first like fat, of a black and
\par yellow colour, and with a fishy smell ; by length of time it
\par contracts into large lumps ; and these are also found in the
\par belly of a large fish, of the size of the Chinese peck, and
\par also with a fishy smell. When burnt it has a pure and
\par delicious fragrance.

\par " It is sold in the market of Sumatra, one tael, official
\par weight, costing twelve golden coins of that country, and one
\par cati,* one hundred and ninety -two of such pieces, equal to
\par about nine thousand Chinese copper cash ; and so it is not
\par very cheap."
\par Dr. F. Porter Smithf states that there can be no doubt
\par that the costly, odorous, light yellow, gummy substance,
\par found floating on the sea, or procured from the belly of some
\par large fish in the Indian Ocean, and known by the Chinese
\par of the present day as lung sin, or dragon's spittle, is actually
\par ambergris. The dragon is said to cough it up.

\par Canton and Foochow in former days, is said to be the egg of
\par the dragon or a kind of sea-serpent named kih tiau. The
\par name kih tiau is singularly like the Greek name for a seamonster."

\par be glad to hear that the passengers and officers of the S.S.
\par 'Nestor, which arrived here this morning, are unanimous in
\par the conclusion, and vouch for the fact, that an extraordinary
\par sea-monster was seen by them between Malacca and Penang
\par on their voyage to this port, on Monday, about noon. It was
\par about two hundred and fifty feet long, about fifty feet broad,
\par square -headed, with black and yellow stripes, closely
\par resembling a salamander."
\par This was followed, on the succeeding day, by a letter from
\par the captain.
\par SIR, In reference to your paragraph in your yesterday's issue, relating
\par to our having seen a sea-monster answering to the popular notion
\par of a sea-serpent, I am prepared to vouch for the correctness of the
\par statement already made to you by the doctor and a passenger by my
\par ship.
\par Being on the bridge at the time (about 10 A.M.) with the first and
\par third officers, we were surprised by the appearance of an extraordinary
\par monster going in our course, and at an equal speed with the vessel, at
\par a distance from us of about six hundred feet. It had a square head and
\par a dragon black and white striped tail, and an immense body, which was
\par quite fifty feet broad when the monster raised it. The head was about
\par twelve feet broad, and appeared to be occasionally, at the extreme,
\par about six feet above the water. When the head was placed on a level
\par with the water, the body was extended to its utmost limit to all
\par appearance, and then the body rose out of the water about two feet, and
\par seemed quite fifty feet broad at those times. The long dragon tail with
\par black and white scales afterwards rose in an undulating motion, in
\par which at one time the head, at another the body, and eventually the
\par tail, formed each in its turn a prominent object above the water.
\par The animal, or whatever it may be called, appeared careless of our
\par proximity, and went our course for about six minutes on our starboard
\par side, and then finally worked round to our port side, and remained in
\par view, to the delight of all on board, for about half an hour. His length
\par was reckoned to be over two hundred feet.

\par but he still insisted on its publication. It was confirmed by
\par Mr. H. K. Beaver, a merchant of Singapore, and other
\par persons who were passengers by the boat.

\par very extensively when
\par he reaches a berth in London Docks. A genuine sea-serpent
\par is not met with every day, and as the observations made by

\par to pursue their researches when the captain arrives. Competent
\par authorities are now of opinion that the part of the
\par monster formerly supposed to have been its head, must have
\par been a hump ; and that its head's being under water would
\par account for the supreme contempt with which it treated the
\par passage of the steamer. The undulating motion of the huge
\par animal would explain the statement that this knob or hump
\par rose occasionally about six feet out of the water. The alternate
\par yellow and black stripes which covered all that could be
\par seen of the body, appear to have conveyed the impression
\par that the tail was like that of a dragon covered with scales,
\par although that conclusion need not necessarily be looked upon
\par as certain. If the head of this unknown (
\par shape
\par ' was actually
\par under water, then the length becomes proportionately greater.
\par It was over two hundred feet long before, it must now be
\par regarded as measuring, say, two hundred and fifty feet, which,
\par with forty-five or fifty feet beam, gives a leviathan of something
\par like the dimensions of an old-fashioned frigate."
\par A correspondent of the Celestial Empire, of Shanghai, wrote
\par thus to the journal :
\par SIR, If it is true that one of those who observed the marine monster
\par from the Nestor is still here, it is very desirable that he should give
\par 310 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par some fuller account of what he saw. Only a sciolist will deny the possibility
\par of such a beast, and Professor Owen himself has remarked that
\par the only absolutely incredible part of the accounts of those who have
\par seen it, is the statement of its vertical sinuosity, which is impossible to
\par any of the serpent tribe.
\par The monster seen by the Nestor, however, was probably one of the
\par Chelonidse,
\par " the father of all the turtles," as he is fitly called by the
\par natives of Sumatra, who fully believe in his existence, and to whom he
\par occasionally appears. Indeed, Baumgarten, in his Malaysi&n, published
\par at Amsterdam in 1829, describes the monster, and estimates its length
\par and breadth at one hundred and twenty and thirty cubits respectively,
\par measurements which agree very nearly with those given by Captain
\par Webster. Baumgarten* adds that it is a general belief in Sumatra
\par (vol. ii. p. 321, Ed. 1820), that whosoever sees him will die within the
\par year.
\par "
\par This," he says naively enough,
\par " I have not been able to
\par prove."
\par Mr. David Aitken, of Singapore, wrote to the Daily Times
\par as follows :
\par DEAK SIB, Like many others, I have been astonished at the dimensions
\par given by you of the sea-serpent. They are certainly enormous,
\par and they far surpass anything I have ever seen or heard of. The largest
\par snake ever I authentically heard about was one which passed between
\par the surveying brigs Krishna and Menx when under the command of
\par Lieutenant Ward, of the Indian Navy, when surveying off the coast of
\par Sumatra, about the years 1858 and 1859. This monster passed by the
\par brigs one Sunday morning when they were moored somewhere opposite
\par Malacca. Its length was variously estimated at from the length of the
\par Krishna to one hundred feet. Sixty feet was the moderate length set
\par down for its frame.
\par In or near the same place, another monster had been seen by a
\par previous surveying party.
\par Mr. Stephen Cave, M.P. for Shoreham, in 1861, communicated
\par to Mr. Gosse a short statement, which throws some
\par light upon the food of the monster. It is in the form of an
\par \\
\par * I must also add, on the information of Mr. H. C. Syers, of
\par Selangor, that Captain Douglas, late Resident of Perak, had a large seaserpent
\par rise close to him, somewhere off Perak, when in a boat manned
\par by Malays. Mr. Syers had the account both from Captain Douglas and
\par from the cr.ew ; and he tells me that there is a universal belief in the
\par existence of some large sea- monster among the Malays of the western
\par coast of the Peninsula.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 311
\par extract from his journal written during a voyage to the West
\par Indies, in 1846, as follows :
\par "
\par Thursday, December 10, off Madeira, on board K.M.S.
\par Thomas, made acquaintance with a Captain Christmas, of the
\par Danish Navy, a proprietor in Santa Cruz, and holding some
\par office about the Danish court. He told me he once saw a
\par sea-serpent between Iceland and the Faroe islands. He was
\par lying-to in a gale of wind, in a frigate of which he had the
\par command, when an immense shoal of porpoises rushed by the
\par ship as if pursued ; and, lo and behold, a creature with a neck
\par moving like that of a swan, about the thickness of a man's
\par waist, with a head like a horse, raised itself slowly and gracefully
\par from the deep, and, seeing the ship, it immediately disappeared
\par again, head foremost, like a duck diving. He only
\par saw it for a few seconds. The part above the water seemed
\par about eighteen feet in length. He is a singularly intelligent
\par man, and by no means one to allow his imagination to run
\par away with him."
\par Witty journalists had a good time over the publication of
\par the story of the serpent seen by Captain Drevar, with which
\par I shall wind up my list of apparitions. As will be seen,
\par however, the captain stuck manfully to his guns, and I, for
\par one, am of the belief that he really saw the incident which he
\par narrates. I have not met the captain himself, but I did, in
\par Singapore, meet with many who had heard the whole story
\par from his own lips, and whose impression was that he was a
\par truthful man.

\par To the Editor of the Calcutta Englishman.
\par SIR, As I am not sure that my statement respecting the sea-serpent
\par reached the Shipping Gazette in London, I enclose a copy that may be
\par interesting to your numerous readers. I have been sent plenty of
\par extracts from English papers, nearly all of them ridiculing my statement.
\par I can laugh and joke on the subject as well as anyone, but I

\par If the writer knew anything of sailors, he would not write

\par described, as that I met the advertisement that the Telegraph has
\par the largest circulation in the world staring me at every street corner in
\par London. It is easy for such a paper to make any man, good, great, or

\par and a similar one rose. They rose and fell alternately in quick succession,
\par and good glasses showed me it was a monster sea-serpent coiled
\par twice round a large sperm whale. The head and tail parts, each about
\par thirty feet long, were acting as levers, twisting itself and victim around
\par with great velocity. They sank out of sight about every two minutes,

\par minutes, and finished with the tail portion of the whale being elevated
\par straight in the air, then waving backwards and forwards, and laving
\par [lashing?] the water furiously in the last death-struggle, when the
\par whole body disappeared from our view, going down head-foremost
\par towards the bottom, where, no doubt, it was gorged at the serpent's
\par leisure ; and that monster of monsters may have been many months in
\par a state of coma, digesting the huge mouthful. Then two of the largest
\par sperm whales that I have ever seen moved slowly thence towards the vessel,
\par their bodies more than usually elevated out of the water, and not
\par spouting or making the least noise, but seeming quite paralysed with
\par fear ; indeed, a cold shiver went through my own frame on beholding
\par the last agonising struggle of the poor whale that had seemed as helpless
\par in the coils of the vicious monster as a small bird in the talons of

\par was about one hundred and sixty or one hundred and seventy feet long,

\par attracted its attention While thus thinking, I was startled by
\par the cry of "There it is agaio," and a short distance to leeward,

\par GEORGE DREVAR,
\par Master of the Pauline.
\par Chittagong, January 15, 1876.
\par Captain George Drevar, of the barque Pauline, appeared on Wednesday
\par morning at the Police-court, Dale- street, before Mr. Baffles,
\par stipendiary magistrate, accompanied by some of his officers and part
\par of the crew of the barque, when they made the following declaration
\par :
\par "We, the undersigned, captain, officers, and crew of the barque
\par Pauline, of London, do solemnly and sincerely declare that on July
\par 8th, 1875, in latitude 5 13', longitude 35 W., we observed three large
\par sperm whales, and one of them was gripped round the body with two
\par turns of what appeared to be a large serpent. The head and tail
\par appeared to have a length beyond the coils of about thirty feet, and its
\par girth eight or nine feet. The serpent whirled its victim round and
\par round for about fifteen minutes, and then suddenly dragged the whale
\par to the bottom, head first.

\par " HORATIO THOMPSON,
\par " HENDERSON LANDELLO,
\par " OWEN BAKER,
\par " WILLIAM LEWAN.
\par "
\par Again, on July 13th, a similar serpent was seen about two hundred
\par yards off, shooting itself along the surface, head and neck being out of
\par the water several feet. This was seen only by the captain and one
\par ordinary seaman.
\par " GEORGE DREVAR, Master.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 3l5
\par " A few moments after, it was seen elevated some sixty feet perpendicularly
\par in the air by the chief officer and the following able seamen,
\par Horatio Thompson, Owen Baker, William Lewan. And we make this
\par solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true.
\par " GEORGE DREVAR, Master.
\par " WILLIAM LEWAN, Steward.
\par " HORATIO THOMPSON, Chief Officer,
\par " JOHN HENDERSON LANDELLO, 2nd Officer,
\par " OWEN BAKER."
\par Some confirmation of Captain Drevar's story is afforded by
\par one quoted by the Eev. Henry T. Cheeves, in The Whale
\par and his Captors. The author says :
\par " From a statement made by a Kinebeck shipmaster in
\par 1818, and sworn to before a justice of the peace in Kinebeck
\par county, Maine, it would seem that the notable sea-serpent
\par and whale are sometimes found in conflict. At six o'clock
\par in the afternoon of June 21st, in the packet Delia, plying
\par between Boston and Hallowell, when Cape Ann bore westsouth-
\par west about two miles, steering north-north-east,
\par Captain Shuback West and fifteen others on board with him
\par saw an object directly ahead, which he had no doubt was
\par the sea-serpent, or the creature so often described under that
\par name, engaged in fight with a large whale
\par " The serpent threw up its tail from twenty-five to thirty
\par feet in a perpendicular direction, striking the whale by it with
\par tremendous blows, rapidly repeated, which were distinctly
\par heard, and very loud, for two or three minutes ; they then
\par both disappeared, moving in a south-west direction ; but after
\par a few minutes reappeared in-shore of the packet, and about
\par under the sun, the reflection of which was so strong as to
\par prevent their seeing so distinctly as at first, when the serpent's
\par fearful blows with his tail were repeated and clearly
\par heard as before. They again went down for a short time,
\par and then came up to the surface under the packet's larboard
\par quarter, the whale appearing first, and the serpent in pursuit,
\par who was again seen to shoot up his tail as before, which
\par 316 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par he held out of water for some time, waving it in the air
\par before striking, and at the same time his head fifteen or
\par twenty feet, as if taking a view of the surface of the sea.
\par After being seen in this position a few minutes, the serpent
\par and whale again disappeared, and neither was seen after by
\par any on board. It was Captain West's opinion that the

\par whale was trying to escape, as he spouted but once at a time
\par on coming to the surface, and the last time he appeared he
\par went down before the serpent came up."
\par A remarkable and independent corroboration of modern
\par date comes from the Japan seas. It was reported both in
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 317
\par local papers and in the San Francisco Californian Mail-Bag
\par for 1879, from which I extract the notice and the illustrative
\par cuts (Fig. 75).
\par " The accompanying engravings are fac-similes of a sketch
\par sent to us by Captain Davidson, of the steamship Kiushiumaru,*
\par and is inserted as a specimen of the curious drawings
\par which are frequently forwarded to us for insertion. Captain
\par Davidson's statement, which is countersigned by his chief
\par officer, Mr. McKechnie, is as follows :
\par " '
\par Saturday, April 5th, at 11.15 A.M., Cape Satano distant
\par about nine miles, the chief officer and myself observed a
\par whale jump clear out of the sea, about a quarter of a mile
\par away.
\par " *
\par Shortly after it leaped out again, when I saw there
\par was something attached to it. Got glasses, and on the next
\par leap distinctly saw something holding on to the belly of the
\par whale. The latter gave one more spring clear of the water,
\par and myself and chief officer then observed what appeared to
\par be a creature of the snake species rear itself about thirty feet
\par out of the water. It appeared to be about the thickness of a
\par junk's mast, and after standing about ten seconds in an
\par erect position, it descended into the water, the upper end
\par going first. With my glasses I made out the colour of the
\par beast to resemble that of a pilot fish."
\par There is an interesting story f of a fight between a water -
\par snake and a trout, by Mr. A. W. Chase, Assistant United
\par States Coast Survey, which, magnis componere parva, may be
\par accepted as an illustration of how a creature of serpentine
\par form would have to deal with a whale ; only, as on the surface
\par or in mid-water it would be prevented from grasping any
\par rocks by which to anchor itself, we may readily conceive it
\par * This is one of the fleet of the important Japanese Mitsu Bish

\par holding on with a tenacious grip of its extended jaws, and
\par drawing itself up to the enemy until it could either embrace
\par it in its coils or stun it with violent blows of the tail.*
\par " The trout, at first sight, was lying in mid-water, heading
\par up stream. It was, as afterwards appeared, fully nine inches
\par in length This new enemy of the trout was a large
\par water-snake of the common variety, striped black and yellow.
\par He swam up the pool on the surface until over the trout,
\par when he made a dive, and by a dexterous movement seized
\par the trout in such a fashion that the jaws of the snake closed
\par its mouth. The fight then commenced. The trout had the
\par use of its tail and fins, and could drag the snake from the
\par surface ; when near the bottom, however, the snake made use
\par of its tail by winding it round every stone or root that it
\par could reach. After securing this tail-hold, it could drag the
\par trout towards the bank, but on letting go the trout would
\par have a new advantage. This battle was continued for full
\par twenty minutes, when the snake managed to get its tail out
\par of the water and clasped around the root of one of the
\par willows mentioned as overhanging the pool. The battle was
\par then up, for the snake gradually put coil after coil around
\par the root, with each one dragging the fish toward the land.
\par When half its body was coiled it unloosed the first hold,
\par and stretched the end of its tail out in every direction,
\par and finding another root, made fast ; and now, using both,
\par dragged the trout on the gravel bank. It now had it under
\par control, and, uncoiling, the snake dragged the fish fully
\par ten feet up on the bank, and, I suppose would have gorged
\par him," &c. &c.
\par * It must be remembered that it is with a blow of its powerful tail
\par that the alligator stuns its prey and knocks it into the water (when any
\par stray animal approaches the bank), and it is with the tail that the
\par dragon, in the fable related by Julian, chastises, although gently,
\par its mistress, and constricts, according to Pliny, the elephant in its
\par folds.
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 319
\par Captain Drevar follows Pontoppidan (probably unwittingly)
\par in identifying the sea-serpent with the leviathan of
\par Scripture, quoting Isaiah xxvii. 1,
\par " In that day the Lord
\par with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish
\par leviathan, the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked
\par serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the
\par sea." As I read the above passage, it is the dragon that
\par is in the sea, and not the leviathan, which should be
\par identified with the sea-serpent, unless the two, dragon
\par and leviathan, are in apposition, which does not seem to
\par be the case.
\par These various narratives which I have collected are, for
\par the most part, well attested by the signature, or declaration
\par on oath, of well-known and responsible people. Captain
\par Drevar, in the small pamphlet which he had printed for
\par private circulation, says :
\par " Does any thinking person
\par imagine I could keep command over men with a deliberate lie
\par in our mouths ?
\par "
\par and a similar question may be asked, with,
\par I think, the possibility of only one reply, in the case of the
\par narratives of Captain M'Quhce and other officers and commanders
\par in various navies and merchant vessels, and of the
\par numerous other reputable witnesses who have affirmed,
\par either as a simple statement or on oath, that they have seen
\par sundry remarkable sea-monsters. I used the expression,
\par "I think," because, of course, there is the possibility of
\par scepticism.
\par "
\par Authority, in matters of opinion, divides itself (say) into
\par three principal classes : there is the authority of witnesses ;
\par they testify to matters of fact. The judgment upon these is
\par commonly, though not always, easy ; but this testimony is
\par always the substitution of the faculties of others for our
\par own, which, taken largely, constitutes the essence of
\par authority.
\par " This is the kind which we justly admit with the smallest
\par jealousy. Yet not always ; one man admits, another refuses,
\par 320 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par the authority of a sea-captain and a sailor or two on the
\par existence of a sea-serpent."
\par *
\par I, for my part, belong to the former of these two categories.
\par I believe in the statements that I have recorded, and in the
\par following reasoning address only those who do likewise.
\par That mistakes have occasionally occurred is undoubted.
\par Mr. Gosse records two instances in which long patches of
\par sea-weed so far excited the imagination of captains of
\par vessels as to cause them to lower boats and proceed to the
\par attack.
\par The credibility of ghost stories generally is much affected
\par when supposed apparitions are investigated and traced to
\par some simple cause ; and the hypersceptical may argue on
\par parallel grounds that the transformation, in some few
\par instances, of a supposed sea-serpent into sea-weed, or the
\par admission of the plausible suggestion that it has been simulated
\par by a seal, a string of porpoises, or some other very
\par ordinary animals, largely affects the whole question.
\par And this would undoubtedly be the case if the conditions
\par of the several examples were at all similar. But the hesitation
\par or temporary misapprehension of captains or crews, in a
\par thousand instances, as to the nature of a string of weed,
\par supine on the surface, and lashed into fantastic motion by
\par the surge of the ocean waves, has absolutely no bearing on
\par the positive stories of a creature which is seen in calm fjords
\par and bays to roll itself coil after coil, uplift its head high
\par above the water, exhibit capacious jaws armed with teeth,
\par conspicuous eyes, and paws or paddles, which pursues and
\par menaces boats, presents a tangible object to a marksman,
\par and when struck disappears with a mighty splash.
\par The probability of a gigantic seal, or of a string of por-

\par poises, being mistaken for a sea-serpent by post-captains
\par and their officers in the Navy is small, but becomes almost,
\par if not quite, impossible when the observers are fishermen on
\par coasts like those of Norway, who have been in the habit of
\par seeing seals and porpoises almost every day of their lives.
\par We may, therefore, freely grant that occasional mistakes
\par have arisen, just as we have admitted that undoubtedly
\par many hoaxes have been indulged in.
\par A rational and commonplace explanation is quite possible
\par in some cases, as, for example, in that of a creature of
\par abnormal appearance seen by the crew of Her Majesty's
\par yacht, the Osborne, in the Mediterranean, which was suggested,
\par with great probability, to have been, if I remember
\par correctly, some species of shark; while the supposed seaserpent,
\par washed up on the Isle of Stronsa, in 1808, proved,
\par on scientific examination, to be a shark of the genus Selache,
\par probably belonging to the species known as " the barking
\par shark.""
\par The great oceanic bone shark, known to few except whalers,
\par which has been stated to reach as much as sixty feet in
\par length, may also occasionally have originated a misconception
\par ; and there must be still remaining in the depths of the
\par ocean undescribed species of fish, of bizarre form, and probably
\par gigantic size, the occasional appearance of which would
\par puzzle an observer.
\par For example, in November 1879, an illustration was given
\par in the Graphic of " another marine monster," professing to
\par be a sketch in the Gulf of Suez from H.M.S. Philomel, accompanied
\par by the following descriptive letter-press :
\par "This strange monster," says Mr. W. J. Andrews,
\par Assistant Paymaster, H.M.S. Philomel,
\par " was seen by the
\par officers and ship's company of this ship at about 5.30 P.M.
\par on October 14, when in the gulf of Suez, Cape Zafarana

\par 322 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par " When first observed it was rather more than a mile
\par distant on the port bow, its snout projecting from the surface
\par of the water, and strongly marked ripples showing the position
\par of the body. It then opened its jaws, as shown in the
\par sketch, and shut them again several times, forcing the water
\par from between them as it did so in all directions in large jets.
\par From time to time a portion of the back and dorsal fin
\par appeared at some distance from the head. After remaining
\par some little time in the above-described position, it dis-
\par FIG. 76. ANOTHER MARINE MONSTER. A Sketch in the Gulf of Suez, from

\par Philomel," Oct. 14, 1879. (From the "
\par Graphic," Nov. 1879.)
\par appeared, and on coming to the surface again it repeated the
\par action of elevating the head and opening the jaws several
\par times, turning slowly from side to side as it did so.
\par " On the approach of the ship the monster swam swiftly
\par away, leaving a broad track like the wake of a ship, and disappeared
\par beneath the waves.
\par " The colour of that portion of the body that was seen was
\par black, as was also the upper jaw. The lower jaw was grey
\par round the mouth, but of a bright salmon colour underneath,
\par like the belly of some kinds of lizard, becoming redder as it
\par approached the throat. The inside of the mouth appeared to
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 323
\par be grey with white stripes, parallel to the edges of the jaw,
\par very distinctly marked. These might have been rows of
\par teeth or of some substance resembling whalebone. The
\par height the snout was elevated above the surface of the
\par water was at least fifteen feet, and the spread of the jaws
\par quite twenty-five feet."
\par Strangely enough, a proximate counterpart of this fish,
\par but of mimic size, was made known to science in 1882. My
\par attention was called by Mr. Streich, of the German Consulate
\par in Shanghai, to a description of this in the Daheim, an

\par figure, from which I inferred that the monster seen by
\par the crew of the Philomel was only a gigantic and adult specimen
\par of a species belonging to the same order, perhaps to
\par the same genus, as the Eurypharynx, adapted to live in the
\par depths of the ocean, and only appearing upon the surface

\par "A New Fish.*
\par " The deep-sea explorations of last year, which extended
\par over eight thousand metres in depth, brought to light some
\par very extraordinary animals, of which, up to the present date,
\par we have no idea. The most curious one was found by the
\par French steamer Le Travailleur, on which there was a staff of
\par naturalists, and of the number was M. Milne Edwards. They
\par were entirely devoted to deep-sea dredging.
\par " Between Morocco and the Canary Islands, at two thousand
\par three hundred metres depth, the dredge caught a most
\par wonderful animal, which at the first glance nobody thought

\par to be a fish. This fish, of which we give here a picture,
\par dwells on the bottom of the sea where the water is +5
\par Celsius,* in a kind of red slime composed of the shells of
\par small Globigerinse. On account of its curious mouth it has
\par been called Eurypharynx Pelicanoides, i.e. the Pelican-like
\par Broad-jaws. This creature is distinguished from all its class
\par by the peculiar construction of its mouth, its under jaw being
\par of a structure different from that of any other fish, possessing
\par only two small teeth and a big pouch of most expansible
\par FIG. 77. EURYIMIAIIYNX PELIOANOIDKS. (From, the Daheim.')
\par skin, similar to the sac which a pelican has on its under jaw.
\par In this sac it (the Broad-jaw) collects its food, and as its
\par stomach is of very small dimensions, we may, from analogy
\par with other fishes, conclude that it digests partly in this
\par sac.
\par " The swimming apparatus of this fish is not much developed,
\par and reduced to a number of spines erect from the back
\par and the belly.

\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 325
\par " The pectoral fins, which are immediately behind the
\par eye, are also very small, so that we may conclude from
\par this that this fish does not move much, and is not a good
\par swimmer.
\par " It only inhabits the bottom of the sea. Its body
\par decreases gradually backwards till it finishes in a string-like
\par tail. The organs for breathing are not much developed.
\par Six slits (gill apertures ?) allow the water to enter.
\par " The colour of the fish (the size of which we do not find
\par in our authority) is velvet black."
\par Before proceeding further I must point out that we may
\par dismiss from our minds the possibility of the so-called seaserpent
\par being merely a large example of those marine serpents
\par of which several species and numerous individuals are
\par known to exist on the coast of many tropical countries, for
\par these are rarely more than from four to six feet in length,
\par although Dampier* mentions one which he saw on the
\par northern coast of Australia, which was long (but the length
\par is not specified) and as big as a man's leg. He gives a
\par curious instance of these biters being bit, which he observed
\par not far from Scoutens Island, off New Guinea :
\par " On the 23rd we saw two snakes, and the next morning
\par another passing by us, which was furiously assaulted by two
\par fishes that had kept in company five or six days. They were
\par shaped like mackerel, and were about that bigness and
\par length, and of a yellow-greenish colour. The snake swam
\par away from them very fast, keeping his head above water.
\par The fish snapped at his tail ; but when he turned himself
\par that fish would withdraw and another would snap ; so that
\par by turns they kept him employed. Yet he still defended
\par himself, and swam away at a great pace, till they were out of
\par sight."

\par Leguat* speaks of a marine serpent, over sixty pounds in
\par weight, which he and his comrades in misfortune captured
\par and tasted, when marooned by order of the Governor of
\par the Mauritius on some small island off the harbour, about six
\par miles from the shore. He says :
\par 66 It was a frightful sea-serpent, which we in our great
\par simplicity took for a large lamprey or eel. This animal
\par seemed to us very extraordinary, for it had fins, and we knew
\par not that there were any such creatures as sea-serpents.
\par Moreover, we had been so accustomed to discover creatures
\par that were new to us, both at land and at sea, that we did not
\par think this to be any other than an odd sort of eel that we
\par never had seen before, yet which we could not but think
\par more resembled a snake than an eel. In a word, the monster
\par had a serpent or crocodile's head, and a mouth full of hooked,
\par long and sharp teeth When our purveyors came we
\par related to them what had happened to us, and showed them
\par the eel's head, but they only said they had never seen the
\par like.
\par 5 '
\par In spite of Leguat's impression, I think it was only some
\par species of conger eel.
\par Marine serpents are abundant on the Malay coast, and
\par particularly so in the Indian Ocean. Niebuhr says :
\par " In the Indian Ocean, at a certain distance from land, a
\par great many water-serpents, from twelve to fifteen inches in
\par length, are to be seen rising above the surface of the water.
\par When these serpents are seen they are an indication that the
\par coast is exactly two degrees distant. We saw some of these
\par serpents, for the first time, on the evening of the 9th of
\par September; on the llth we landed in the harbour of
\par Bombay." f

\par f I find the following note in Maclean's Guide to Bombay, for 1883 :
\par " Since the first edition of this Gazette was published, Captain Dundas,
\par of the P. and O. Company's steamer Cathay, has informed me that the
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 327
\par These sea-snakes are reputed to be mostly, if not entirely,
\par venomous. Their motion in the water is by undulation in
\par a horizontal, not in a vertical, direction ; they breathe with
\par lungs ; their home is on the surface, and they would perish
\par if confined for any considerable period beneath it.
\par FIG. 78. SCOLIOPHIS ATLANTICUS. Killed on the Sea-shore near Boston, in 1817, and

\par It is an open question whether conger eels may not exist,
\par in the ocean depths, of far greater dimensions than those of
\par the largest individuals with which we are acquainted. Major
\par Wolf, who was stationed at Singapore while I was there in
\par 1880, gave me information which seems to corroborate this
\par idea. He stated that when dining some years before with a
\par retired captain of the 39th Regiment, then resident at
\par Wicklow, the latter informed him that, having upon one
\par occasion gone to the coast with his servant in attendance on
\par him, the latter asked permission to cease continuing on with
\par the captain in order that he might bathe. Having received
\par permission, he proceeded to do so, and swam out beyond
\par the edge of the shallow water into the deep. A coastguardsman,
\par who was watching him from the cliff above, was horrified
\par to see something like a huge fish pursuing the man
\par after he had turned round towards the shore. He was afraid
\par to call out lest the man should be perplexed. The man,
\par statements of old travellers regarding these serpents are quite accurate.
\par The serpents are not seen excepting during the south-west monsoon
\par the season in which alone voyages used to be made to India. In Horsburgh's
\par Sailing Directions, shipmasters are warned to look out for the
\par serpents, whose presence is a sign that the ship is close to land. Captain
\par Dundas says that the serpents are yellow or copper-coloured. The
\par largest ones are farthest out to sea. They lie on the surface of the
\par water, and appear too lazy even to get out of a steamer's way.
\par 328 MYTHICAL MONSTEKS.
\par however, heard some splash or noise behind him, and looked
\par round and saw a large head, like a bull-dog's head, projecting
\par out of the water as if to seize him. He made a frantic
\par rush shoreways, and striking the shallow ground, clambered
\par out as quickly as possible, but broke one of his toes from the
\par violence with which he struck the ground. This story was
\par confirmed by a Mr. Burbidge, a farmer, who stated that on
\par one occasion when he himself was bathing within a mile or
\par so of the same spot, the water commenced swirling around
\par him, and that, being alarmed, he swam rapidly in, and was
\par pursued by something perfectly corresponding with that
\par described by the other narrator, and which he supposed to
\par be a large conger eel. In each case the length was estimated
\par at twenty feet. Mr. Gosse gives the greatest length recorded
\par at ten feet.
\par Were we only acquainted with a small and certain
\par proportion of the sea-serpent stories, we might readily
\par imagine that they had been originated by a sight of
\par some monstrous conger, but there are details exhibited
\par by them, taken as a whole, which forbid that idea. We
\par must therefore search elsewhere for the affinities of the seaserpent.
\par And first as to those authorities who believe and who disbelieve
\par in its existence.
\par Professor Owen, in 1848, attacked the Dcedalus story in
\par a very masterly manner, and extended his arguments so as
\par to embrace the general non -probability of other stories which
\par had previously affirmed it. He was, in fact, its main scientific
\par opponent.
\par Sir Charles Lyell, upon the other hand, was, I believe,
\par persuaded of its existence from the numerous accounts which
\par he accumulated on the occasion of his second visit to
\par America, especially evidence procured for him by Mr. J. W.
\par Dawson, of Pictou, as to one seen, in 1844, at Arisaig,
\par near the north-east end of Nova Scotia, and as to
\par THE SEA-8EEPENT. 329
\par another, in August 1845, at Merigomish, in the Gulf of
\par St. Lawrence.
\par Agassiz also gave in his adhesion to it. " I have asked
\par myself, in connection with this subject, whether there is not
\par such an animal as the sea-serpent. There are many who
\par will doubt the existence of such a creature until it can be
\par brought under the dissecting knife ; but it has been seen by
\par so many on whom we may rely, that it is wrong to doubt
\par any longer. The truth is, however, that if a naturalist had
\par to sketch the outlines of an icthyosaurus or plesiosaurus
\par from the remains we have of them, he would make a drawing
\par very similar to the sea-serpent as it has been described.
\par There is reason to think that the parts are soft and perishable,
\par but I still consider it probable that it will be the good
\par fortune of some person on the coast of Norway or North
\par America to find a living representative of this type of reptile,
\par which is thought to have died out."
\par Mr. Z. Newman was the first scientific man to absolutely
\par affirm his belief in its existence, and to indicate its probable
\par zoological affinities ; and he was ably followed by Mr. Gosse,
\par who, in the charming work* already frequently quoted, exhaustively
\par discusses the whole question.
\par Mr. Gosse, however, to my mind, forgoes a great
\par portion of the advantage of his argument by a too
\par limited acceptance of authorities, and leaves untouched, as
\par have all who preceded him, the question of the breathing
\par apparatus of the creature, and also omits insisting, as he
\par might well have done, on the remarkable coincidence of
\par the seasons and climatic conditions at and under which
\par the creature ordinarily exhibits itself, which may be
\par quoted first as an argument in favour of the reality of
\par the different stories, and, secondly, as affording indica-

\par London, 1880, 12th edition ; Second Series, 1875, 5th edition.
\par 330 MYTHICAL MONSTEUS.
\par tions of the nature and habits of the creature to which they
\par relate.
\par Both Mr. Newman and Mr. Gosse, moreover, laboured
\par under the disadvantage of being unacquainted with some of
\par the later stories, such as that of the Nestor sea-serpent seen
\par in the Straits of Malacca, which appears to amply substantiate
\par the general conclusion at which they had already,
\par happily, as I conceive, arrived.
\par In nearly all the cases quoted, and in all of those where
\par the creature has appeared in the deep fjords of Norway or
\par in the bays of other coasts, the date of its appearance has
\par been some time during the months of July and August, and
\par the weather calm and hot. These last summer conditions, in
\par high latitudes, do not obtain for long together, so that the
\par auspices favourable to the appearance of the creature would
\par probably not exist for more than a few weeks in each
\par season, and during the remainder of the year it would rest
\par secluded in the depths of the fjords, presuming those to be
\par its permanent habitation, or in some oceanic home, if, as
\par would seem more likely to be the case, its appearance in
\par the bays and fjords was simply due to a temporary visit,
\par made possibly in connection with its reproduction; for,
\par were its habitation in the fjords constant, we should expect
\par it to make its appearance annually, instead of at irregular
\par and distant intervals.
\par We must also infer that it is a non-air-breathing creature.
\par Professor Owen, in his very able discussion of the Dcedalus
\par story, bases his main argument against the serpentine
\par character of the creature seen in this and other instances on
\par there being either no undulation at all of the body, or a vertical
\par one, which is not a characteristic of serpents, and on
\par the fact of no remains having ever been discovered washed
\par up on the Norway coasts. He says :
\par " Now, a serpent, being an air-breathing animal, with long
\par vesicular and receptacular lungs, dives with an effort, and
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 381
\par commonly floats when dead, and so would the sea-serpent,
\par until decomposition or accident had opened the tough integument
\par and let out the imprisoned gases During life
\par the exigencies of the respiration of the great sea-serpent
\par would always compel him frequently to the surface ; and,
\par when dead and swollen, it would
\par Prone on the flood, extended long and large,
\par Lie floating many a rood.
\par Such a spectacle, demonstrative of the species if it existed,
\par has not hitherto met the gaze of any of the countless voyagers
\par who have traversed the seas in so many directions."
\par But, assuming it to be neither a serpent nor an airbreathing
\par creature, the very cogent arguments which he
\par applied so powerfully fall to the ground, and I may at once
\par state that a review of the whole of the reported cases of its
\par appearance entirely favours the first assumption, while a little
\par reflection will show the necessity of the latter. No airbreathing
\par creature, or rather a creature furnished with lungs,
\par could possibly exist, even for a season only, in the inland bays
\par of populous countries like Norway and Scotland without continually
\par exposing itself to observation ; but this is not the
\par case. Whereas there is no difficulty in conceiving that a
\par creature adapted to live in the depths of the ocean could
\par breathe readily enough at the surface, even for considerable
\par periods ; for we know that fish of many kinds, and notably
\par carp, can retain life for days, and even weeks, when removed
\par from the water, provided they happen to be in a moist
\par situation.
\par Again, a power of constriction, a characteristic of boas and
\par pythons, and therefore implying an alliance with them, is not
\par necessarily indicated, as might be supposed, even by the
\par action affirmed in Captain Drevar's story ; for a creature of
\par serpentine form, attacking another, might coil itself round
\par for the mere purpose of maintaining a hold while it tore its
\par 332 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par victim open with its powerful jaws and teeth. This action is
\par simply that of an eel which, on being hooked, grasps weeds
\par at the bottom to resist capture.
\par Nor are we bound to accept in any way the captain's
\par suggestion that the monster gorged its victim after the fashion
\par of a land-serpent. It may as readily have torn it open and
\par fed on it as an eel might ; and it is, indeed, not unreasonable
\par to suppose that so powerful a monster would find its prey
\par among large creatures, such as seals, porpoises, and the
\par smaller cetacese.
\par That the sea-serpent was formerly more frequently seen
\par on the Norwegian coasts than now I consider probable, as
\par also that its visits were connected with its breeding season,
\par and discontinued in consequence of the greater number and
\par larger size of vessels, and especially of the introduction of
\par steam. As a parallel instance, I may mention that, in the
\par early days of the settlement of Australia, sperm whales
\par resorted to the harbours along its coasts for calving purposes,
\par and were sufficiently numerous to cause the maintenance
\par of what were called "
\par bay whaling stations
\par "
\par at Hobart
\par Town, Spring Bay, and many other harbours of Tasmania
\par and South Australia. At the present time, the sperm whale
\par rarely approaches within ten miles of the coast, and the small
\par whaling fleet finds scanty occupation in the ocean extending
\par south from the great Australian bight to the south cape
\par of Tasmania. Mr. Gosse eliminates from his concluding
\par analysis of sea-serpent stories all those recorded by Norwegian
\par and American observers, and argues only upon a selected
\par number resting on British evidence.
\par By this contraction he loses as a basis of argument a
\par number of accounts which I consider as credible as those he
\par quotes, and from which positive deductions might be drawn,
\par more weighty than those of similar, but merely inferential,
\par character which he employs.
\par The account of the monster seen by Hans Egede, for
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 333
\par example, where the creature exhibited itself more completely
\par than it did in any of the instances selected by Mr. Gosse,
\par specifically indicated the possession of paws, flippers, fins or
\par paddles, while this can only be surmised at, in the latter
\par cases to which I refer, from the progressive steady motion of
\par the creature, with the head and neck elevated above the
\par surface, and apparently unaffected by any undulatory motion
\par of the body. This at once removes it from the serpent class,
\par without any necessity for the additional confirmation which
\par the enlarged proportions of the body in comparison with
\par those of the neck, as given in Egede's amended version,
\par afford us.
\par The creature seen in the Straits of Malacca, and one
\par quoted by Mr. Newman, in the Zoologist, exhibit characters
\par which confirm Egede's story. In the latter instance,
\par "
\par Captain the Hon. George Hope states that, when in
\par H.M.S. Fty, in the Gulf of California, the sea being perfectly
\par calm and transparent, he saw at the moment a large marine
\par animal, with the head and general figure of an alligator,
\par except that the neck was much longer, and that instead of
\par legs the creature had four large flappers, somewhat like those
\par of turtles, the anterior pair being larger than those of the
\par posterior. The creature was distinctly visible, and all its
\par movements could be observed with ease. It appeared to be
\par pursuing its prey at the bottom of the sea. Its movements
\par were somewhat serpentine, and an appearance of annulations
\par or ring-like divisions of the body were distinctly perceptible."
\par Mr. Gosse, commenting on this story, says :
\par " Now, unless
\par this officer was egregiously deceived, he saw an animal which
\par could have been no other than an Enaliosaur, a marine reptile
\par of large size, of sauroid figure, with turtle-like paddles."
\par In the former case the creature was far more gigantic and
\par robust, in contradistinction to the slender and serpentine
\par form more usually observed, and we must consequently infer
\par that there is not merely one but several distinct species of
\par 334 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par marine monster, unknown and rarely exhibiting themselves,
\par belonging to different genera, and perhaps orders, but all
\par popularly included under the title of "
\par sea-serpent."
\par The attempt to classify these presents difficulties. Mr.
\par Gosse, however, has very ably reviewed the somewhat scanty
\par materials at his command, and, agreeing with the suggestion
\par made originally by Mr. Newman, has elaborated the argument
\par that one of the old Enaliosaurs exists to the present
\par day. This form, Palaeontology tells us, commenced in the
\par Carboniferous, attained its maximum specific development in
\par the Jurassic, and continued to the close of the Cretaceous
\par periods. This rational suggestion is supported by the collateral
\par argument that some few Ganoid fishes and species of
\par Terebratula, have continuously existed to tthe present time ;
\par that certain Placoid fishes, of which we have no trace, and
\par which consequently must have been very scarce during Tertiary
\par periods, reappear abundantly as recent species ; that the
\par Iguanodon is represented by the Iguana of the American
\par tropics, and that the Trionychidae, or river tortoises, which
\par commenced during the Wealden, and disappeared from
\par thence until the present period, are now abundantly represented
\par in the rivers of the Old and the New World.
\par The points of resemblance between the northern and most
\par often seen form of the sea-serpent and certain genera of the
\par Enaliosaurs, such as Plesiosaurus, are a long swan -like
\par neck, a flattened lizard-like head and progress by means of
\par paddles. A difficulty in this connection arises, however, in
\par respect to the breathing apparatus. Palaeontologists favour
\par the idea that the Plesiosaurus and its allies were air-breathing
\par creatures with long necks, adapted to habitual projection
\par above the surface. Such a construction and habit is, as I
\par have before said, to my mind, impossible in the case of an
\par animal of so scarce an appearance as the sea-serpent ; and I
\par am incapable of estimating how far the theory is inflexible
\par in regard to the old forms that I have mentioned. May
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 335
\par there not be some large marine form combining some of the
\par characters of the salamander and the saurians ; may not the
\par pigmy newt of Europe, the large salamander tenanting the
\par depths of Lake Biwa in Japan, and the famous fossil form,
\par the Homo Diluvii Testis of Sheuzberg, have a marine cousin
\par linking them with the gigantic forms which battled in the
\par Oolitic seas ? May not the tuft of loose skin or scroll encircling
\par its head have some connection with a branchial
\par apparatus analagous to that of the Amphibia ; and was not
\par the large fringe round the neck, like a beard, noticed on
\par the one seen by Captain Anderson when in the Delta in
\par 1861, of a similar nature ?
\par In conclusion, I must strongly express my own conviction,
\par which I hope, after the perusal of the evidence contained
\par in the foregoing pages, will be shared by my readers, that,
\par let the relations of the sea-serpent be what they may ; let
\par it be serpent, saurian, or fish, or some form intermediate
\par to them ; and even granting that those relations may never
\par be determined, or only at some very distant date ; yet, nevertheless,
\par the creature must now be removed from the regions
\par of myth, and credited with having a real existence, and that
\par its name includes not one. only, but probably several very
\par distinct gigantic species, allied 'more or less closely, and
\par constructed to dwell in the depths of the ocean, and which
\par only occasionally exhibit themselves to a fortune-favoured
\par wonder-gazing crew.
\par NOTE.
\par It is with great pleasure that I add the following testimony of a belief
\par in the existence of the sea-serpent, from a country which has not
\par hitherto been supposed to have any traditions relating to it. My
\par inquiries in Burmah, as to a belief among its inhabitants in sundry

\par " The creature Nyan is called in the Magadha language Tanti-gdha,
\par in the Bengali Gara ; in the Sakkata, Grdha or Avagrdh ; and in the
\par Burmese, Nyan.
\par 11 Hence are to be found the following passages, viz. :
\par " '

\par or two hundred fathoms,' in "the Shri Sariputtara Apadan.

\par and
\par " ' Dvagar samudda maha nady sanga mela tdkd yazantu vigera
\par itichate,' in the commentary of the Amarakosha Abhidhan.
\par " From these works, which contain definitions of two words designative
\par of the creature Nyan, it will be gathered that there does exist a
\par predatory monster in the form of an earthworm, which inhabits estuaries
\par and the mouths of great rivers.
\par "
\par Regarding the predatory instincts of this creature, it should be
\par understood that it attacks even such animals as elephants. Hence the
\par Dhammathats, in dealing with the decision of cases of hire of live-stock,
\par wishing to point out that no fault lies through losses owing to natural
\par accidents, make the following remarks :
\par " * There shall be no fault held if oxen die by reason of a snake gliding
\par under them.'
\par *' ' There shall be no fault held, if buffaloes die by reason of a dove
\par resting on their horns.'
\par " * There shall be no fault held if oxen and buffaloes die of their having
\par eaten a grasshopper.'
\par " ' There shall be no fault held if elephants die by reason of their
\par having been encoiled in the folds of a Nyan.'
\par " * There shall be no fault held if horses die by reason of their having
\par been sucked by bilas.'
\par " The Poetical Version of the Pokinnaka Dhammathat, which is a compilation
\par of several Dhammathats, in the same strain, says :

\par " From such passages it will be seen that there is a frightful monster
\par of extraordinary strength, which is capable of capturing even such
\par animals as elephants,"
\par THE SEA-SERPENT. 337
\par " In the form of oath of fealty administered by successive kings to
\par their feudatories and vassals, the following imprecation is to be
\par found :
\par " ' May I die through being seized by alligators and Nyans.'
\par "
\par [Here follows an explanatory note respecting the four species of
\par danger to be found in the ocean.]
\par " In the reign of King Alaung-mindara-gye, the founder of the city
\par of Eatana Singha when he went on an expedition against Ayudhara or
\par Yodhaya (Siam) and was crossing the Martaban river, he lost some two
\par or three elephants, which were destroyed as soon as they had entered
\par the water. The King ascertained from the lower country inhabitants
\par that they had been captured and bitten by the creature Nyan. Two or
\par three elephants were similarly lost in Ava, when it was also ascertained
\par that they had been captured by the Nyan. There goes a saying that
\par the Nyan is some one to two hundred fathoms long. The form of oath
\par of fealty contains an imprecation in which the Nyan is to fulfil a part.
\par And there are writings which make mention of its existence."

\par may possibly refer to some animal of a type intermediate to
\par them, now almost, if not quite, extinct. In some instances it
\par is supposed that a species of rhinoceros is indicated.
\par There has been much discussion as to the identity of the
\par animal referred to in many passages of the Bible, the Hebrew
\par name of which, Reem, has been translated " unicorn." Mr.
\par W. Smith considers that a species of rhinoceros could not
\par have been indicated, as it is spoken of in one passage as a
\par sacrificial animal, whereas the ceremonial ritual of the Jews
\par forbade the use of any animal not possessing the double
\par qualifications of chewing the cud and being cloven-footed.
\par The qualities attributed to it are great strength, an indomitable
\par disposition, fierce nature, and an active and playful disposition
\par when young. He considers that the passage, Deut.
\par xxxiii. 17, should be rendered " his horns are like the horns
\par of a unicorn," and not, as it is given,
\par " horns of unicorns
\par "
\par ;
\par and is of opinion that some species of wild ox is intended.
\par Among profane Western authors we first find the unicorn
\par referred to by Ctesias, who describes it as having one horn,
\par a cubit long. Herodotus also mentions it in the passage,*
\par " For the eastern side of Libya, where the wanderers dwell,
\par is low and sandy, as far as the river Triton ; but westward
\par of that, the land of the husbandmen is very hilly and abounds
\par with forests and wild beasts, for this is the tract in which
\par the huge serpents are found, and the lions, the elephants,
\par the bears, the aspicks, and the horned asses
\par "
\par ; and again,
\par " Among the wanderers are none of these, but quite other
\par animals, as antelopes, &c. &c,, and asses, not of the horned
\par sort, but of a kind which does not need to drink/'
\par Aristotle f mentions two unicorn animals. " There are
\par only a few [animals] that have a solid hoof and one horn,
\par as the Indian ass and the oryx."
\par * Book iv. ch. cxci. and cxcii.
\par f Book ii. ch. ii. 8.

\par 340 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Pliny* tells us that the Orsaean Indians hunt down a very
\par fierce animal called the monoceros, which has the head of
\par the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar,
\par while the rest of the body is like that of the horse. It makes
\par a deep lowing noise, and has a single black horn, projecting
\par from the middle of its forehead, and two cubits in length.
\par This animal, it is said, cannot be taken alive. In speaking
\par of the Indian ass, he says,t
\par " the Indian ass is only a onehorned
\par animal
\par "
\par ; and of the oryx of Africa, J "the oryx is
\par both one-horned and cloven -footed.
\par "
\par ,ZElian transfers the locality back again from Africa to
\par Asia, and it may be presumed, in the following quotation,
\par that he indicates the country north of the Himalaya, Thibet,
\par and Tartary, which still has the reputation of being one of
\par the homes of the unicorn.
\par "
\par They say that there are mountains in the innermost
\par regions of India inaccessible to men, and full of wild beasts ;
\par where those creatures which with us are domesticated,
\par such as sheep, dogs, goats, and cattle, range about at their
\par own free will, free from any charge by a shepherd or herdsman.
\par " Both historians, and the more learned of the Indians,
\par among whom the Brahmins may be specified, declare that
\par there is a countless number of these beasts. Among them
\par they enumerate the unicorn, which they call cartazonon, and
\par say that it reaches the size of a horse of mature age, possesses
\par a mane and reddish yellow hair, and that it excels in
\par swiftness through the excellence of its feet and of its whole
\par body. Like the elephant, it has inarticulate feet, and it has
\par a boar's tail ; one black horn projects between the eyebrows,
\par * Book viii. ch. xxxii.

\par not awkwardly, but with a certain natural twist, and terminating
\par in a sharp point.
\par " It has, of all animals, the harshest and most contentious
\par voice. It is said to be gentle to other beasts approaching it,
\par but to fight with its fellows. Not only are the males at
\par variance in natural contention amongst themselves, but they
\par also fight with the females, and carry their combats to the
\par length of killing the conquered ; for not only are their
\par bodies generally indued with great strength, but also they
\par are armed with an invincible horn. It frequents desert
\par regions and wanders alone and solitary. In the breeding
\par season it is of gentle demeanour towards the female, and
\par they feed together; when this has passed and the female
\par has become gravid, it again becomes fierce and wanders
\par alone.
\par "
\par They say that the young, while still of tender age, are
\par carried to the King of the Prasians for exhibition of their
\par strength, and exposed in combats on festivals ; for no one
\par remembers them to have been captured of mature age."
\par Csesar* records the reputed existence in his day, within
\par the bounds of the great Hercynian Forest, of a bull, shaped
\par like a stag, with one horn projecting from the middle of its
\par forehead and between the ears.
\par CosmaSjt surnamed Indicopleustes, a merchant of Alexandria,
\par who lived in the sixth century, and made a voyage to
\par India, and subsequently wrote works on cosmography, gives
\par a figure of the unicorn, not, as he says, from actual sight of
\par it, but reproduced from four figures of it in brass contained
\par in the palace of the King of Ethiopia. He states, from
\par report, that "it is impossible to take this ferocious beast
\par alive ; and that all its strength lies in its horn. When it
\par finds itself pursued and in danger of capture, it throws

\par itself from a precipice, and turns so aptly in falling, that it
\par receives all the shock upon the horn, and so escapes safe
\par and sound." It is noteworthy that this mode of escape is
\par attributed, at the present day, to both the musk ox and the
\par Ovis Ammon.
\par Marco Polo may or may not indicate a rhinoceros in the
\par passage,
\par "

\par d'elephants et de licornes et d'autres betes sauvages. II n'y
\par a ni hommes ni habitations aussi, nous laisserons ce lieu."
\par But no such inference can be attached to the descriptions
\par of the Ethiopian unicorn by Leo and Ludolphus.
\par The first says :*
\par " The unicorn is found in the mountains of high Ethiopia.
\par It is of an ash colour and resembles a colt of two years old,
\par excepting that it has the head of a goat, and in the middle of
\par its ;forehead a horn three feet long, which is smooth and
\par white like ivory, and has yellow streaks running along from
\par top to bottom.
\par " This horn is an antidote against poison, and it is
\par reported that other animals delay drinking till it has soaked
\par .its horn in the water to purify it. This animal is so nimble
\par that it can neither be killed nor taken. But it casts its horn
\par like a stag, and the hunters find it in the deserts. But the
\par truth of this is called in question by some authors/*
\par Ludolphusf says :
\par " Here is also another beast, called arucharis, with one
\par horn, fierce and strong, of which unicorn several have been
\par seen feeding in the woods."

\par Coming down to later days we find the unicorn described
\par by Lewes Vertomannus* he who, having visited, among
\par other places, the site of the legend of St. George and the
\par Dragon, f and undergone a variety of adventures, visits, in
\par the course of them, the temple of Mecca, and, as follows,
\par gives a description
\par " of the unicorns"of the Temple of Mecha,
\par which are not seen in any other place."
\par " On the other part of the temple are parks or places
\par enclosed, where are seen two unicorns, named of the Greeks
\par monocerotse, and are there showed to the people for a miracle,
\par and not without good reason, for the seldomness and strange
\par nature. The one of them, which is much higher than the
\par other, yet not much unlike to a colt of thirty months of
\par age ; in the forehead groweth only one horn, in manner
\par right foorth, of the length of three cubits. The other is
\par much younger, of the age of one year, and like a young
\par colt ; the horn of this is of the length of four handfulls.
\par " This beast is of the colour of a horse of weesell colour,
\par and hath the head like a hart, but no long neck, a thynne
\par mane hanging only on the one side. Their leggs are thin
\par and slender like a fawn or hind. The hoofs of the fore-feet
\par are divided in two, much like the feet of a goat. The outer
\par part of the hinder feet is very full of hair.
\par " This beast doubtless seemeth wild and fierce, yet tempereth
\par that fierceness with a certain comeliness.
\par " These unicorns one gave to the Sultan of Mecha as a most
\par precious and rare gift. They were sent him out of Ethiope
\par by a king of that country who desired by that present to
\par gratify the Sultan of Mecha."

\par starting for Persia, Vertomannus was driven back by a
\par contrary wind to Zeila (in Africa), which he describes as
\par being an important city with much merchandise when again
\par he says,
\par " I saw there also certain kyne, having only one
\par horn in the middle of the forehead, as hath the unicorn, and
\par about a span in length, but the horn bendeth backwards.
\par They are of bright shining red colour."
\par In an account of the travels of Johann Grueber, Jesuit
\par (about 1661), contained in Astley's collection of voyages, we
\par find:
\par "
\par Sining* is a great and populous city, built at the vast
\par wall of China, through the gate of which the merchants from
\par India enter Katay or China. There are stairs to go a-top of
\par the wall, and many travel on it from the gate at Sining to
\par the next at Soochew, which is eighteen days' journey, having
\par a delightful prospect all the way, from the wall, of the innumerable
\par habitations on one side, and the various wild beasts
\par which range the desert on the other side.
\par " Besides wild bulls, here are tigers, lions, elephants,
\par rhinoceroses, and monoceroses, which are a kind of horned
\par asses.
\par " Thus the merchants view the beasts free from danger,
\par especially from that part of the wall which, running southward,
\par approaches Quang-si, Yunnan, and Tibet; for at certain times
\par of the year they betake themselves to the Yellow Eiver, an<7
\par parts near the wall which abound with thickets, in order to
\par get pasture and seek their prey."
\par Father Jerome Lobo, a Portuguese Jesuit, who embarked
\par for Abyssinia in the year 1622,t states that
\par " In the province of Agaus has been seen the unicorn ;
\par that beast so much talked of and so little known. The

\par wood into another has given me no opportunity of examining
\par it particularly ; yet I have had so near a sight of it as
\par to be able to give some description of it.
\par " The shape is the same with that of a beautiful horse,
\par exact and nicely proportioned, of a bay colour, with a black
\par tail, which in some provinces is long, in others very short ;
\par some have long manes hanging to the ground. They are so
\par timorous that they never feed but surrounded with other
\par beasts that defend them.
\par " Deer and other defenceless animals often herd about the
\par elephant, which, contenting himself with roots and leaves,
\par preserves the beasts that place themselves, as it were, under
\par his protection, from the others that would devour them."
\par There is a somewhat doubtful story contained in the
\par Narrative of a Journey from St. Petersburg, in Russia, to Peking,
\par in China, in 1719,* to the effect that between Tobolsky and
\par Tomski
\par " Our baggage having waited at Tara till our arrival, we
\par left that place on the 18th, and next came to a large Russian
\par village sixty versts from Tara, and the last inhabited by
\par Russians till you pass the Baraba and come to the river Oby.
\par .... One of these hunters told me the following story,
\par which was confirmed by several of his neighbours, that in the
\par year 1713, in the month of March, being out a-hunting, he
\par discovered the track of a stag, which he pursued. At overtaking
\par the animal he was somewhat startled on observing it
\par had only one horn, stuck in the middle of its forehead.
\par Being near this village, he drove it home, and showed it, to
\par the great admiration of the spectators. He afterwards killed
\par it, and ate the flesh, and sold the horn to a comb-maker in
\par the town of Tara, for ten alteens, about fifteen pence
\par sterling.
\par " I inquired carefully about the shape and size of this

\par unicorn, as I shall call it, and was told that it exactly
\par resembled a stag.
\par " The horn was of a hrownish colour, about one archaeon
\par or twenty-eight inches long, and twisted from the root till
\par within a finger's length of the tip, where it was divided, like
\par a fork, into two points, very sharp."
\par One of the most trustworthy of observers, the Abbe Hue,
\par speaks very positively on the subject of the unicorn.* He
\par says :
\par " The unicorn really exists in Thibet. . . . We had
\par for a long time a small Mongol Treatise on Natural History,
\par for the use of children, in which a unicorn formed one of the
\par pictorial illustrations. . . . The Chinese Itinerary says, on
\par the subject of the lake you see before your arrival at Atzder
\par (going from east to west),
\par ' The unicorn, a very curious
\par animal, is found in the vicinity of this lake, which is forty li
\par long/
\par "
\par The unicorn is known in Thibet by the name of serou ; in
\par Mongolia, by that of here ; while in a Thibetan manuscript
\par examined by the late Major Lattre, it is called the one-horned
\par tsopo.
\par Mr. Hazlitt, in his notes appended to the statement by
\par Hue as to the unicorn, states that Mr. Hodgson, of Nepaul,
\par sent to Calcutta the skin and horn of a unicorn that died in
\par the menagerie of the Kajah of Nepaul.
\par It was described as being very fierce, and abundant in the
\par plains of Tingri, in the southern part of the Thibetan province
\par of Tsang, watered by the Arroun ; it assembled round salt
\par beds. The form is graceful, colour reddish, two tufts of hair
\par project from the exterior of each nostril, and there is much
\par down round the hair and mouth. The hair is rough and
\par seems hollow. Doctor Able designated it Antelope Hodgsonii.

\par Antoine d'Abbadie, a unicorn animal which he had received
\par when at Melpes in Kordofan :
\par " I met, on the 17th of April 1848, a man who was in the
\par habit of selling to me specimens of animals. One day he
\par asked me if I wished also for an a'nasa, which he described
\par thus :
\par ' It is the size of a small donkey, has a thick body and
\par thin bones, coarse hair, and tail like a boar. It has a long
\par horn on its forehead, and lets it hang when alone, but erects
\par it immediately on seeing an enemy. It is a formidable
\par weapon, but I do not know its exact length. The anasa is
\par found not far from here (Melpes), towards the south-southwest.
\par I have seen it often in the wild grounds, where the
\par negroes kill it, and carry it home to make shields from its
\par skin.' N.B. This man was well acquainted with the rhinoceros,
\par which he distinguished, under the name of fetit, from
\par the anasa.
\par te On June the 14th I was at Kursi, also in Kordofan, and
\par met there a slave merchant who was not acquainted with
\par my first informer, and gave me spontaneously the same
\par description of the a'nasa, adding that he had killed and eaten
\par one long ago, and that its flesh was well flavoured."
\par This creature is mentioned by Kupell, under the name of
\par Niltekma or Arase, as indigenous to Kordofan, and, by
\par Cavassi, as known in Congo under that of Abada.
\par Mr. Freeman, in the South African Christian Recorder
\par (vol. i.), gives the native account of an animal not uncommon
\par in Makooa, and called the Ndzoodzoo, described as being
\par about the size of a horse, extremely fleet and strong, with a
\par single horn from two feet to two and a half feet in length,
\par projecting from its forehead, which is said to be flexible
\par when the animal is asleep, and capable of being curled up at
\par pleasure, but becoming stiff and hard under the excitement of
\par rage. It is extremely fierce, and invariably attacks a man
\par when it discerns him. The female is without a horn.
\par Our latest information as to this species comes from Pre348
\par MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par jevalski,* who, speaking of it as the orongo, says that it has
\par elegant black horns standing vertically above the head ; the
\par back is dun-coloured ; the middle of the breast, stomach, and
\par rump, white ; seen at a distance it appears white ; it is very
\par numerous in Northern Thibet. He adds :
\par " Another prevalent
\par superstition is that the orongo has only one horn growing
\par vertically from the centre of the head. In Kansu and Kokonor
\par we were told that unicorns were rare, one or two in a thousand.
\par The Mongols in Tsaidan deny it, but say it may be
\par so in south-west Thibet."
\par Turning to the Chinese classics and books of antiquity, we
\par find references, sometimes vague and mythical, sometimes
\par exact, to several distinct unicorn animals. These may be
\par enumerated as :
\par f 1. The Ki-Lin, represented in Japan by the Kirin.
\par 2. The King.
\par 3. The Kioh Twan.
\par 4. The Poh.
\par 5. The Hiai Chai.
\par 6. The Too Jon Sheu.
\par Besides these there are clear descriptions of the rhinoceros,
\par which cannot in any way be confounded with the above. The
\par only one of these popularly familiar is the Ki-Lin, the history
\par of which is interwoven with that of remote ages. The first
\par mention of it is made in the Bamboo Books only in that
\par part, however, of them which is apparently a commentary,
\par note, or subsequent addition, though some authorities hold
\par it to be a portion of the actual text. The work states that,
\par during the reign of Hwang-Ti (B.C. 2697), Ki-Lins appeared
\par in the parks.
\par Their appearance was generally supposed to signalise the
\par reign of an upright monarch, and Confucius considered that

\par the appearance of one during his epoch was a bad omen, as
\par it did not harmonise with the troubled state of the times.
\par The name Ki-Lin is a generic or dual word, composed of
\par those of the Ki and the Lin, the respective male and female
\par of the creature.
\par FIG. 70. THE Ki-Lra. (After a modern Chinese painting.)
\par This peculiar species of word formation is adopted in
\par other instances in reference to birds and animals ; thus we
\par have the male Fung and the female Hwang united in the
\par Fung Hwang, or so-called Chinese phoenix, and the Yuen
\par and Yang in the Yuen Yang, or mandarin duck.
\par Sometimes the word Lin alone is used with the same
\par generic meaning.
\par The 'Rh Ya, in the original text, defines the Lin as having
\par a Kiun's body (the Kiun is a kind of muntjack or deer), an
\par ox's tail, and one horn. The commentary states that the
\par 350 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par tip of the horn is fleshy, and that the King Yang chapter of
\par the "
\par Spring and Autumn Annals
\par "
\par of Confucius defines it as
\par a horned Kiun.
\par FIG. 80. THE LIN (FEMALE OF THE" CHINESE UNICORN). (From the'Rh Ya.)
\par The preface to the Shi Shu quotes Li Shin to the effect
\par that the Lin is an auspicious and perfect beast.
\par Sun Yen says it is a spiritual beast. The Shwoh Wan says
\par THE UNICORN. 351
\par the Lin is the female of the K'i and the K'i is a beast
\par endowed with goodness, possessing a Kiun's body, an ox's
\par tail, and one horn. According to the Shwoh Wan, the Lin
\par may be considered as a large female deer. Now the Shu King
\par considers that many of these beasts are comprised under the
\par Ki-Lin, only the characters, though retaining the sound, have
\par become altered in form.
\par Cheu Nau calls it Lin-che-chi and Man Chw'en says that
\par the Lin is truthful, and reducible to rule.
\par The Li Yuen says : "If the unicorn can once be tamed,
\par then the other beasts will not show terror."
\par Ta Tai, in the Li Ki, quoting the Yih [King], says there
\par are 360 kinds of hairy creatures, and the Ki-Lin is the chief
\par of them.
\par The Li Ki, commenting on the King Fang I Chw'en,
\par says :
\par " The Lin has a Kiun's body, an ox's tail, a horse's
\par hoof, and is of five colours. It is twelve feet high."
\par *
\par Again, in commenting on Fuh Kien's Ho Chwen, it says :
\par " The Lin springs from the earth's central regions. It is a
\par beast of superior integrity, is attached to its mother, and
\par reducible to rule. The Shu King, quoting Luh Li, says the
\par Lin has a Kiun's body, an ox's tail, a horse's feet, and a
\par yellow colour, round hoofs, and one horn ; the tip of the
\par horn is erect and fleshy.
\par " Its call in the middle part thereof is like a monastery bell.
\par Its pace is regular ; it rambles only on selected grounds and
\par after it has examined the locality. It will not live in herds,
\par or be accompanied in its movements. It cannot be beguiled
\par into pitfalls, or captured in snares. When the monarch is
\par virtuous, this beast appears."

\par Cheu. Even the large or small Lin are always like deer, so
\par that this species is not the auspicious Ying Lin ; although
\par Tsz Ma Siang Su,* in his odes on the shooting of the Mi
\par and trapping Lin, says that it is.
\par The top of the horn being fleshy is a characteristic of the
\par Lin, and Mao Chw'en says that the Lin's horn is an emblem
\par of goodness. Ching Tsien says that the horn has a fleshy
\par termination, indicating the peaceful character of the beast,
\par and that it has no use for it.
\par The s( Book of Rites,'' quoting the Kwang Ya, says that
\par on account of its elegant style it takes place, par excellence,
\par among the large-horned beasts ; the existing edition of the
\par Kwang Ya omits this.
\par The Kung Yang Chw'en says the Kiun also has horns.
\par Kung Ssun Tsz, in the annals of the fourteenth year of
\par the Duke Ngai (State of Lu), says that the Kiun has fleshy
\par horns.
\par Kwoh, in his preface, proves the Lin to have a Kiun's
\par body.
\par The 'Rh Ya gives the drawing of a unicorn animal called the
\par Ki ; but no reference to the horn is given in the text, which
\par simply describes it as a large Kiun with a yak's tail and
\par dog's feet.
\par The Ki is not defined in the 'Rh Ya, and the only information
\par I have as to it is derived from Williams' dictionary,
\par where it is stated to be " a fabulous auspicious animal, which
\par appears when sages are born ; the male of the Chinese
\par unicorn. It is drawn like a piebald scaly horse, with one
\par horn and a cow's tail, and may have had a living original in
\par some extinct equine animal." But there is a very full

\par that it is identical with the King which, in the usual brief

\par style of the original text of the 'Rh Ya, is epitomised as a
\par large Biao (a kind of stag), with an ox's tail and one horn;
\par and the several commentaries on it are as follows :
\par FIG. 81. THE Ki.
\par " In the time of the Emperor Wu, of the Han dynasty,
\par during the worship of heaven and earth at the solstices at
\par Yung, there was captured a unicorn beast like a Piao ; it
\par 23
\par 354 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par was at that time designated the Lin ; it was, however, a Piao
\par related to the Chang (a kind of deer)."
\par The Shwoh Wan says :
\par " The King is a large stag with an
\par FIG. 82. THE KI.VG. (From the Rk Ya.\}
\par ox's tail and one horn." It may be a large form of the
\par Piao. The Wang Hwu Analects say that the Piao is an
\par object of the chase, and that it is as swift as a stag.
\par THE UNICORN. 355
\par Kwan Tsz, in the Ti Yuen volume, says that as there are
\par Mi and Piao and many species of deer, so also the Piao is a
\par species of deer.
\par The " Shi Ki," in the book Fung Shen, says that during
\par the worship at the solstices at Yung, there was captured a
\par one-horned beast like a Piao, and that the local authorities

\par Wu Chao's preface to the Loh Yiu says :
\par " The body is
\par like that of a muntjack, and it has one horn"; while the
\par Spring and Autumn (Annals) allude to this animal in speaking
\par of the horned Kiun.
\par The inhabitants of Ch'u say the Kiun is a Piao. Kwoh,
\par in his preface, says that the capture made in the time of Wu,
\par of the Han dynasty, was actually a Piao, as demonstrated by
\par the Han books. The Chung Kiun narrative states that in
\par Shang Yung was captured a white Lin bearing one horn,
\par of which the tip was fleshy. At the present day nothing has
\par been heard of a Piao with a
\par fleshyjtip,
\par therefore these must be
\par different beasts.
\par Kwoh also says that the Piao is identical with the Chang,
\par and the Chang with the Kiun. This corresponds with what
\par Wei Chao So had already stated, that the people of Ch'u
\par assert that the Kiun is a Piao, and that the Piao is certainly
\par a kind of deer.
\par Its meat is eminently savoury.
\par Luh Ki says that of all four-footed creatures, the Piao is
\par the most excellent.
\par Yeu Shi states in the Kiao Sz annals (" Sacrifices to

\par body exactly resembles that of the Chang.
\par Finally, the explanatory prefaces of many classical works,
\par when commenting on the 'Rh la, say that the Piao is

\par identical with the Chang and of a black colour ; and they

\par It was probably some unicorn animal which is referred to
\par in the General History of China, called the Tong Kien Rang
\par Mu (vide Pere de Mailla's translation), as having been presented
\par to the Emperor Yung Loh of the Ming dynasty, in
\par A.D. 1415, by envoys from Bengal. De Mailla says it was

\par Again, the same History says that in the succeeding year

\par The same encyclopaedia figures another unicorn beast
\par under the name of the Kai Tsi, and describes it as being an
\par animal of foreign countries, resembling a lion, and having a
\par single horn. It is also called the Sin You or divine sheep.

\par CHAPTEK XI.
\par THE CHINESE PH(ENIX.
\par FBOM the date of the earliest examination of the literature
\par of China, it has been customary among Sinologues to trace a
\par fancied resemblance between a somewhat remarkable bird,
\par which occupies an important position in the early traditions
\par of that Empire, and the phoenix of Western authors. Some
\par mythologists have even subsequently concluded that the
\par Fung Hwang of the Chinese, the phoenix of the Greeks,
\par the Roc of the Arabs, and the Garuda of the Hindoos, are
\par merely national modifications of the same myth. I do not
\par hold this opinion, and, in opposing it, purpose, in the future,
\par to discuss each of these birds in detail, although in the
\par present volume I treat only of the Fung Hwang.
\par The earliest notice of it is contained in the 'Rh Ya, which,
\par with its usual brevity, simply informs us that the male is
\par called Fung and the female Hwang ; the commentator, Kwoh
\par P'oh, adding that the Shui Ying bird (felicitous and perfect
\par a synonym for it) has a cock's head, a snake's neck, a
\par swallow's beak, a tortoise's back, is of five different colours,
\par and more than six feet high. The ' Rh Ya Chen I, a later
\par and supplementary edition of the former work, quotes the
\par Shwoh Wan to the effect that the united name of the male
\par and female bird is Fung Hwang, and that Tso's commentary
\par on the 17th year of the Chao, says one appeared in the time
\par of the Emperor Che (dynastic title, Shaou Haou). The
\par THE CHINESE PHCEN1X. 367
\par FIG. W. TEMPLE MEDALS FKOM CHINA: DRAGON AND PHCENIX.
\par MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par original passage in the Tso Chuen is so interesting that I
\par quote in extenso Dr. Legge's translation of it :
\par " When my ancestor, Shaou-Haou Che, succeeded to the
\par kingdom, there appeared at that time a phoenix, and therefore
\par he arranged his government under the nomenclature of
\par birds, making bird officers, and naming them after birds.
\par There were so and so Phoenix bird, minister of the calendar ;
\par so and so Dark bird [the swallow], master of the equinoxes ;
\par so and so Pih Chaou [the shrike], master of the solstices;
\par so and so Green bird [a kind of sparrow], master of the
\par beginning (of spring and autumn) ; and so and so Carnation
\par bird [the golden pheasant], master of the close (of spring
\par and autumn). . . . The five Che [Pheasants] presided over
\par the five classes of mechanics.
\par 4 * So in previous reigns there had been cloud officers, fire
\par officers, water officers, and dragon officers, according to
\par omens."
\par I think there is some connection between this old usage
\par and the present or late system of tribe totems among the
\par North American Indians. Thus we have Snake, Tortoise,
\par Hare Indians, &c., and I hope some day to explain some
\par of the obscure and apparently impossible passages of the
\par Shan Hai King, in reference to strange tribes, upon what I
\par may call the totem theory.
\par The Kin King, a small work devoted to ornithology, and
\par professing to date back to the Tsin dynasty [A.D. 265 to
\par 317], opens its pages with a description of the Fung Hwang,
\par because, as it states, the Fung is the principal of the three
\par hundred and sixty different species of birds. According to
\par it, the Fung is like a swan in front and like a Lin behind ;
\par it enumerates its resemblances pretty much as the commentator
\par in the 'Eh Ya gives them ; but we now find a commencement
\par of extraordinary attributes. Thus the head is
\par supposed to have impressed on it the Chinese character
\par expressing virtue, the poll that for uprightness, the back
\par THE CHINESE PHCENIX. 369
\par that for humanity ; the heart is supposed to contain that of
\par sincerity, and the wings to enfold in their clasp that of
\par integrity ; its foot imprints integrity ; its low notes are
\par like a bell, its high notes are like a drum. It is said that
\par it will not peck living grass, and that it contains all the five .
\par colours.*
\par When it flies crowds of birds follow. When it appears,
\par the monarch is an equitable ruler, and the kingdom has
\par moral principles. It has a synonym, "the felicitous yen.
\par 19
\par According to the King Shun commentary upon the 'Eh Ya, it
\par is about six feet in height. The young are called Yoh Shoh,
\par and it is said that the markings of the five colours only
\par appear when it is three years of age.f
\par There appears to have been another bird closely related
\par to it, which is called the Lwan Shui. This, when first
\par hatched, resembles the young Fung, but when of mature age
\par it changes the five colours.
\par The Shdng Li Ten Wei I says of this, that when the world
\par is peaceful its notes will be heard like the tolling of a bell, Pien
\par Lwan [answering to our (t
\par ding-dong "]. During the Chao
\par dynasty it was customary to hang a bell on the tops of
\par vehicles, with a sound like that of the Lwan.]: From another
\par passage we learn that it was supposed to have different names
\par according to a difference in colour. Thus, when the head '
\par * Black, red, azure (green, blue, or black), white, yellow.
\par f Many species of bird do not attain their mature plumage until long
\par after they have attained adult size, as some among the gulls and birds
\par of prej . I think I am right in saying that some of these latter only
\par become perfect in their third year. We all know the story of the ugly
\par duckling, and the little promise which it gave of its future beauty.
\par J According to Dr. Williams, the Lwan was a fabulous bird described
\par as the essence of divine influence, and regarded as the embodiment of
\par every grace and beauty, and that the argus pheasant was the type
\par of it.
\par Dr. Williams says that it was customary to hang little bells from the
\par phcenix that marked the royal cars,
\par 24
\par 370 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par and wings were red it was called the red Fung ; when blue,
\par the Yu Siang ; when white, the Hwa Yih ; when black, the
\par Yin Chu ; when yellow, the To Fu. Another quotation is
\par to the effect that, when the Fung soars and the Lwan
\par flies upwards, one hundred birds follow them. It is also
\par stated that when either the Lwan or the Fung dies, one
\par hundred birds peck up the earth and bury them.
\par Another author amplifies the fancied resemblances of the
\par Fung, for in the Lun Yu Tseh Shwai Shing we find it stated
\par that it has six resemblances and nine qualities. The former
\par are : 1st, the head is like heaven ; 2nd, the eye like the
\par sun ; 3rd, the back is like the moon ; 4th, the wings like
\par the wind ; 5th, the foot is like the ground ; 6th, the tail is
\par like the woof. The latter are : 1st, the mouth contains
\par commands ; 2nd, the heart is conformable to regulations ;
\par 3rd, the ear is thoroughly acute in hearing ; 4th, the tongue
\par utters sincerity ; 5th, the colour is luminous ; 6th, the comb
\par resembles uprightness ; 7th, the spur is sharp and curved ;
\par 8th, the voice is sonorous ; 9th, the belly is the treasure of
\par literature.
\par When it crows, in walking, it utters "
\par Quai she
\par "
\par [returning
\par joyously] ; when it stops crowing,
\par " T'i fee" [I carry
\par assistance?]; when it crows at night it exclaims " Sin
\par "
\par [goodness] ; when in the morning,
\par " Ho si
\par "
\par [I congratulate
\par the world] ; when during its flight, "Long Tu che wo "
\par [Long
\par Tu knows me] and " Hwang che chu sz si" [truly Hwang
\par has come with the Bamboos].* Hence it was that Confucius
\par wished to live among the nine I [barbarian frontier countries]
\par following the Fung's pleasure.
\par The Fung appears to have been fond of music, for, according
\par to the Shu King, when you play the flute, in nine cases
\par out of ten the Fung Wang comes to bear you company ;
\par while, according to the Odes, or Classic of Poetry, the Fung,
\par * In reference to Hwang Ti (?) writing the Bamboo Books ?
\par THE CHINESE PHCENIX. 371
\par in flying, makes the sound hwui hwui, and its wings carry
\par it up to the heavens ; and when it sings on the lofty mountain
\par called Kwang, the Wu Tung tree flourishes,* and its
\par fame spreads over the world.
\par The presence of the Fung was always an auspicious augury,
\par and it was supposed that when heaven showed its displeasure
\par at the conduct of the people during times of drought,
\par of destruction of crops by insects (locusts), of disastrous
\par famines, and of pestilence, the Fung Wang retired from the
\par civilised country into the desert and forest regions.
\par It was classed with the dragon, the tortoise, and the
\par unicorn as a spiritual creature, and its appearance in the
\par gardens and groves denoted that the princes and monarch
\par were equitable, and the people submissive and obedient.
\par Its indigenous home is variously indicated. Thus, in the
\par Shan Hai King, it is stated to dwell in the Ta Hueh mountains,
\par a range included in the third list of the southern
\par mountains ; it is also, in the third portion of the same work
\par (treating of the Great Desert), placed in the south and in
\par the west of the Great Desert, and more specifically as west
\par of Kwan Lun.
\par There is also a tradition that it came from Corea ; and
\par the celebrated Chinese general, Sieh Jan Kwei, who invaded
\par and conquered that country in A.D. 668, is said to have
\par ascended the Fung Hwang mountain there and seen the
\par phoenix.
\par According to the Annals of the Bamboo Books phoenixes,
\par male and female, arrived in the autumn, in the seventh
\par month, in the fiftieth year of the reign of Hwang Ti (B.C.
\par 2647), and the commentary states that some of them abode
\par * The Wu Tung is the Eleococca verrucosa, according to Dr. Williams ;
\par others identify it with the Sterculia platanifolia. There is a Chinese
\par proverb to the effect that without having Wu Tung trees you cannot
\par expect to see phcenixes in your garden.

\par in the Emperor's eastern garden ; some built their nests
\par about the corniced galleries (of the palaces), and some sung
\par in the courtyard, the females gambolling to the notes of the
\par males.
\par The commentary of the same work adds that (among a
\par variety of prodigies) the phoenix appeared in the seventieth
\par year of the reign of Yaou (B.C. 2286), and again in the first
\par year of Shun (B.C. 2255).
\par Kwoh P'oh states that, during the times of the Han
\par dynasty (commencing B.C. 206 and lasting until A.D. 23),
\par the phoenixes appeared constantly.
\par In these later passages I have adopted the word phoenix,
\par after Legge and other Sinologues, as a conventional admission
\par ; but, as will be seen from all the extracts given, there
\par are but few grounds for identifying it, whether fabulous or
\par not, with the phoenix of Greek mythology. It reappears in
\par Japanese tradition under the name of the Ho and (male
\par and female), and, according to Kempfer, who calls it the
\par Foo,
\par " it is a chimerical but beautiful large bird of paradise,
\par of near akin to the phoenix of the ancients. It dwells in
\par the high regions of the air, and it hath this in common with
\par the Ki-Rin (the equivalent of the Chinese Ki-Lin), that it
\par never comes down from thence but upon the birth of a sesin
\par (a man of incomparable understanding, penetration, and
\par benevolence) or that of a great emperor, or upon some
\par such other extraordinary occasion."
\par It is a common ornamentation in the Japanese temples ;
\par and I select, as an example, figures from some very beautiful
\par panels in the Nichi-hong-wanji temple in Kioto. They
\par depart widely from the original (Chinese) tradition, every
\par individual presenting a different combination of gorgeous
\par colours; they only agree in having two long central tail
\par feathers projecting from a plumose, bird-of-paradise-like
\par arrangement.
\par These can only be accepted as the evolution of an artist's
\par THE CHINESE PHCENIX. 373
\par fancy ; nor can any opinion be arrived at from the figure of
\par it illustrating the 'Eh Ya, of which I reproduce a fac-simile.
\par I have already stated that Kwoh P'oh's illustrations have been
\par lost.

\par Heng, otherwise styled Sien Tang ; it professes to be made
\par according to the designs of ancient books. The original is,
\par I believe, of some antiquity.
\par In this case the delineation of the bird shows a combination
\par of the characters of the peacock, the pheasant, and the
\par bird of paradise ; the comb is like that of a pheasant. The
\par tail is adorned with gorgeous eyes, like a peacock's, but
\par fashioned more like that of an argus pheasant, the two
\par middle tail feathers projecting beyond the others, while stiffened
\par plumes, as I interpret the intention of the drawing,
\par are made to project from the sides of the back, and above
\par the wings, recalling those of the Semioptera Wallacii. The
\par bird perches, in accordance with tradition, on the Wu-Tung
\par tree. Without pretending to assert that this is an exact
\par representation of the Tung, I fancy that it comes nearer to
\par it than the ordinary Chinese and Japanese representations.
\par Looking to the history of the appearance of the Fung,
\par the general description of its characteristics, and disregarding
\par the supernatural qualities with which, probably, Taouist
\par priests have invested it, I can only regard it as another

\par THE DELUGE TKADITION ACCOKDING TO BEKOSUS.*
\par "Obartes Elbaratutu being dead, his son Xisuthros (Khasisatra)
\par reigned eighteen sares (64,800 years). It was under him that the great
\par Deluge took place, the history of which is told in the sacred documents
\par as follows : Cronos (Ea) appeared to him in his sleep, and announced
\par that on the fifteenth of the month of Daisies the Assyrian month
\par Sivan a little before the summer (solstice) all men should perish by a
\par flood. He therefore commanded him to take the beginning, the middle,
\par and the end of whatever was consigned to writing, and to bury it in
\par the city of the Sun, at Sippara ; then to build a vessel and to enter it
\par with his family and dearest friends ; to place in this vessel provisions
\par to eat and drink, and to cause animals, birds, and quadrupeds to enter
\par it ; lastly, to prepare everything for navigation. And when Xisuthros
\par inquired in what direction he should steer his bark, he was answered
\par ' Toward the gods,' and enjoined to pray that good might come of it
\par for men.
\par "Xisuthros obeyed, and constructed a vessel five stadia long and
\par five broad ; he collected all that had been prescribed to him, and embarked
\par his wife, his children, and his intimate friends.
\par " The Deluge having come, and soon going down, Xisuthros loosed
\par some of the birds. These, finding no food nor place to alight on,
\par returned to the ship. A few days later Xisuthros again let them free,
\par but they returned again to the vessel, their feet full of mud. Finally,
\par loosed the third time, the birds came no more back.
\par " Then Xisuthros understood that the earth was bare. He made an

\par years after the Jews were carried captive to Babylon.

\par opening in the roof of the ship, and saw that it had grounded on the
\par top of a mountain. He then descended with his wife, his daughter,
\par and his pilot, who worshipped the earth, raised an altar, and there
\par sacrificed to the gods ; at the same moment he vanished with those who
\par accompanied him.
\par " Meanwhile those who had remained in the vessel, not seeing
\par Xisuthros return, descended too, and began to seek him, calling him
\par by his name. They saw Xisuthros no more ; but a voice from heaven
\par was heard commanding them piety towards the gods ; that he, indeed,
\par was receiving the reward of his piety in being carried away to dwell
\par thenceforth in the midst of the gods, and that his wife, his daughter,
\par and the pilot of the ship shared the same honour. The voice further
\par said that they were to return to Babylon, and, conformably to the
\par decrees of fate, disinter the writings buried at Sippara, in order to
\par transmit them to men. It added that the country in which they found
\par themselves was Armenia. These, then, having heard the voice, sacrificed
\par to the gods and returned on foot to Babylon. Of the vessel of
\par Xisuthros, which had finally landed in Armenia, a portion is still to be
\par found in the Gordyan mountains in Armenia, and pilgrims bring thence
\par asphalte that they have scraped from its fragments. It is used to
\par keep off the influence of witchcraft. As to the companions of Xisuthros,
\par they came to Babylon, disinterred the writings left at Sippara, founded
\par numerous cities, built temples, and restored Babylon."
\par The large amount of work done by the few followers of Xisuthros,
\par seems very surprising, but easily accounted for if we take the version
\par of the Deluge given by Nicolaus Damascenus (a philosopher and historian
\par of the age of Augustus, and a friend of Herod the Great).
\par " He mentions that there is a large mountain in Armenia, which
\par stands above the country of the Minyae, called Baris. To this it was
\par said that many people betook themselves in the time of the Deluge,
\par and were saved. And there is a tradition of one person in particular
\par floating in an ark, and arriving at the summit of the mountain."*

\par The dragon [which is perfectly fearless of beasts], when it hears
\par the noise of the wings of an eagle, immediately conceals itself in
\par hiding-places.
\par BOOK II. ch. 21.
\par Ethiopia generates dragons reaching thirty paces long; they have
\par no proper name, but they merely call them slayers of elephants, and
\par they attain a great age. So far do the ^Ethiopian accounts narrate.
\par The Phrygian history also states that dragons are born which reach
\par ten paces in length ; which daily in midsummer, at the hour when the
\par forum is full of men in assembly, are wont to proceed from their caverns,
\par and [near the river Rhyndacus], with part of the body on the ground,
\par and the rest erect, with the neck gently stretched out, and gaping
\par mouth, attract birds, either by their inspiration, or by some fascination,
\par and that those which are drawn down by the inhalation of their
\par breath glide down into their stomach [and that they continue this
\par until sunset,] but that after that, concealing themselves, they lay in
\par ambush for the herds returning from the pasture to the stable, and
\par inflict much injury, often killing the herdsmen and gorging themselves
\par with food.
\par BOOK VI. ch. 4.
\par When dragons are about to eat fruit they suck the juice of the
\par wild chicory, because this affords them a sovereign remedy against
\par inflation. When they purpose lying in wait for a man or a beast,
\par they eat deadly roots and herbs ; a thing not unknown to Homer, for
\par he makes mention of the dragon, who, lingering and twisting himself
\par in front of his den, devoured noxious herbs.

\par In India, as I am told, there is great enmity between the dragon
\par and elephant. Wherefore the dragons, aware that elephants are
\par accustomed to pluck off boughs from trees for food, coil themselves
\par beforehand in these trees, folding the tail half of their body round
\par the limbs, and leaving the front half hanging like a rope. When
\par an elephant approaches for the purpose of browsing on the young
\par branches, the dragon leaping on him, tears out his eyes, and then
\par squeezing his neck with his front part and lashing him with his tail,
\par strangles him in this strange kind of noose.

\par In Idumea, or Judaea, during Herod's power, according to the
\par statement of the natives of the country, a very beautiful, and just
\par adolescent, woman, was beloved by a dragon of exceptional magnitude ;
\par who visited her betimes and slept with her as a lover. She, indeed,
\par although her lover crept towards her as gently and quietly as lay in
\par his power, yet utterly alarmed, withdrew herself from him ; and to the
\par end that a forgetfulness of his passion might result from the absence
\par of his mistress, absented herself for the space of a month.
\par But the desire of the absent one was increased in him, and his
\par amatory disposition was daily so far aggravated that he frequently
\par came both by day and night to that spot, where he had been wont to
\par be with the maiden, and when unable to meet with his inamorata,
\par was afflicted with a terrible grief. After the girl returned, angry at
\par being, as it were spurned, he coiled himself round her body, and softly
\par and gently chastised her on the legs.
\par BOOK VI. ch. 63.
\par A dragon whelp, born in Arcadia, was brought up with an Arcadian
\par child ; and in process of time, when both were older, they entertained a
\par mutual affection for one another. The friends of the boy, seeing how
\par the dragon had increased in magnitude in so short a time, carried him,
\par while sleeping with the boy in the same bed, to a remote spot, and,
\par leaving him there, brought the boy back. The dragon thereon remained
\par in the wood [feeding on growing plants and poisons], preferring a solitary
\par life to one in towns and [human] habitations. Time having rolled
\par on, and the boy having attained youth, and the dragon maturity, the
\par former, while travelling upon one occasion through the wilds in the
\par neighbourhood of his friend, fell among robbers, who attacked him
\par with drawn swords, and being struck, either from pain, or in the hopes
\par APPENDIX II. 379
\par of assistance, cried out. The dragon being a beast of acute hearing and
\par sharp vision, as soon as he heard the lad with whom he had been brought
\par up, gave a hiss in expression of his anger, and so struck them with fear,
\par that the trembling robbers dispersed in different directions, whom
\par having caught, he destroyed by a terrible death. Afterwards, having
\par cared for the wounds of his ancient friend, and escorted him through
\par the places infested with serpents, he returned to the spot where he
\par himself had been exposed not showing any anger towards him on
\par account of his having been expelled into solitude, nor because ill-feeling
\par men had abandoned an old friend in danger.

\par Hegemon, in his Dardanic verses, among other things mentions,
\par concerning the Thessalian Alevus, that a dragon conceived an affection
\par for him. Alevus possessed, as Hegemon states, golden hair,
\par which I should call yellow, and pastured cattle upon Ossa near the
\par Thessalian spring called Hsemonium [as Anchises formerly did on
\par Ida]. A dragon of great size fell violently in love with him, and
\par used to crawl up gently to him, kiss his hair, cleanse his face by
\par licking it with his tongue, and bring him various spoils from the
\par chase.

\par Beyond the Oasis of Egypt there is a great desert which extends
\par for seven days' journey, succeeded by a region inhabited by the Cynoprosopi,
\par on the way to .^Ethiopia. These live by the chase of goats
\par and antelopes. They are black, with the head and teeth of a dog, of
\par which animal, in this connection, the mention is not to be looked upon
\par as absurd, for they lack the power of speech, and utter a shrill hissing
\par sound, and have a beard above and below the mouth like a dragon ;
\par their hands are armed with strong and sharp nails, and the body is
\par equally hairy with that of dogs.

\par Lycaonus, King of Emathia, had a sou named Macedon, from
\par whom eventually the country was called, the old name becoming obsolete.
\par Now, one of Macedon's sons, named Pindus, was indued both with
\par strength of mind and innate probity, as well as a handsome person,
\par whereas his other children were constituted with mean minds and less
\par vigorous bodies.
\par When, therefore, these latter perceived Pindus' s virtue and other
\par gifts, they not only oppressed him, but in the end ruined themselves in
\par punishment for so great a crime.
\par Pindus, perceiving that plots were laid for him by his brothers,
\par abandoning the kingdom which he had received from his father, and
\par 380 MYTHICAL MONSTEES.
\par being robust and taking pleasure in hunting, not only took to it himself,
\par but led the others to follow his example.
\par Upon one occasion he was pursuing some young mules, and, spurring
\par his horse to the top of its powers, drew away a long distance from
\par those who were hunting with him. The mules passing into a deep
\par cavern, escaped the sight of their pursuer, and preserved themselves
\par from danger. He leaped down from the horse, which he tied to the
\par nearest tree, and whilst he was seeking with his utmost ability to discover
\par the mules, and probing the dens with his hands, heard a voice
\par warning him not to touch the mules. Wherefore, when he had long
\par and carefully looked about, and could see no one, he feared that the
\par voice was the result of some greater cause, and, mounting his horse,
\par left the place. On the next day he returned to the spot, but, deterred
\par by the remembrance of the voice he had heard, he did not enter the
\par place where they had concealed themselves.
\par When, therefore, he was cogitating as to who had warned him from
\par following his prey, and, as it appeared, was looking out for mountain
\par shepherds, or hunters, or some cottage a dragon of unusual magnitude
\par appeared to him, creeping softly with a great part of its body, but
\par raising up its neck and head a little way, as if stretching himself
\par but his neck and head were of such height as to equal that of the tallest
\par man.
\par Although Pindus was alarmed at the sight, he did not take to flight,
\par but, rallying himself from his great terror, wisely endeavoured to appease
\par the beast by giving him to eat the birds he had caught, as the price of
\par his redemption.
\par He, cajoled by the gifts and baits, or, as I may say, touched, left the
\par spot. This was so pleasing to Pindus, that, as an honourable man,
\par and grateful for his escape, he .carried to the dragon, as a thankoffering,
\par whatever he could procure from his mountain chases, or by
\par fowling.
\par Nor were these gifts from his booty without return, for fortune
\par became immediately more favourable to him, and he achieved success
\par in all his hunting, whether he pursued ground or winged game.
\par Wherefore he achieved a great reputation, both for finding and quickly
\par catching game.
\par Now, he was so tall that he caused terror from his bulk, while from
\par his excellent constitution and beautiful countenance he inflamed women
\par with so violent an affection for him, that the unmarried, as if they
\par were furious and bacchantes, joined his hunting expeditions; and
\par married women, under the guardianship of husbands, preferred passing
\par their time with him, to being reported among the number of goddesses.
\par And, for the most part, men also esteemed him highly, as his virtue
\par and appearance attracted universal admiration. His brothers only held
\par a hostile and inimical feeling towards him. Wherefore upon a certain
\par APPENDIX II. 381
\par occasion they attacked him from an ainbush, when he was hunting
\par alone, and having driven him into the denies of a river close by, when
\par he was removed from all help, attacked him with drawn swords and
\par slew him.
\par When the dragon heard its friend's outcries (for it is an animal with
\par as sharp a sense of hearing as it has quickness of vision), it issued from
\par its lair, and at once, casting its coils round the impious wretches,
\par suffocated them.
\par It did not desist from watching over its slain [friend] with the
\par utmost care, until those nearest related to the deceased came to him,
\par as he was lying on the ground ; but nevertheless, although clad in
\par proper mourning, they were prevented through fear of the custodian
\par from approaching and interring the dead with proper rites, until it,
\par understanding from its profound and wonderful nature, that it was
\par keeping them at a distance, quietly departed from its guard and station
\par near the body, in order that it might receive the last tokens of esteem
\par from the bystanders without any interruption.
\par Splendid obsequies were performed, and the river where the murder
\par was effected received its name from the dead man.
\par It is therefore a peculiarity of these beasts to be grateful to those
\par from whom they may have received favours.
\par BOOK XI. ch. 2. Dragon Sacred to Apollo.
\par The Epirotes, both at home and abroad, sacrifice to Apollo, and
\par solemnise with extreme magnificence a feast yearly in his honour,
\par There is a grove among them sacred to the god, and inclosed with a
\par wall, within which are dragons, pleasing to the god. Hither a sacred
\par virgin comes alone, naked, and presents food to the dragons. The
\par Epirotes say that these are descended from the Delphic python. If
\par they regarded the virgin ministering to them with favour, and took the \\
\par food promptly, they were believed to portend a fertile and healthful
\par year ; if they were rude towards her, and would not accept the proffered
\par food, some predicted, or at least expected, the contrary for the coming
\par year.
\par BOOK II. ch. 16. Dragon in Lavinium.
\par There is a peculiar divination of the dragon, for in Lavinium, a town
\par of the Latins but in Lavinium, there is a large and dense sacred grove,
\par and near it the shrine of the Argolic Juno. Within the grove is a cave
\par and deep den, the lair of a dragon.
\par Sacred virgins enter this grove on stated days, who carry a barley
\par cake in their hands, with bandaged eyes. A certain divine afflatus
\par leads them accurately to the den, and gently, and step by step, they
\par proceed without hindrance, and as if their eyes were uncovered. If
\par they are virgins, the dragon admits the food as pure and fit for a deity.
\par 382 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par If otherwise, it does not touch, it, perceiving and divining them to be
\par impure.
\par Ants, for the sake of cleansing the place, carry from the grove the
\par cake left by the vitiated virgin, broken into little pieces, so that they
\par may easily carry it. When this happens, it is perceived by the inhabitants,
\par and those who have entered are pointed out and examined, and
\par whoever proves to have forfeited her virginity is punished with the
\par penalties appointed by the laws.
\par " The masculine sex also seems to be privileged by nature among
\par brutes, inasmuch as the male dragon is distinguished by a crest and
\par hairs, with a beard."
\par BOOK XVI. ch. 39.
\par Onesicritus Astypalseus writes that there were two dragons in India
\par [nurtured by an Indian dancer], one of forty-six and the other of eighty
\par cubits, and that Alexander (Philip's son) earnestly endeavoured to see
\par them. It is affirmed in Egyptian books that, during the reign of Philadelphus,
\par two dragons were brought from Ethiopia into Philadelphia
\par alive, one forty, the other thirty cubits in magnitude.
\par Three were also brought in the time of King Evergetis, one nine and
\par another seven cubits. The Egyptians say that the third was preserved
\par with great care in the temple of ^Esculapius.
\par It is also said that there are asps of four cubits in length. Those
\par who write the history of the affairs of Chios say that a dragon of
\par extreme magnitude was produced in a valley, densely crowded and
\par gloomy with tall trees, of the Mount Pelienaeus in that island, whose
\par hissing struck the Chians with horror.
\par As none either of the husbandmen or shepherds . dare, by approaching
\par near, estimate its magnitude, but from its hissing judged it to be
\par a large and formidable beast, at length its size became known by a
\par remarkable accident. For the trees of the valley being struck by a
\par very strong wind, and the branches ignited by the friction, a great
\par fire thence arising, embraced the whole spot, and surrounded the
\par beast, which, being unable to escape, was consumed by the ardour of
\par the flame. By these means all things were rendered visible in the
\par denuded place, and the Chians freed, from their alarms, came to investigate,
\par and lighted on bones of unusual magnitude, and an immense
\par head, from which they were enabled to conjecture its dimensions when
\par living.
\par BOOK XI. ch. 17.
\par Homer was not rash in his line,
\par Terrible are the gods when they manifest themselves.
\par For the dragon, while sacred and to be worshipped, has within himself
\par something still more of the divine nature of which it is better to remain
\par in ignorance.
\par APPENDIX II. 383
\par Indeed, a dragon received divine honours in a certain tower in
\par Melita in Egypt. He had his priests and ministers, his table and
\par bowl. Every day they filled the bowl with flour kneaded with honey,
\par and went away ; returning on the following day, they found the bowl
\par empty.
\par Upon one occasion, a man of illustrious birth, who entertained an
\par intense desire of seeing the dragon, having entered alone, and placed
\par the food, went out ; and when the dragon commenced to feed at the
\par table, he opened suddenly and noisily the doors, which according to
\par custom he had closed.
\par The dragon indignantly left ; but he who had desired to see him, to
\par his own destruction, being seized with an affliction of the mind, and
\par having confessed his crime, presently lost his speech, and shortly after
\par died.
\par BOOK XII. ch. 39.
\par When Halia, the daughter of Sybasis, had entered the grove of
\par Diana in Phrygia, a certain sacred dragon of large size appeared and
\par copulated with her ; whence the Ophiogense deduce the origin of their
\par race.
\par BOOK XV. ch. 21. Concerning the Indian Dragon.
\par Alexander (while he attacked or devastated some portions of India,
\par and also seized others), lighted on, among other numerous animals, a
\par dragon, which the Indians, because they considered it to be sacred, and
\par worshipped it with great reverence, in a certain cave, besought him
\par with many entreaties to let alone, which he agreed to. However, when
\par the dragon heard the noise made by the passing army (for it is an
\par animal endowed with a very acute sense of hearing as well as of vision) ,
\par it frightened and alarmed them all with a great hissing and blowing.
\par It was said to be seventy cubits long.
\par It did not, however, show the whole of itself, but only exposed its
\par head from the cave. Its eyes were said to have been of the size (and
\par rotundity) of a Macedonian shield.

\par APPENDIX III.
\par ORIGINAL PREFACE TO " WONDERS BY LAND AND SEA "
\par ("SHAN HAI KING").
\par The Classic containing
\par " Wonders by Land and Sea " has been
\par praised by all who have read it, for its depth, greatness, far sightedness
\par and completeness ; since the narratives therein contained are all
\par wonderful and different from ordinary things. Moreover, the truth or
\par veracity of the book is a matter of doubt to nearly all men, and I therefore
\par think it fit that I should give my opinion on the subject. It has
\par been said by the philosopher Chuang that " the things that men do know
\par can in no way be compared, numerically speaking, to the things that are
\par unknown," thus in reading
\par " Wonders by Land and Sea," the force of
\par his remark becomes apparent to me.
\par Now, since heaven and earth are vast, it follows that the beings which
\par inhabit them must reasonably be numerous. The positive and negative
\par elements being heated by vernal warmth, produce myriads of
\par living beings of classes innumerable. When the essence of ether
\par combines, motion becomes apparent and generates into wondrous and
\par roving spirits, which, floating about and coming into contact with
\par anything, enter into it and thus create wonderful beings, whether
\par they be inhabitants of mountain or sea, or wood or stone; yea, so
\par numerous are they, that it is an impossible task for me to give them
\par in detail.
\par The evolution of the essence of the elements generates sound, which
\par by development produces a certain image. When we call a thing wonderful,
\par it is because we do not know the reasons attending its origin,
\par and what we do not call wonderful, we still are unaware why it is not
\par so. And why ? A thing is, per se, not wonderful, it is because we wish
\par to consider it so ; the wonder is in ourselves and not in the thing. For
\par instance, when a savage looks at the cotton cloth we wear, he calls it
\par hemp ; and when an inhabitant of Yiich (Soochow and vicinity) sees a
\par rug, he calls it fur or hair. The reason may be found in this : we
\par believe only those things to which we have been educated, and anyAPPENDIX
\par III. 385
\par thing which might not be perfectly understood by us we deem wonderful.
\par Hence the shortsightedness of human nature. I will now give
\par a passing remark of what is known amongst us. A place called Ping
\par Shui (?) produces fire, while the Yen mountain produces rats. Now all
\par men know these facts, and ^yet when we read and speak of the classic
\par treating of the " Wonders by Land and Sea," we call it wonderful !
\par When a thing is really wonderful, we do not consider it so ; and what is
\par not wonderful, we persist in considering it to be so. Such being the
\par case, if, what should be wondered at, we do not call it so, then there
\par cannot be a single wonder in the whole Universe ; and if we call a thing
\par wonderful which in truth is not so, then up to the present time there
\par can be nothing wonderful. Moreover, if what is unknowable appears
\par clear to our minds, it follows that all things on earth should be understood
\par by us.
\par According to the Bamboo Annals of Chi Chuen, and the records of
\par King Miih, it is said that when that King went to visit the Fairy
\par Queen of the West, he took with him as gifts to her, beautiful jade
\par stones, and the best of raw and embroidered silks ; while, on the other
\par hand, the Fairy Queen gave a banquet in honour of the King, on the
\par banks of the lake formed by white jade stones. During the banquet
\par they composed and spoke their thoughts in verse, and the sentiments
\par embodied therein were beautiful. Then the royal pair repaired to the
\par hillock adjoining the Kiien Lun mountain, and roamed over the palaces
\par of King Hsiien Yuan, which were situated there, and thence to the
\par artificial terraces of the Chung hill, and gazed on the precious and
\par wonderful things collected by that king. Returning to the residence
\par of the Fairy Queen, King Miih had a stone tablet engraved recording
\par the event, and erected it in the Queen's magic garden. On King
\par Miih's return home, he brought with him to the Middle Kingdom
\par beautiful wood and magnificent flowers, precious stones and elegant
\par jades, golden oils and silver candles. In his travels, King Miih rode
\par in a chariot drawn by eight splendid horses ; the right-hand horses
\par were of a dark colour, while those on the left hand were greenish.
\par Tsao Fu was the charioteer, and Pen Yung, who stood on the King's
\par right, was the body-guard. Myriads of Us could thus be traversed.
\par They went over barren wastes and over celebrated mountains and large
\par rivers, yet none of them barred their onward course. To the east
\par they came across the Halls of the G-iants ; to the west they arrived at
\par the mansions of the Fairy Queen ; to the south they crossed over a
\par bridge composed of immense tortoises ; and to the north they drove
\par over streets made of layers of feathers. Traversing these, then, King
\par Miih commenced his journey homeward full of joy. History informs
\par us that "
\par King Miih, riding in a chariot drawn by eight magnificent
\par horses, with Tsao Fu as charioteer, made a journey to the west, in
\par search of adventures in hunting, and, coming to the Fairy Queen of
\par 25
\par 386 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par the West, was so happy, that he almost forgot to return home." These
\par words are similar to those recorded in the " Bamboo Annals "
\par of Chi
\par Chuen. The classic called "
\par Spring and Autumn," says that "
\par King
\par Miih was a man of vast ambition, and desired that the whole world
\par should bear the tracks of his cart-wheels, and receive the imprints of
\par his horse's hoof," and the " Bamboo Annals "
\par illustrate this ambition.
\par The disciples of Ts'ian Chow were all eminent scholars of famous
\par attainments, but they were all sceptical as to the veracity of the adventures
\par of King Miih, and say that in looking over history they are convinced
\par of their fallacy. Sz Ma Tseen also, in writing the preface to the
\par " Eecords of Ta Wan," says that when Chang Ch'ien went on his mission
\par to Ta Hsia, he traversed the whole length of the Huang Ho up to its
\par very source, but never came across the Kiien Lun mountain. Moreover,
\par Sz Ma Tseen in his own history also says, in referring to the " Book of
\par Wonders by Land and Sea," that, "As to the wonders described in
\par that work, I, for my part, dare not vouch for their truth." In the face,
\par therefore, of all these authorities, is it not a hard task for me to prove
\par the contrary ? If the " Bamboo Annals "
\par of a thousand years ago be
\par not taken at the present day as a truthful record of the past, then,
\par indeed, most of the narratives contained in the " Book of Wonders by
\par Land and Sea " must be false. Now, Tung Fang Shun knew of Pe
\par Fang ; Lin Tsz Chen proved satisfactorily the existence of Tao Chea
\par by a corpse from that kingdom. Wang Ch'i had an interview with men
\par having two distinct faces on their heads, and a man from the sea coast
\par picked up a dress having two very long sleeves. In carefully studying,
\par therefore, these books, I am convinced that their stories mainly coincide
\par with the tales in the " Book of Wonders by Land and Sea." Behold
\par these evidences then, ye who doubt, and place some credence in the
\par narrations contained in this book.
\par The Sage King made exhaustive researches into these wondrous
\par beings, and then drew their images. It is indeed impossible to hide
\par the existence of these wonders ! The " Book of Wonders by Land and
\par Sea" was compiled seven dynasties ago (up to the Tsin dynasty),
\par a space of 3,000 years. During the Han dynasty this book received
\par the closest attention, and was elucidated for the benefit of its readers ;
\par but shortly after it again fell into neglect. Moreover, since then, the
\par names of some mountains and rivers have undergone changes. At the
\par present day, teachers and expounders are unable to explain these

\par Fearing, therefore, that it will be entirely lost, I have written the

\par A MEMORIAL PRESENTED BY LIU HSITJ, BY ORDER OF
\par HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY THE EMPEROR, ON THE
\par "BOOK OF WONDERS BY LAND AND SEA."
\par The Memorialist, an officer of the Fourth Rank and Charioteer
\par to His Majesty the Emperor, having received commands to comment
\par upon and make right wonderful books, now reports that an officer
\par named Wang, a subordinate in the Board of Civil Office, had already
\par made comments and set right thirty-two chapters of the "Book of
\par Wonders by Land and Sea," but which the memorialist has reduced to
\par eighteen chapters. This book was compiled during the time of the
\par three Emperors (Yao, Shun, and Yii). At that time there was a great
\par flood, insomuch that the people had no places to live, but only in caves
\par and holes in the rocks, and upon the tops of trees.
\par The father of Yii, by name K'un, being ordered by the Emperor
\par to assuage the floods, was unable to do so ; the Emperor Yao therefore
\par ordered Yii, the son, to do so. Yii used four things in his journey
\par around to make the floods flow away. He first cut away the trees on
\par high mountains to obtain a view of the surrounding country ; and having
\par settled as to which was the highest mountain, and which the largest
\par river, Yih and Peh Ye undertook to drive away the wild beasts and
\par birds abounding in the country, and named the mountains and rivers,
\par and classified the fauna of the country, and pointed out which was
\par water and which was land. The feudal lords assisted Yii in his work,
\par and thus he traversed the four quarters of the Empire, where footprint
\par of man seldom could be found, and where boats and carts scarcely
\par reached. He named the five mountain divisions of the Empire and
\par eight seas that bound it. He noted where each kind of precious stone
\par could be found, and the wonderful things he had seen. The abode of
\par animals of land and sea, flora of the country, birds of the air, and
\par beasts of the field, worms, the unicorn, and the phoenix, all these he
\par fixed, and also made known their hiding-places ; also the furthest
\par removed kingdom of the earth, and men who were different from
\par APPENDIX IV. 389
\par human beings. Yii divided the Empire into nine divisions, and determined
\par upon the tribute to be given by each division, and Yih and his
\par comrade noted which was hurtful and which was harmless for the
\par " Book of Wonders by Land and Sea."
\par All the deeds handed down to us of the sages are clearly noted
\par in the Maxims of the Ancients. The work therein expressed is a
\par matter that can be believed in. During the reign of Shiao Wu
\par there was commonly seen a rare bird, which would eat nothing.
\par Tung Fang Suh saw this bird, and gave its name ; he also told what
\par it would eat. His words being attended to, the bird ate what was given
\par it. Someone asked Suh how he knew of it ; he said he had read of the
\par bird in the " Book of Wonders by Land and Sea." During the reign
\par of Shiao Hsiien, a large stone was broken in Shang Chuen, which
\par then sank into the ground and displayed a house of stone ; in the house
\par was a man of Tao Chia, with his arms tied. At that time the memorialist's
\par father, named Hsiang, was a Censor, and he said that this
\par Tao Chia man was a traitor to his king. Being questioned by the Emperor
\par how he could know it, he said that he had read of it in the " Book
\par of Wonders by Land and Sea," which says,
\par " A traitor having killed his
\par king in Tao Yii, he was chained and confined in a mountain, his right
\par leg was cut off, and both his arms tied behind his back." The Emperor
\par was much surprised at this. All scholars acknowledge that this book
\par is perfectly wonderful, and all intelligent men should read it, and be
\par able to speak upon these wonderful beings and things, and learn the
\par customs of far-off kingdoms and their inhabitants. Hence the Yi
\par King says,
\par " In speaking of the products of the empire, care should be
\par taken to avoid confusion,'* and learned men, therefore, may not be
\par doubtful.

\par AFTEE PEEFACE TO THE " BOOK OF WONDEES BY
\par LAND AND SEA."
\par In the sayings of the philosopher Tso, the following remarks may
\par be found :
\par " Virtue existed during the times of the Hsia dynasty ;
\par drawings of all animals far and wide were made, and the metal from
\par which the urn was made, for the purpose of engraving thereon the
\par images of these animals, was presented as tribute by the feudal lords of
\par the Nine Kingdoms. This urn contained the images of all manner and
\par kinds of animals. This was for the purpose of letting the people know
\par about their existence, so that they might avoid them in entering the
\par mountains and forests, and the genii of the mountains and rivers.
\par Hence the object of the classic treating on the ' Wonders by Land and
\par Sea.'
\par " When Yii assuaged the floods, the Emperor presented him
\par with a red-coloured wand made of jadestones, and then abdicated his
\par throne in his favour ; on this account he ordered a tribute of metals
\par from the feudal lords of the Nine Kingdoms, wherewith to cast the urn,
\par on which were engraved all kinds of animals from far and wide, such
\par as the wonderful animals and beings of mountains, rivers, grass, and
\par wood, as well as the wonders to be found among walking animals and
\par inhabitants of the air. Yii, when Emperor, caused the forms of these
\par wonders to be described, how produced, and their natures ; he also had
\par them classified. When he had described those wonders, whether seen
\par or heard of, or common or uncommon, or rarely heard of, all these he
\par had described minutely, whereby, when the people heard of them, an
\par exceeding fear fell on them. All animals and beings that were common
\par in those days were described in the Annals of Yii, but such as were
\par wonderful and rare were engraved on the nine urns. These urns when
\par completed were placed in those parts of the empire where these
\par wonders originally came from, in order that the people of that age
\par might learn and see daily the things that were either heard of or seen
\par by others.
\par The things brought by tribute-bearers from afar were also added
\par APPENDIX V. 391
\par unto the nine urns. Indeed, this made wonders an ordinary matter.
\par That the people might learn these things was the idea of the sage
\par King Yii. Hence, even though at that time all things were described
\par honestly, still the works of that period are far deeper than those of the
\par Chow dynasty. At the time of the last Emperor of the Hsia dynasty,
\par the historiographer Chung Ku, fearing that that Emperor might destroy
\par the books treating of the ancient and present time, carried them in
\par flight to Yin. History also says that K'ung Kiah compiled into a book
\par all the things that were engraved on the vases and dishes from the
\par time of Hwang Ti and his ministers, Yao and Sz. And the Annals
\par treating on the animals described on the nine urns were due to such
\par men as Chung Ku and K'ung Kiah. These Annals are now known as
\par the classic treating on " Wonders by Land and Sea." The nine urns
\par were extinct at the time of Tsing, but the pictures and classic still
\par existed. During the Tsin dynasty, T'ao Chang and his school of poets
\par gazed upon the pictures of the " Wonders of Land and Sea." In the
\par " Seven Commentaries "
\par of the Yuen family, there is observed a case
\par of Chang Sun Yao's pictures of these wonders. These cases may be
\par cited as proofs of the authenticity of the wonders. At the present
\par time, the classic treating on these wonders still exists, but the pictures
\par have become extinct. This classic has been treated upon and commented
\par on and made intelligent by the people that have come after it,
\par insomuch that the names of different districts of the Tsing and Han
\par dynasties have been made to correspond with some of the names
\par mentioned in the " Book of Wonders by Land and Sea." Hence the
\par readers of this book are divided into the believing and the doubting.
\par The believers base their belief upon the fact that it was the Emperor
\par Yii who compiled it and explained its origin. The doubtful base their
\par doubt on the probable fact of the book having been written by people
\par who existed after Yu, and therefore unreasonable. This is indeed a
\par base calumny. Liu Hsiu of the Han dynasty makes mention of the
\par book in his seven chapters treating on it. And his style of composition
\par might be said to be very ancient. Kwoh P'oh of the Tsin dynasty
\par in his preface and notes on this book, states these wonders. The honour
\par of transmitting this book to posterity is due to Liu Hsiu and Kwoh
\par P'oh ; but, to prevent learners from considering that the notes made by
\par the two scholars are of no importance, I have therefore written this
\par preface.

\par EXTRACTS FROM "SOCIAL LIFE OF THE CHINESE,"
\par BY JUSTUS DOOLITTLE.
\par Ch. II., p. 264.
\par " The dragon holds a remarkable position in the history and government
\par of China. It also enjoys an ominous eminence in the affections
\par of the Chinese people. It is frequently represented as the great benefactor
\par of mankind. It is the dragon which causes the clouds to form
\par and the rain to fall. The Chinese delight in praising its wonderful
\par properties and powers. It is the venerated symbol of good.
\par " The Emperor appropriates to himself the use of the true dragon,
\par the one which has five claws on each of its four feet. On his dress of
\par state is embroidered a likeness of the dragon. His throne is styled
\par 'the dragon's seat/ His bedstead is the l
\par dragon's bedstead.' His
\par countenance is ' the dragon's face.' His eyes are ' the dragon's eyes.'
\par '\\ His beard is ' the dragon's beard.'
\par " The true dragon, it is affirmed, never renders itself visible to mortal
\par vision wholly at once. If its head is seen, its tail is obscured or hidden.
\par If it exposes its tail to the eyes of man, it is careful to keep its head
\par out of sight. It is always accompanied by or enshrouded in, clouds,
\par when it becomes visible in any of its parts. Water-spouts are
\par believed by some Chinese to be occasioned by the ascent and descent of
\par the dragon. Fishermen and residents on the border of the ocean are
\par reported to catch occasional glimpses of the dragon ascending from the
\par water and descending to it.
\par " It is represented as having scales, and without ears ; from its forehead
\par two horns project upwards. Its organ of hearing seems to be
\par located in these horns, for it is asserted that it hears through them. It
\par is regarded as the king of fishes.
\par Proclamations emanating directly from the Emperor, and published
\par on yellow paper, sometimes have the likenesses of two dragons facing
\par each other, and grasping or playing with a pearl, of which the dragon
\par is believed to be very fond.
\par APPENDIX VI. 393
\par Oh. II. p. 338.
\par " The sagacious geomancer is also careful to observe the mountain or
\par hill on the right and left sides of the spot for a lucky grave. The lefthand
\par side is called the black dragon ; the right-hand side is called
\par the white tiger. The lucky prospects, in a Chinese sense, on the hills
\par situated to the left, should clearly surpass the prospects of the hills
\par on the right. And the reason for this is manifest, for the black dragon
\par is naturally weaker than the white tiger.
\par Ch. I. pr. 275.
\par " The common belief is that the dragon and the tiger always fight
\par when they meet ; and that when the dragon moves, the clouds will
\par ascend and rain will soon fall.
\par "
\par Hence, in a time of drought, if the bones of a tiger should be let
\par down into this well called the '
\par dragon's well,' and kept there for three
\par days at the most, there will, it is sagely affirmed, most likely be rain
\par soon.

\par EXTEACTS FKOM THE " PAN TSAOU KANG MU."
\par THE KiAO-LuNG. (The four-footed coiled Dragon. The Iguanodon.
\par Eitel.)
\par This animal, according to Shi Chan, belongs to the dragon family.
\par Its eye-brows are crossed, hence its name signifies
\par " the crossed reptile."
\par The scaled variety is called the Xiao-Lung, the winged the Ying-Lung.
\par The horned kind are called K'iu, the hornless kind Li. In Indian
\par books it is called Kwan-P'i-Lo.
\par Shi Chan, quoting from the Kwan Cheu Ki, says :
\par " The Iguanodon (?)
\par is more than twelve feet long ; it resembles a snake, it has four feet,
\par and is broad like a shield. It has a small head and a slender neck, the
\par latter being covered with numerous protuberances. The front of its
\par breast is of a red colour, its back is variegated with green, and its sides
\par as if embroidered. Its tail is composed of fleshy rings ; the larger ones
\par are several. Its eggs are also large. It can induce fish to fly, but if a
\par turtle is present they will not do so.
\par " The Emperor Chao, of the Han, when fishing in the river Wei,
\par caught a white Iguanodon. It resembled a snake, but was without
\par scales. Its head was composed of soft flesh, and tusks issued from the
\par mouth. The Emperor ordered his ministers to get it preserved. Its
\par flesh is delicious ; bones green, flesh red."
\par From the above it may be seen the Iguanodon is edible.
\par THE CEOCODILE.
\par "The T'o Fish, we call it the Earth Dragon, and have correctly
\par written the character. It resembles the dragon, its voice is terrible,
\par APPENDIX VII. 395
\par and its length is a ctiang (a hundred and forty-one English inches).
\par When it breathes it forms clouds, which condense into rain. Being
\par a dragon, the term ' fish ' should be done away with."
\par Shi Chan says the To character in appearance resembles the head,
\par the belly, and the tail. One author says that an animal, which is
\par identified with the crocodile, is found in the lagoons and marshes of
\par the Southern Sea, at no fixed time. Its skin is made into drums. It
\par is very tenacious of life. Before it can be flayed quantities of boiling
\par water have to be poured down its throat. Another author states that
\par the crocodile is of a sleepy disposition, with the eyes (nearly) always
\par shut. It is of immense strength. It frequently dashes itself against
\par the river bank. Men dig them out of their caves. If a hundred men
\par dig them out, a hundred men will be required to pull them out ; but if
\par one man dig, one man may pull them out ; but the event in either case
\par is very uncertain. Another author states that recently there were found
\par in the lakes and estuaries many animals resembling lizards and pangolins
\par in appearance, which utter dreadful cries during the night, to the
\par great terror of sailors. Shi Chan says crocodiles' dens are very deep,
\par and that bamboo ropes are baited in order to catch him ; after he has
\par swallowed the bait he is gradually pulled out. He flies zigzag, but
\par cannot fly upwards. His roar is like a drum's, and he responds to the
\par striking of the watches of the night, which is called the crocodile drum,
\par or the crocodile watch. The common people, when they hear it, predict
\par rain. The nape of the neck is bright and glistening, more brilliant
\par than those of fish. It lays a large number of eggs, as many as a
\par hundred, which it sometimes eats. The people of the South appreciate
\par the flesh, and use it at marriage festivities. One author states that the
\par crocodile has twelve different varieties of delicious flesh ; but the tail,
\par like serpent's flesh, is very poisonous. The crocodile's flesh cures quite
\par a host of diseases.
\par THE JAN SHE, or SOUTHEEN SNAKE. (Mai-Teu-She= closed up
\par (concealed) head snake.)
\par Shi Chan says :
\par " This snake is a reptile (having a wriggling motion).
\par Its body is immense, and its motion is wrig-wriggling (jan-jan)* and
\par slow ; hence its name, Jan-She. Another author says its scales have
\par hair like moustaches (jan). It lives in Kwangtung and Kwangsi
\par (literally, South of the Hills). Those that do not lift their head are
\par the true kind ; in this way they were called the ' Concealed Head
\par Snake.'
\par "
\par *
\par Jan-jan means a gradual but imperceptible advance.
\par 396 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par Sung quotes T'ao Hung King to the effect that its habitat is in Tsinngan
\par (Fukien), and also Su Kung, who says that it is found in
\par Kweicheu and Kwangcheu, towards the south, at Kaocheu and Hoiin.
\par At several places in the south of the Hills they are still found. Hung
\par King says the large ones (in their coils ?) are several fathoms in circumference.
\par Those that walk without raising their heads are the
\par genuine ones. Those that conceal their heads are not genuine. Its
\par fat and gall can be mixed together. The large ones are more than a
\par foot in diameter and more than twelve feet long. It is a snake, but it
\par is short and bulky. Su Kung remarks that its form resembles a
\par mullet's and its head a crocodile's. Its tail is round and without scales.
\par It is very tenacious of life. The natives cut up its flesh into slices, and
\par esteem it as a great delicacy. Another says : When steeped in vinegar
\par the slices curl round the chop-sticks, and cannot be released ; but
\par when the chop-sticks are made of grass stems (mong'tsd), then it is
\par practicable.
\par Another says :
\par " This snake is a hundred and forty-four feet long ;
\par it often swallows a deer. When the deer is completely digested, then
\par it coils round a tree, when the bones of the deer in the stomach protrude
\par through the interstices of the scales. . . . If a woman's dress is
\par thrown towards it, it will coil round and will not stir."
\par Shi Chan, quoting "The Wonderful Eecords," says: "The boa is
\par sixty to seventy feet long, and four to five feet in circumference; the
\par smaller ones from thirty-six to forty-eight feet long. Their bodies are
\par striped like a piece of embroidery. In spring and summer it frequents
\par the recesses of forests, waiting for the deer, to devour them. When
\par the deer is digested the boa becomes fat. Someone says that it will
\par eat a deer every year."
\par Another author says :
\par " The boa, when it devours a deer or wild
\par boar, begins with the hind legs. The poisonous breath of the boa
\par comes in contact with the horns ; these fall off. The galls, the smaller
\par they are the better they are." Another says :
\par " Boas abound in Wang
\par Cheu (Kwangsi). The large ones are more than a hundred and forty
\par feet long. They devour deer, reducing the horns and bones to a pulp.
\par The natives use the dolishos and rattans to fill up the entrance to its
\par den. The snake, when it smells them, becomes torpid. They then dig
\par him out. Its flesh is a great delicacy. Its skin may be made into a
\par drum, and for ornamenting swords, and for making musical instruments."
\par The Tu Hang Chi says : "Eustic soldiers in Kwangsi, when capturing
\par boas, stick flowers in their heads, which when the snake observes, it
\par cannot move. They then come up to it and cut off its head. They then
\par wait till it exhausts itself by its jumping about and dies. They then take
\par it home and feast on it." Compare .ZBlian \\_De Naturd Animalium, lib.
\par vi. chap, xxi.] :
\par "
\par They hung before the mouth of the Dragon's den a
\par APPENDIX VII. 397
\par piece of stuff flowered with gold, which attracted the eyes of the beast,
\par till by the sound of soft music they lulled him to sleep, and then cut
\par off his head."
\par The Hhan Hai King says :
\par " The Pa snake can eat an elephant, the
\par bones of which, after three years, are got rid of. Gentlemen that eat
\par of this snake will be proof against consumption." Kwoh P'oh, in his
\par commentary, says the boa of to-day is identical with the Pa snake.

\par " When the dragon walks he is

\par The Kwang Ya says :
\par " When he has scales he is a Kiao* when he has

\par The Ming Wuli Kiai of the Odes says the dragon has horns at five
\par hundred years, at one thousand years he is a Ying-Lung.
\par The P'i Ya Kwang Yao says :
\par " The dragon has eighty-one scales. This
\par is nine times nine, nine is the yang (male principle). The dragon is

\par " Thunder is a dragon."
\par The Yuen-Ming-Pao section of the Ch'un ts'iu says :
\par " The dragons

\par " The summer winds arise and the dragon

\par In the Yuen-Shdn-K(

\par In the " Tso-K'i

\par " Yellow gold after one thousand years produces

\par The Twan-ying-t'u says :
\par " The yellow dragon is the chief of the four

\par obscure or manifest, short or long, alive or dead ; the king cannot drain
\par the pool and catch him. His intelligence and virtue are unfathomable ;
\par moreover he ensures the peaceful air, and sports in the pools." Again,
\par it says :
\par " The yellow dragon does not go in company, and does not live
\par in herds. He certainly waits for the wind and rain, and disports himself
\par in the azure air. He wanders in the wilds beyond the heavens. He
\par goes and comes, fulfilling the decree ; at the proper seasons if there is

\par is called Chuh-Lung. When he opens his eyes it is day, when he shuts
\par his eyes it is night. His body is three thousand li long.
\par The Shui-Jcing-chu says :
\par " The Yulung considers the autumn days as
\par night. But the dragon descends in the autumn and hibernates in the
\par deep pools ; how then can he say that autumn is night ?
\par "
\par It also says :
\par " There is a Jivine dragon in the vermilion pools at Kiao-chew. Whenever
\par there was a drought, the village people obstructed the upper tributaries
\par of the pool, and many fish died ; the dragon became enraged at
\par such times, and caused much rain."
\par The Kwah-ti-t'u says : "At the dragon pool there is a hill with four
\par lofty sides, and within them is a pool seven hundred li square ; a herd
\par of dragons live there, and feed upon the many different kinds of trees.
\par # See the description of the dragon from the P'au-Tsaou-Kang->/m

\par It is beyond Hwui-ki forty-five thousand li." Again, it says :
\par " If you
\par do not ride on a dragon you cannot reach the weak waters* of the Kwanlun
\par hill."
\par The Poh- Wuh-Chi says : "If you soak the dragon's flesh in an acid
\par (and eat it), you can write essays." Again, it says :
\par " The Tiao-sheh is
\par in form like a dragon, but smaller. It likes danger ; hence it is appointed
\par to guard decayed timber." Again, it says :
\par " The dragon lays
\par three eggs. The first is Ki-tiao. He goes ashore and cohabits with the
\par deer or deposits his semen at the water's edge, where it becomes
\par attached to passing boats or floating wood and branches. It appears
\par like a walnut, it is called Tsz-ckao flower, and constitutes what is mentioned
\par in the Tao-ch'u as dragon-salt." Again, it says :
\par " Below the
\par dragon-gate every year in the third month of spring, yellow carps, twof
\par fish, come from the sea, and all the streams, with speed to the contest.
\par But seventy-one can ascend the dragon- gate in a year ; when the first
\par one ascends the dragon-gate there is wind and rain. It is followed by
\par fire which burns his tail, and then he is a dragon."
\par The Shih-I-Ki says :
\par " East of the hills 'of Fang-chang there is a
\par dragon plain where there are dragon skins and bones like a mountain :
\par spread out they would cover one thousand five hundred acres. To meet
\par him when he sloughs his bones is like the birth of a dragon. Or it is
\par said the dragons constantly wrangle at this place. It is enriched with
\par blood like flowing water."
\par The 8huh-I-Ki says :
\par " In the Puning district there are the isles where
\par the dragons are buried. Fu-loo says the dragons shed their bones at
\par these isles, the water now contains many dragon-bones, in these mountains,
\par hills, peaks, and gorges. The dragons make the wind and rain.
\par There are dragons' bones everywhere, whether in the deep or shallow
\par places ; there are many in the ground. Teeth, horns, vertebral columns,
\par feet, it seems as though they are everywhere. The largest measure one
\par hundred feet or exceed one hundred feet. The smallest are two feet or
\par three or four inches. The bones are everywhere. Constantly when
\par looking for anything they are seen." Again, it says :
\par " It is told of the
\par Kuh mountains in Ki-cheu that when the dragon is a thousand years
\par old, he enters the mountains and casts his bones. Now there is a
\par dragon hill, from the midst of the hill issues the dragon's brains."
\par The K'ie-Lan Records at Loh-yang$ say :
\par " You cannot trust the hills
\par in the west. They are too cold. There is snow both winter and
\par summer. In the hills there is a pool where a bad dragon lives ; long
\par ago some merchants rested near the pool, until the dragon became
\par enraged, abused, and killed them. A priest, Pan-T'o, heard of it, and,
\par leaving his seat to the pupils, went to the kingdom of Wuchang to
\par * Waters of such specific gravity that even a feather would sink.

\par learn the Po-lo-man incantations ; he mastered them in four years,
\par and returned to his seat. He went to the pool and invoked the
\par dragon. The dragon was transformed into pa man, repented, and followed
\par the king. The king then removed." Again, it says":
\par " To the
\par west of the kingdom of Wuchang there is a pool in which the dragon
\par prince dwells. There is a monastery on the banks of the pool, in
\par which there are more than fifty priests. Whenever the dragon prince
\par does anything marvellous, the king comes and beseeches him, using
\par gold, precious stones, pearls, and valuables, throwing them into the
\par pool. Afterwards they are cast up and the priests gather them. This
\par monastery relies upon the dragon for food and clothing and the
\par means to assist people. Its name is
\par ' Dragon Prince Monastery.'
\par "
\par The Ts'i-ti records say there is a well in the city of Ch'ang-ping at
\par the brambles ; when the water is disturbed a spiritual dragon comes
\par and goes. So the city is called the dragon city.
\par The Shi-San-Tsin records say Ho-li has also the name Dragon
\par Gate. Great fish collect below it, in number one thousand. They
\par cannot ascend. If one ascends it is a dragon.v Those which do not
\par ascend are fish. Hence it is called the "
\par Pao-sai-lung-man. (Great
\par carp ascend the dragon gate and become dragons ; those which do not
\par ascend prick the forehead and strike the cheek.) Again, it says :
\par " The
\par Lung-sheu mountains are sixty li long ; the head enters the Wei waters,
\par the tail extends to the Fan streams. This head is two hundred feet
\par high ; his tail descends gradually to a height of fifty or sixty feet. It
\par is said that long ago a strange dragon came out from south of the
\par mountains to drink the Wei waters. The road he travelled became
\par mountain. Hence the name."
\par The Kiao-Cheu-Ki says :
\par " In Kiao-chiat Fung-ki-hien there is a dyke
\par with a dragon gate ; the water is one hundred fathoms deep. Great
\par fish ascend this gate and become dragons. Those which cannot pass,
\par strike the cheek and puncture the forehead, until the blood flows. This
\par water is continually like the Vermilion pool."
\par The annals of Hwa-yang say :
\par "
\par Only at Wu-ch'ing district does the
\par earth meet the gate of heaven ; the dragon which mounts to heaven and
\par does not reach it, falls dead to this place, hence when excavating you
\par find dragon-bones."
\par The I-Tung-Ghi says :
\par "
\par Twenty li west of Lin-fung-hien is a stone
\par dragon, among the cliffs is a rock like a dragon. In a year of drought
\par wash it, and it rains." Again, it says :
\par " At Yen-T'ang there is a pond
\par called Smoky Pond ; it is north-east of the city ten li. Its depth has
\par never been ascertained. It is reported that long ago a man caught a
\par white eel, and was about to cook it, when an old man said, 'This
\par is the dragon of the river Siang ; I fear calamity will follow.' The
\par man was angry, and, regarding the words as vain, proceeded. The
\par next day the whole village was submerged."
\par APPENDIX VIII. 403
\par The Kwoh-Shi-Pu says :
\par " At the time of the spring rains the carp
\par '
\par springs through the dragon gate and becomes transformed. At the
\par present time, in Fan-cheu of Shansi, there is a cave in the mountains ;
\par in it are many cast bones and horns of dragons. They are collected
\par for medicine, and are of five colours. It is recorded in the Ghwfen
\par that north of the Wu-t'ai hills, below the terrace, is Azure Dragon
\par Pool, about one-third of an acre in extent. The Buddhist books say
\par five hundred evil dragons are confined (here). Whenever it is mid-day
\par a thick mist gradually arises. A pure priest and candidates for the
\par priesthood may see it. If a nun or females approach then there is
\par great thunder, lightning, and tempest. If they come near the pool, he
\par certainly will belch forth poisonous breath and they will die at once.
\par Foreigners say that in Piolosz there is a spiritual dragon which goes
\par and comes among the granaries, When a servant comes for rice the
\par dragon vanishes. If the servant comes constantly for rice the dragon
\par does not suffer it. If there is no rice in the granaries, the servant worships
\par the dragon, and the granaries are filled."
\par Yuin-Ghu-Tsih records: " If one sees a dragon's egg in the lake or
\par river there will certainly be a flood."
\par The Nan-Pu-Sin-Shu says :
\par " The dragon's disposition is ferocious,
\par and he fears bees'-wax, loves jade, and the King-ts'mg delight to eat
\par the flesh of cooked sparrows. For this reason men who eat sparrows do
\par not cross the sea."
\par The Pah-mung-so-yen says :
\par " The perverse dragon, when rain is
\par wanted, sneaks away into old trees or into the beams of houses. The
\par thunder god pulls him out."
\par Wu-ch'an-tsah-ch'ao says :
\par " There is a great dragon which sloughed
\par his skin on the brink of the Great Lake. Insects come out from his
\par scaly armour. Instantly they are transformed into dragon-flies of a red
\par colour. If men gather them they get fever and ague. If men now-adays
\par see these red dragon-flies they call them dragon-armour, also
\par dragons' grandsons, and are unwilling to hurt them."
\par Pi-shu-suh-hwa says :
\par " In Suh-chan and Hang-cheu the twentieth day
\par of the fifth month is called the day of the separation of the dragons.
\par Therefore, in the fifth and sixth months, whenever there is thunder, and
\par the clouds crowd together, if they see a tail bent down, and stretching
\par to earth from among the clouds, moving like a serpent, they say,
\par ' The dragon is suspended.'
\par "
\par Tsu-tz say :
\par " The spiritual dragon leaves the water and dwells in the
\par dry place, and the mole, crickets, and ants annoy him."
\par Kung Sun Hung replied to Tung Fang Shoh, saying :
\par " Before the
\par dragon has ascended he is of assort with fish and turtles ; after he has
\par ascended the heavens his scales cannot be seen."
\par Siu Tsung Yuen answered an inquirer, sayingj:
\par " The Kiao-Lung
\par ascends to the heavenly fountain. He pervades the six regions (North,
\par 404 MYTHICAL MONSTERS.
\par South, East, West, Above, Below). He moistens all things. Shrimps
\par and the leech cannot depart one foot from the water."
\par The Shwoh-Wan says: "The Kiao belongs to the dragon species.
\par When a fish attains three thousand six hundred [years ?] it becomes a
\par Kiao ; on attaining this much the dragon flies away." Again, it says :
\par "
\par [Dragons] without horns are Kiao"
\par The P'i-Ya says :
\par " The Kiao's bones are green, and they can bring
\par their heads and tails together and constrict anything ; hence they are
\par called Kiao. A popular name for them is ' the horse's lasso.'
\par " Another
\par author says the Kiao's tail has fleshy rings ; they are able to compress
\par any creature, and then tear it with the head.
\par The Shuh-I-Ki says the eye-brows of a Kiao unite, and their uniting
\par is a proof that it is a Kiao.
\par The Siang-Shu (Book of Physiognomy) says that when the eye-brows
\par unite the epithet Kiao is applied, because the Kiao Shan has crossed
\par eye-brows.
\par The Yueh-kiu (Divisions of Seasons) says that the season of autumn
\par is unfavourable to the Kiao.
\par The Kia- Yu (Family Discourses) says that if a stream contains fish,
\par then no Kiao will stay in it.
\par Hwai-nan-tsze says that no two Kiao will dwell in one pool.
\par The Shan-Hai-King says the Kiao is like a dragon and snake, with a
\par small head and fine neck. The neck has white ornamentations on it.
\par The girth (?) is five cubits ; the eggs of the capacity of three catties ;
\par and it can swallow a man.
