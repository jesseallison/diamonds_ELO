\par 
\par 
\par Adam Salton sauntered into the Empire Club, Sydney, and found awaiting
\par him a letter from his grand-uncle.  He had first heard from the old
\par gentleman less than a year before, when Richard Salton had claimed
\par kinship, stating that he had been unable to write earlier, as he had
\par found it very difficult to trace his grand-nephew's address.  Adam was
\par delighted and replied cordially; he had often heard his father speak of
\par the older branch of the family with whom his people had long lost touch.
\par Some interesting correspondence had ensued.  Adam eagerly opened the
\par letter which had only just arrived, and conveyed a cordial invitation to
\par stop with his grand-uncle at Lesser Hill, for as long a time as he could
\par spare.
\par 
\par "Indeed," Richard Salton went on, "I am in hopes that you will make your
\par permanent home here.  You see, my dear boy, you and I are all that remain
\par of our race, and it is but fitting that you should succeed me when the
\par time comes.  In this year of grace, 1860, I am close on eighty years of
\par age, and though we have been a long-lived race, the span of life cannot
\par be prolonged beyond reasonable bounds.  I am prepared to like you, and to
\par make your home with me as happy as you could wish.  So do come at once on
\par receipt of this, and find the welcome I am waiting to give you.  I send,
\par in case such may make matters easy for you, a banker's draft for 200
\par pounds.  Come soon, so that we may both of us enjoy many happy days
\par together.  If you are able to give me the pleasure of seeing you, send me
\par as soon as you can a letter telling me when to expect you.  Then when you
\par arrive at Plymouth or Southampton or whatever port you are bound for,
\par wait on board, and I will meet you at the earliest hour possible."
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Old Mr. Salton was delighted when Adam's reply arrived and sent a groom
\par hot-foot to his crony, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, to inform him that his
\par grand-nephew was due at Southampton on the twelfth of June.
\par 
\par Mr. Salton gave instructions to have ready a carriage early on the
\par important day, to start for Stafford, where he would catch the 11.40 a.m.
\par train.  He would stay that night with his grand-nephew, either on the
\par ship, which would be a new experience for him, or, if his guest should
\par prefer it, at a hotel.  In either case they would start in the early
\par morning for home.  He had given instructions to his bailiff to send the
\par postillion carriage on to Southampton, to be ready for their journey
\par home, and to arrange for relays of his own horses to be sent on at once.
\par He intended that his grand-nephew, who had been all his life in
\par Australia, should see something of rural England on the drive.  He had
\par plenty of young horses of his own breeding and breaking, and could depend
\par on a journey memorable to the young man.  The luggage would be sent on by
\par rail to Stafford, where one of his carts would meet it.  Mr. Salton,
\par during the journey to Southampton, often wondered if his grand-nephew was
\par as much excited as he was at the idea of meeting so near a relation for
\par the first time; and it was with an effort that he controlled himself.  The
\par endless railway lines and switches round the Southampton Docks fired his
\par anxiety afresh.
\par 
\par As the train drew up on the dockside, he was getting his hand traps
\par together, when the carriage door was wrenched open and a young man jumped
\par in.
\par 
\par "How are you, uncle?  I recognised you from the photo you sent me!  I
\par wanted to meet you as soon as I could, but everything is so strange to me
\par that I didn't quite know what to do.  However, here I am.  I am glad to
\par see you, sir.  I have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of
\par miles; now I find that the reality beats all the dreaming!"  As he spoke
\par the old man and the young one were heartily wringing each other's hands.
\par 
\par The meeting so auspiciously begun proceeded well.  Adam, seeing that the
\par old man was interested in the novelty of the ship, suggested that he
\par should stay the night on board, and that he would himself be ready to
\par start at any hour and go anywhere that the other suggested.  This
\par affectionate willingness to fall in with his own plans quite won the old
\par man's heart.  He warmly accepted the invitation, and at once they became
\par not only on terms of affectionate relationship, but almost like old
\par friends.  The heart of the old man, which had been empty for so long,
\par found a new delight.  The young man found, on landing in the old country,
\par a welcome and a surrounding in full harmony with all his dreams
\par throughout his wanderings and solitude, and the promise of a fresh and
\par adventurous life.  It was not long before the old man accepted him to
\par full relationship by calling him by his Christian name.  After a long
\par talk on affairs of interest, they retired to the cabin, which the elder
\par was to share.  Richard Salton put his hands affectionately on the boy's
\par shoulders--though Adam was in his twenty-seventh year, he was a boy, and
\par always would be, to his grand-uncle.
\par 
\par "I am so glad to find you as you are, my dear boy--just such a young man
\par as I had always hoped for as a son, in the days when I still had such
\par hopes.  However, that is all past.  But thank God there is a new life to
\par begin for both of us.  To you must be the larger part--but there is still
\par time for some of it to be shared in common.  I have waited till we should
\par have seen each other to enter upon the subject; for I thought it better
\par not to tie up your young life to my old one till we should have
\par sufficient personal knowledge to justify such a venture.  Now I can, so
\par far as I am concerned, enter into it freely, since from the moment my
\par eyes rested on you I saw my son--as he shall be, God willing--if he
\par chooses such a course himself."
\par 
\par "Indeed I do, sir--with all my heart!"
\par 
\par "Thank you, Adam, for that."  The old, man's eyes filled and his voice
\par trembled.  Then, after a long silence between them, he went on: "When I
\par heard you were coming I made my will.  It was well that your interests
\par should be protected from that moment on.  Here is the deed--keep it,
\par Adam.  All I have shall belong to you; and if love and good wishes, or
\par the memory of them, can make life sweeter, yours shall be a happy one.
\par Now, my dear boy, let us turn in.  We start early in the morning and have
\par a long drive before us.  I hope you don't mind driving?  I was going to
\par have the old travelling carriage in which my grandfather, your
\par great-grand-uncle, went to Court when William IV. was king.  It is all
\par right--they built well in those days--and it has been kept in perfect
\par order.  But I think I have done better: I have sent the carriage in which
\par I travel myself.  The horses are of my own breeding, and relays of them
\par shall take us all the way.  I hope you like horses?  They have long been
\par one of my greatest interests in life."
\par 
\par "I love them, sir, and I am happy to say I have many of my own.  My
\par father gave me a horse farm for myself when I was eighteen.  I devoted
\par myself to it, and it has gone on.  Before I came away, my steward gave me
\par a memorandum that we have in my own place more than a thousand, nearly
\par all good."
\par 
\par "I am glad, my boy.  Another link between us."
\par 
\par "Just fancy what a delight it will be, sir, to see so much of England--and
\par with you!"
\par 
\par "Thank you again, my boy.  I will tell you all about your future home and
\par its surroundings as we go.  We shall travel in old-fashioned state, I
\par tell you.  My grandfather always drove four-in-hand; and so shall we."
\par 
\par "Oh, thanks, sir, thanks.  May I take the ribbons sometimes?"
\par 
\par "Whenever you choose, Adam.  The team is your own.  Every horse we use to-
\par day is to be your own."
\par 
\par "You are too generous, uncle!"
\par 
\par "Not at all.  Only an old man's selfish pleasure.  It is not every day
\par that an heir to the old home comes back.  And--oh, by the way . . . No,
\par we had better turn in now--I shall tell you the rest in the morning."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER II--THE CASWALLS OF CASTRA REGIS
\par 
\par 
\par Mr. Salton had all his life been an early riser, and necessarily an early
\par waker.  But early as he woke on the next morning--and although there was
\par an excuse for not prolonging sleep in the constant whirr and rattle of
\par the "donkey" engine winches of the great ship--he met the eyes of Adam
\par fixed on him from his berth.  His grand-nephew had given him the sofa,
\par occupying the lower berth himself.  The old man, despite his great
\par strength and normal activity, was somewhat tired by his long journey of
\par the day before, and the prolonged and exciting interview which followed
\par it.  So he was glad to lie still and rest his body, whilst his mind was
\par actively exercised in taking in all he could of his strange surroundings.
\par Adam, too, after the pastoral habit to which he had been bred, woke with
\par the dawn, and was ready to enter on the experiences of the new day
\par whenever it might suit his elder companion.  It was little wonder, then,
\par that, so soon as each realised the other's readiness, they simultaneously
\par jumped up and began to dress.  The steward had by previous instructions
\par early breakfast prepared, and it was not long before they went down the
\par gangway on shore in search of the carriage.
\par 
\par They found Mr. Salton's bailiff looking out for them on the dock, and he
\par brought them at once to where the carriage was waiting in the street.
\par Richard Salton pointed out with pride to his young companion the
\par suitability of the vehicle for every need of travel.  To it were
\par harnessed four useful horses, with a postillion to each pair.
\par 
\par "See," said the old man proudly, "how it has all the luxuries of useful
\par travel--silence and isolation as well as speed.  There is nothing to
\par obstruct the view of those travelling and no one to overhear what they
\par may say.  I have used that trap for a quarter of a century, and I never
\par saw one more suitable for travel.  You shall test it shortly.  We are
\par going to drive through the heart of England; and as we go I'll tell you
\par what I was speaking of last night.  Our route is to be by Salisbury,
\par Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Worcester, Stafford; and so home."
\par 
\par Adam remained silent a few minutes, during which he seemed all eyes, for
\par he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon.
\par 
\par "Has our journey to-day, sir," he asked, "any special relation to what
\par you said last night that you wanted to tell me?"
\par 
\par "Not directly; but indirectly, everything."
\par 
\par "Won't you tell me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if anything
\par strikes you as we go along, just run it in.  I shall understand."
\par 
\par So old Salton spoke:
\par 
\par "To begin at the beginning, Adam.  That lecture of yours on 'The Romans
\par in Britain,' a report of which you posted to me, set me thinking--in
\par addition to telling me your tastes.  I wrote to you at once and asked you
\par to come home, for it struck me that if you were fond of historical
\par research--as seemed a fact--this was exactly the place for you, in
\par addition to its being the home of your own forbears.  If you could learn
\par so much of the British Romans so far away in New South Wales, where there
\par cannot be even a tradition of them, what might you not make of the same
\par amount of study on the very spot.  Where we are going is in the real
\par heart of the old kingdom of Mercia, where there are traces of all the
\par various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became
\par Britain."
\par 
\par "I rather gathered that you had some more definite--more personal reason
\par for my hurrying.  After all, history can keep--except in the making!"
\par 
\par "Quite right, my boy.  I had a reason such as you very wisely guessed.  I
\par was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local
\par history occurred."
\par 
\par "What is that, if I may ask, sir?"
\par 
\par "Certainly.  The principal landowner of our part of the county is on his
\par way home, and there will be a great home-coming, which you may care to
\par see.  The fact is, for more than a century the various owners in the
\par succession here, with the exception of a short time, have lived abroad."
\par 
\par "How is that, sir, if I may ask?"
\par 
\par "The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra Regis, the
\par family seat of the Caswall family.  The last owner who lived here was
\par Edgar Caswall, grandfather of the man who is coming here--and he was the
\par only one who stayed even a short time.  This man's grandfather, also
\par named Edgar--they keep the tradition of the family Christian
\par name--quarrelled with his family and went to live abroad, not keeping up
\par any intercourse, good or bad, with his relatives, although this
\par particular Edgar, as I told you, did visit his family estate, yet his son
\par was born and lived and died abroad, while his grandson, the latest
\par inheritor, was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirty--his
\par present age.  This was the second line of absentees.  The great estate of
\par Castra Regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five
\par generations--covering more than a hundred and twenty years.  It has been
\par well administered, however, and no tenant or other connected with it has
\par had anything of which to complain.  All the same, there has been much
\par natural anxiety to see the new owner, and we are all excited about the
\par event of his coming.  Even I am, though I own my own estate, which,
\par though adjacent, is quite apart from Castra Regis.--Here we are now in
\par new ground for you.  That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, and when
\par we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county, and you
\par will naturally want your eyes.  So we shall shortly have to keep our
\par minds on old Mercia.  However, you need not be disappointed.  My old
\par friend, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, who, like myself, is a free-holder near
\par Castra Regis--his estate, Doom Tower, is over the border of Derbyshire,
\par on the Peak--is coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome
\par Edgar Caswall.  He is just the sort of man you will like.  He is devoted
\par to history, and is President of the Mercian Archaeological Society.  He
\par knows more of our own part of the country, with its history and its
\par people, than anyone else.  I expect he will have arrived before us, and
\par we three can have a long chat after dinner.  He is also our local
\par geologist and natural historian.  So you and he will have many interests
\par in common.  Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak
\par and its caverns, and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times."
\par 
\par They spent the night at Cheltenham, and on the following morning resumed
\par their journey to Stafford.  Adam's eyes were in constant employment, and
\par it was not till Salton declared that they had now entered on the last
\par stage of their journey, that he referred to Sir Nathaniel's coming.
\par 
\par As the dusk was closing down, they drove on to Lesser Hill, Mr. Salton's
\par house.  It was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings.
\par Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill, not quite so high
\par as that which was covered by the Castle, on whose tower flew the flag,
\par and which was all ablaze with moving lights, manifestly used in the
\par preparations for the festivities on the morrow.  So Adam deferred his
\par curiosity till daylight.  His grand-uncle was met at the door by a fine
\par old man, who greeted him warmly.
\par 
\par "I came over early as you wished.  I suppose this is your grand-nephew--I
\par am glad to meet you, Mr. Adam Salton.  I am Nathaniel de Salis, and your
\par uncle is one of my oldest friends."
\par 
\par Adam, from the moment of their eyes meeting, felt as if they were already
\par friends.  The meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already
\par sounded in his ears.
\par 
\par The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met, made the imparting
\par of information easy.  Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of the world, who
\par had travelled much, and within a certain area studied deeply.  He was a
\par brilliant conversationalist, as was to be expected from a successful
\par diplomatist, even under unstimulating conditions.  But he had been
\par touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger man's evident
\par admiration and willingness to learn from him.  Accordingly the
\par conversation, which began on the most friendly basis, soon warmed to an
\par interest above proof, as the old man spoke of it next day to Richard
\par Salton.  He knew already that his old friend wanted his grand-nephew to
\par learn all he could of the subject in hand, and so had during his journey
\par from the Peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation.
\par Accordingly, Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he
\par wanted to know.  When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn,
\par leaving the three men at their wine, Sir Nathaniel began.
\par 
\par "I gather from your uncle--by the way, I suppose we had better speak of
\par you as uncle and nephew, instead of going into exact relationship?  In
\par fact, your uncle is so old and dear a friend, that, with your permission,
\par I shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as
\par Adam, as though you were his son."
\par 
\par "I should like," answered the young man, "nothing better!"
\par 
\par The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men, but, with the usual
\par avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves,
\par they instinctively returned to the previous question.  Sir Nathaniel took
\par the lead.
\par 
\par "I understand, Adam, that your uncle has posted you regarding the
\par relationships of the Caswall family?"
\par 
\par "Partly, sir; but I understood that I was to hear minuter details from
\par you--if you would be so good."
\par 
\par "I shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge goes.
\par Well, the first Caswall in our immediate record is an Edgar, head of the
\par family and owner of the estate, who came into his kingdom just about the
\par time that George III. did.  He had one son of about twenty-four.  There
\par was a violent quarrel between the two.  No one of this generation has any
\par idea of the cause; but, considering the family characteristics, we may
\par take it for granted that though it was deep and violent, it was on the
\par surface trivial.
\par 
\par "The result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a
\par reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was going.  He
\par never came back again.  A few years after, he died, without having in the
\par meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his father.  He married abroad
\par and left one son, who seems to have been brought up in ignorance of all
\par belonging to him.  The gulf between them appears to have been
\par unbridgable; for in time this son married and in turn had a son, but
\par neither joy nor sorrow brought the sundered together.  Under such
\par conditions no _rapprochement_ was to be looked for, and an utter
\par indifference, founded at best on ignorance, took the place of family
\par affection--even on community of interests.  It was only due to the
\par watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of this new heir was ever made
\par known.  He actually spent a few months in the ancestral home.
\par 
\par "After this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the estate.
\par As no other children have been born to any of the newer generations in
\par the intervening years, all hopes of heritage are now centred in the
\par grandson of this man.
\par 
\par "Now, it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing
\par characteristics of this race.  These were well preserved and unchanging;
\par one and all they are the same: cold, selfish, dominant, reckless of
\par consequences in pursuit of their own will.  It was not that they did not
\par keep faith, though that was a matter which gave them little concern, but
\par that they took care to think beforehand of what they should do in order
\par to gain their own ends.  If they should make a mistake, someone else
\par should bear the burthen of it.  This was so perpetually recurrent that it
\par seemed to be a part of a fixed policy.  It was no wonder that, whatever
\par changes took place, they were always ensured in their own possessions.
\par They were absolutely cold and hard by nature.  Not one of them--so far as
\par we have any knowledge--was ever known to be touched by the softer
\par sentiments, to swerve from his purpose, or hold his hand in obedience to
\par the dictates of his heart.  The pictures and effigies of them all show
\par their adherence to the early Roman type.  Their eyes were full; their
\par hair, of raven blackness, grew thick and close and curly.  Their figures
\par were massive and typical of strength.
\par 
\par "The thick black hair, growing low down on the neck, told of vast
\par physical strength and endurance.  But the most remarkable characteristic
\par is the eyes.  Black, piercing, almost unendurable, they seem to contain
\par in themselves a remarkable will power which there is no gainsaying.  It
\par is a power that is partly racial and partly individual: a power
\par impregnated with some mysterious quality, partly hypnotic, partly
\par mesmeric, which seems to take away from eyes that meet them all power of
\par resistance--nay, all power of wishing to resist.  With eyes like those,
\par set in that all-commanding face, one would need to be strong indeed to
\par think of resisting the inflexible will that lay behind.
\par 
\par "You may think, Adam, that all this is imagination on my part, especially
\par as I have never seen any of them.  So it is, but imagination based on
\par deep study.  I have made use of all I know or can surmise logically
\par regarding this strange race.  With such strange compelling qualities, is
\par it any wonder that there is abroad an idea that in the race there is some
\par demoniac possession, which tends to a more definite belief that certain
\par individuals have in the past sold themselves to the Devil?
\par 
\par "But I think we had better go to bed now.  We have a lot to get through
\par to-morrow, and I want you to have your brain clear, and all your
\par susceptibilities fresh.  Moreover, I want you to come with me for an
\par early walk, during which we may notice, whilst the matter is fresh in our
\par minds, the peculiar disposition of this place--not merely your
\par grand-uncle's estate, but the lie of the country around it.  There are
\par many things on which we may seek--and perhaps find--enlightenment.  The
\par more we know at the start, the more things which may come into our view
\par will develop themselves."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER III--DIANA'S GROVE
\par 
\par 
\par Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning, but when he
\par had dressed and gone downstairs; he found that, early as he was, Sir
\par Nathaniel was ahead of him.  The old gentleman was quite prepared for a
\par long walk, and they started at once.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, led the way to the east, down the hill.
\par When they had descended and risen again, they found themselves on the
\par eastern brink of a steep hill.  It was of lesser height than that on
\par which the Castle was situated; but it was so placed that it commanded the
\par various hills that crowned the ridge.  All along the ridge the rock
\par cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken in rough natural castellation.
\par The form of the ridge was a segment of a circle, with the higher points
\par inland to the west.  In the centre rose the Castle, on the highest point
\par of all.  Between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of
\par various sizes and heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early
\par morning light, looked like ruins.  These--whatever they were--were of
\par massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they were
\par not shaped naturally.  The fall of the ground was steep all along the
\par ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings
\par seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which ran many streams.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel stopped and looked around, as though to lose nothing of the
\par effect.  The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making all details
\par clear.  He pointed with a sweeping gesture, as though calling Adam's
\par attention to the extent of the view.  Having done so, he covered the
\par ground more slowly, as though inviting attention to detail.  Adam was a
\par willing and attentive pupil, and followed his motions exactly, missing--or
\par trying to miss--nothing.
\par 
\par "I have brought you here, Adam, because it seems to me that this is the
\par spot on which to begin our investigations.  You have now in front of you
\par almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  In fact, we see the
\par whole of it except that furthest part, which is covered by the Welsh
\par Marches and those parts which are hidden from where we stand by the high
\par ground of the immediate west.  We can see--theoretically--the whole of
\par the eastern bound of the kingdom, which ran south from the Humber to the
\par Wash.  I want you to bear in mind the trend of the ground, for some time,
\par sooner or later, we shall do well to have it in our mind's eye when we
\par are considering the ancient traditions and superstitions, and are trying
\par to find the _rationale_ of them.  Each legend, each superstition which we
\par receive, will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the
\par others.  And as all such have a local basis, we can come closer to the
\par truth--or the probability--by knowing the local conditions as we go
\par along.  It will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth as we
\par may have between us.  For instance, the building materials used in
\par various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding eyes.  The
\par very heights and shapes and materials of these hills--nay, even of the
\par wide plain that lies between us and the sea--have in themselves the
\par materials of enlightening books."
\par 
\par "For instance, sir?" said Adam, venturing a question.
\par 
\par "Well, look at those hills which surround the main one where the site for
\par the Castle was wisely chosen--on the highest ground.  Take the others.
\par There is something ostensible in each of them, and in all probability
\par something unseen and unproved, but to be imagined, also."
\par 
\par "For instance?" continued Adam.
\par 
\par "Let us take them _seriatim_.  That to the east, where the trees are,
\par lower down--that was once the location of a Roman temple, possibly
\par founded on a pre-existing Druidical one.  Its name implies the former,
\par and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter."
\par 
\par "Please explain."
\par 
\par "The old name translated means 'Diana's Grove.'  Then the next one higher
\par than it, but just beyond it, is called '_Mercy_'--in all probability a
\par corruption or familiarisation of the word _Mercia_, with a Roman pun
\par included.  We learn from early manuscripts that the place was called
\par _Vilula Misericordiae_.  It was originally a nunnery, founded by Queen
\par Bertha, but done away with by King Penda, the reactionary to Paganism
\par after St. Augustine.  Then comes your uncle's place--Lesser Hill.  Though
\par it is so close to the Castle, it is not connected with it.  It is a
\par freehold, and, so far as we know, of equal age.  It has always belonged
\par to your family."
\par 
\par "Then there only remains the Castle!"
\par 
\par "That is all; but its history contains the histories of all the others--in
\par fact, the whole history of early England."  Sir Nathaniel, seeing the
\par expectant look on Adam's face, went on:
\par 
\par "The history of the Castle has no beginning so far as we know.  The
\par furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as existing.
\par Some of these--guesses, let us call them--seem to show that there was
\par some sort of structure there when the Romans came, therefore it must have
\par been a place of importance in Druid times--if indeed that was the
\par beginning.  Naturally the Romans accepted it, as they did everything of
\par the kind that was, or might be, useful.  The change is shown or inferred
\par in the name Castra.  It was the highest protected ground, and so
\par naturally became the most important of their camps.  A study of the map
\par will show you that it must have been a most important centre.  It both
\par protected the advances already made to the north, and helped to dominate
\par the sea coast.  It sheltered the western marches, beyond which lay savage
\par Wales--and danger.  It provided a means of getting to the Severn, round
\par which lay the great Roman roads then coming into existence, and made
\par possible the great waterway to the heart of England--through the Severn
\par and its tributaries.  It brought the east and the west together by the
\par swiftest and easiest ways known to those times.  And, finally, it
\par provided means of descent on London and all the expanse of country
\par watered by the Thames.
\par 
\par "With such a centre, already known and organised, we can easily see that
\par each fresh wave of invasion--the Angles, the Saxons, the Danes, and the
\par Normans--found it a desirable possession and so ensured its upholding.  In
\par the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground.  But when the
\par victorious Romans brought with them the heavy solid fortifications
\par impregnable to the weapons of the time, its commanding position alone
\par ensured its adequate building and equipment.  Then it was that the
\par fortified camp of the Caesars developed into the castle of the king.  As
\par we are as yet ignorant of the names of the first kings of Mercia, no
\par historian has been able to guess which of them made it his ultimate
\par defence; and I suppose we shall never know now.  In process of time, as
\par the arts of war developed, it increased in size and strength, and
\par although recorded details are lacking, the history is written not merely
\par in the stone of its building, but is inferred in the changes of
\par structure.  Then the sweeping changes which followed the Norman Conquest
\par wiped out all lesser records than its own.  To-day we must accept it as
\par one of the earliest castles of the Conquest, probably not later than the
\par time of Henry I.  Roman and Norman were both wise in their retention of
\par places of approved strength or utility.  So it was that these surrounding
\par heights, already established and to a certain extent proved, were
\par retained.  Indeed, such characteristics as already pertained to them were
\par preserved, and to-day afford to us lessons regarding things which have
\par themselves long since passed away.
\par 
\par "So much for the fortified heights; but the hollows too have their own
\par story.  But how the time passes!  We must hurry home, or your uncle will
\par wonder what has become of us."
\par 
\par He started with long steps towards Lesser Hill, and Adam was soon
\par furtively running in order to keep up with him.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER IV--THE LADY ARABELLA MARCH
\par 
\par 
\par "Now, there is no hurry, but so soon as you are both ready we shall
\par start," Mr. Salton said when breakfast had begun.  "I want to take you
\par first to see a remarkable relic of Mercia, and then we'll go to Liverpool
\par through what is called 'The Great Vale of Cheshire.'  You may be
\par disappointed, but take care not to prepare your mind"--this to Adam--"for
\par anything stupendous or heroic.  You would not think the place a vale at
\par all, unless you were told so beforehand, and had confidence in the
\par veracity of the teller.  We should get to the Landing Stage in time to
\par meet the _West African_, and catch Mr. Caswall as he comes ashore.  We
\par want to do him honour--and, besides, it will be more pleasant to have the
\par introductions over before we go to his _fete_ at the Castle."
\par 
\par The carriage was ready, the same as had been used the previous day, but
\par there were different horses--magnificent animals, and keen for work.
\par Breakfast was soon over, and they shortly took their places.  The
\par postillions had their orders, and were quickly on their way at an
\par exhilarating pace.
\par 
\par Presently, in obedience to Mr. Salton's signal, the carriage drew up
\par opposite a great heap of stones by the wayside.
\par 
\par "Here, Adam," he said, "is something that you of all men should not pass
\par by unnoticed.  That heap of stones brings us at once to the dawn of the
\par Anglian kingdom.  It was begun more than a thousand years ago--in the
\par latter part of the seventh century--in memory of a murder.  Wulfere, King
\par of Mercia, nephew of Penda, here murdered his two sons for embracing
\par Christianity.  As was the custom of the time, each passer-by added a
\par stone to the memorial heap.  Penda represented heathen reaction after St.
\par Augustine's mission.  Sir Nathaniel can tell you as much as you want
\par about this, and put you, if you wish, on the track of such accurate
\par knowledge as there is."
\par 
\par Whilst they were looking at the heap of stones, they noticed that another
\par carriage had drawn up beside them, and the passenger--there was only
\par one--was regarding them curiously.  The carriage was an old heavy
\par travelling one, with arms blazoned on it gorgeously.  The men took off
\par their hats, as the occupant, a lady, addressed them.
\par 
\par "How do you do, Sir Nathaniel?  How do you do, Mr. Salton?  I hope you
\par have not met with any accident.  Look at me!"
\par 
\par As she spoke she pointed to where one of the heavy springs was broken
\par across, the broken metal showing bright.  Adam spoke up at once:
\par 
\par "Oh, that can soon be put right."
\par 
\par "Soon?  There is no one near who can mend a break like that."
\par 
\par "I can."
\par 
\par "You!"  She looked incredulously at the dapper young gentleman who spoke.
\par "You--why, it's a workman's job."
\par 
\par "All right, I am a workman--though that is not the only sort of work I
\par do.  I am an Australian, and, as we have to move about fast, we are all
\par trained to farriery and such mechanics as come into travel--I am quite at
\par your service."
\par 
\par "I hardly know how to thank you for your kindness, of which I gladly
\par avail myself.  I don't know what else I can do, as I wish to meet Mr.
\par Caswall of Castra Regis, who arrives home from Africa to-day.  It is a
\par notable home-coming; all the countryside want to do him honour."  She
\par looked at the old men and quickly made up her mind as to the identity of
\par the stranger.  "You must be Mr. Adam Salton of Lesser Hill.  I am Lady
\par Arabella March of Diana's Grove."  As she spoke she turned slightly to
\par Mr. Salton, who took the hint and made a formal introduction.
\par 
\par So soon as this was done, Adam took some tools from his uncle's carriage,
\par and at once began work on the broken spring.  He was an expert workman,
\par and the breach was soon made good.  Adam was gathering the tools which he
\par had been using--which, after the manner of all workmen, had been
\par scattered about--when he noticed that several black snakes had crawled
\par out from the heap of stones and were gathering round him.  This naturally
\par occupied his mind, and he was not thinking of anything else when he
\par noticed Lady Arabella, who had opened the door of the carriage, slip from
\par it with a quick gliding motion.  She was already among the snakes when he
\par called out to warn her.  But there seemed to be no need of warning.  The
\par snakes had turned and were wriggling back to the mound as quickly as they
\par could.  He laughed to himself behind his teeth as he whispered, "No need
\par to fear there.  They seem much more afraid of her than she of them."  All
\par the same he began to beat on the ground with a stick which was lying
\par close to him, with the instinct of one used to such vermin.  In an
\par instant he was alone beside the mound with Lady Arabella, who appeared
\par quite unconcerned at the incident.  Then he took a long look at her, and
\par her dress alone was sufficient to attract attention.  She was clad in
\par some kind of soft white stuff, which clung close to her form, showing to
\par the full every movement of her sinuous figure.  She wore a close-fitting
\par cap of some fine fur of dazzling white.  Coiled round her white throat
\par was a large necklace of emeralds, whose profusion of colour dazzled when
\par the sun shone on them.  Her voice was peculiar, very low and sweet, and
\par so soft that the dominant note was of sibilation.  Her hands, too, were
\par peculiar--long, flexible, white, with a strange movement as of waving
\par gently to and fro.
\par 
\par She appeared quite at ease, and, after thanking Adam, said that if any of
\par his uncle's party were going to Liverpool she would be most happy to join
\par forces.
\par 
\par "Whilst you are staying here, Mr. Salton, you must look on the grounds of
\par Diana's Grove as your own, so that you may come and go just as you do in
\par Lesser Hill.  There are some fine views, and not a few natural
\par curiosities which are sure to interest you, if you are a student of
\par natural history--specially of an earlier kind, when the world was
\par younger."
\par 
\par The heartiness with which she spoke, and the warmth of her words--not of
\par her manner, which was cold and distant--made him suspicious.  In the
\par meantime both his uncle and Sir Nathaniel had thanked her for the
\par invitation--of which, however, they said they were unable to avail
\par themselves.  Adam had a suspicion that, though she answered regretfully,
\par she was in reality relieved.  When he had got into the carriage with the
\par two old men, and they had driven off, he was not surprised when Sir
\par Nathaniel spoke.
\par 
\par "I could not but feel that she was glad to be rid of us.  She can play
\par her game better alone!"
\par 
\par "What is her game?" asked Adam unthinkingly.
\par 
\par "All the county knows it, my boy.  Caswall is a very rich man.  Her
\par husband was rich when she married him--or seemed to be.  When he
\par committed suicide, it was found that he had nothing left, and the estate
\par was mortgaged up to the hilt.  Her only hope is in a rich marriage.  I
\par suppose I need not draw any conclusion; you can do that as well as I
\par can."
\par 
\par Adam remained silent nearly all the time they were travelling through the
\par alleged Vale of Cheshire.  He thought much during that journey and came
\par to several conclusions, though his lips were unmoved.  One of these
\par conclusions was that he would be very careful about paying any attention
\par to Lady Arabella.  He was himself a rich man, how rich not even his uncle
\par had the least idea, and would have been surprised had he known.
\par 
\par The remainder of the journey was uneventful, and upon arrival at
\par Liverpool they went aboard the _West African_, which had just come to the
\par landing-stage.  There his uncle introduced himself to Mr. Caswall, and
\par followed this up by introducing Sir Nathaniel and then Adam.  The new-
\par comer received them graciously, and said what a pleasure it was to be
\par coming home after so long an absence of his family from their old seat.
\par Adam was pleased at the warmth of the reception; but he could not avoid a
\par feeling of repugnance at the man's face.  He was trying hard to overcome
\par this when a diversion was caused by the arrival of Lady Arabella.  The
\par diversion was welcome to all; the two Saltons and Sir Nathaniel were
\par shocked at Caswall's face--so hard, so ruthless, so selfish, so dominant.
\par "God help any," was the common thought, "who is under the domination of
\par such a man!"
\par 
\par Presently his African servant approached him, and at once their thoughts
\par changed to a larger toleration.  Caswall looked indeed a savage--but a
\par cultured savage.  In him were traces of the softening civilisation of
\par ages--of some of the higher instincts and education of man, no matter how
\par rudimentary these might be.  But the face of Oolanga, as his master
\par called him, was unreformed, unsoftened savage, and inherent in it were
\par all the hideous possibilities of a lost, devil-ridden child of the forest
\par and the swamp--the lowest of all created things that could be regarded as
\par in some form ostensibly human.  Lady Arabella and Oolanga arrived almost
\par simultaneously, and Adam was surprised to notice what effect their
\par appearance had on each other.  The woman seemed as if she would not--could
\par not--condescend to exhibit any concern or interest in such a creature.  On
\par the other hand, the negro's bearing was such as in itself to justify her
\par pride.  He treated her not merely as a slave treats his master, but as a
\par worshipper would treat a deity.  He knelt before her with his hands out-
\par stretched and his forehead in the dust.  So long as she remained he did
\par not move; it was only when she went over to Caswall that he relaxed his
\par attitude of devotion and stood by respectfully.
\par 
\par Adam spoke to his own man, Davenport, who was standing by, having arrived
\par with the bailiff of Lesser Hill, who had followed Mr. Salton in a pony
\par trap.  As he spoke, he pointed to an attentive ship's steward, and
\par presently the two men were conversing.
\par 
\par "I think we ought to be moving," Mr. Salton said to Adam.  "I have some
\par things to do in Liverpool, and I am sure that both Mr. Caswall and Lady
\par Arabella would like to get under weigh for Castra Regis."
\par 
\par "I too, sir, would like to do something," replied Adam.  "I want to find
\par out where Ross, the animal merchant, lives--I want to take a small animal
\par home with me, if you don't mind.  He is only a little thing, and will be
\par no trouble."
\par 
\par "Of course not, my boy.  What kind of animal is it that you want?"
\par 
\par "A mongoose."
\par 
\par "A mongoose!  What on earth do you want it for?"
\par 
\par "To kill snakes."
\par 
\par "Good!"  The old man remembered the mound of stones.  No explanation was
\par needed.
\par 
\par When Ross heard what was wanted, he asked:
\par 
\par "Do you want something special, or will an ordinary mongoose do?"
\par 
\par "Well, of course I want a good one.  But I see no need for anything
\par special.  It is for ordinary use."
\par 
\par "I can let you have a choice of ordinary ones.  I only asked, because I
\par have in stock a very special one which I got lately from Nepaul.  He has
\par a record of his own.  He killed a king cobra that had been seen in the
\par Rajah's garden.  But I don't suppose we have any snakes of the kind in
\par this cold climate--I daresay an ordinary one will do."
\par 
\par When Adam got back to the carriage, carefully carrying the box with the
\par mongoose, Sir Nathaniel said: "Hullo! what have you got there?"
\par 
\par "A mongoose."
\par 
\par "What for?"
\par 
\par "To kill snakes!"
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel laughed.
\par 
\par "I heard Lady Arabella's invitation to you to come to Diana's Grove."
\par 
\par "Well, what on earth has that got to do with it?"
\par 
\par "Nothing directly that I know of.  But we shall see."  Adam waited, and
\par the old man went on: "Have you by any chance heard the other name which
\par was given long ago to that place."
\par 
\par "No, sir."
\par 
\par "It was called--Look here, this subject wants a lot of talking over.
\par Suppose we wait till we are alone and have lots of time before us."
\par 
\par "All right, sir."  Adam was filled with curiosity, but he thought it
\par better not to hurry matters.  All would come in good time.  Then the
\par three men returned home, leaving Mr. Caswall to spend the night in
\par Liverpool.
\par 
\par The following day the Lesser Hill party set out for Castra Regis, and for
\par the time Adam thought no more of Diana's Grove or of what mysteries it
\par had contained--or might still contain.
\par 
\par The guests were crowding in, and special places were marked for important
\par people.  Adam, seeing so many persons of varied degree, looked round for
\par Lady Arabella, but could not locate her.  It was only when he saw the old-
\par fashioned travelling carriage approach and heard the sound of cheering
\par which went with it, that he realised that Edgar Caswall had arrived.
\par Then, on looking more closely, he saw that Lady Arabella, dressed as he
\par had seen her last, was seated beside him.  When the carriage drew up at
\par the great flight of steps, the host jumped down and gave her his hand.
\par 
\par It was evident to all that she was the chief guest at the festivities.  It
\par was not long before the seats on the dais were filled, while the tenants
\par and guests of lesser importance had occupied all the coigns of vantage
\par not reserved.  The order of the day had been carefully arranged by a
\par committee.  There were some speeches, happily neither many nor long; and
\par then festivities were suspended till the time for feasting arrived.  In
\par the interval Caswall walked among his guests, speaking to all in a
\par friendly manner and expressing a general welcome.  The other guests came
\par down from the dais and followed his example, so there was unceremonious
\par meeting and greeting between gentle and simple.
\par 
\par Adam Salton naturally followed with his eyes all that went on within
\par their scope, taking note of all who seemed to afford any interest.  He
\par was young and a man and a stranger from a far distance; so on all these
\par accounts he naturally took stock rather of the women than of the men, and
\par of these, those who were young and attractive.  There were lots of pretty
\par girls among the crowd, and Adam, who was a handsome young man and well
\par set up, got his full share of admiring glances.  These did not concern
\par him much, and he remained unmoved until there came along a group of
\par three, by their dress and bearing, of the farmer class.  One was a sturdy
\par old man; the other two were good-looking girls, one of a little over
\par twenty, the other not quite so old.  So soon as Adam's eyes met those of
\par the younger girl, who stood nearest to him, some sort of electricity
\par flashed--that divine spark which begins by recognition, and ends in
\par obedience.  Men call it "Love."
\par 
\par Both his companions noticed how much Adam was taken by the pretty girl,
\par and spoke of her to him in a way which made his heart warm to them.
\par 
\par "Did you notice that party that passed?  The old man is Michael Watford,
\par one of the tenants of Mr. Caswall.  He occupies Mercy Farm, which Sir
\par Nathaniel pointed out to you to-day.  The girls are his grand-daughters,
\par the elder, Lilla, being the only child of his elder son, who died when
\par she was less than a year old.  His wife died on the same day.  She is a
\par good girl--as good as she is pretty.  The other is her first cousin, the
\par daughter of Watford's second son.  He went for a soldier when he was just
\par over twenty, and was drafted abroad.  He was not a good correspondent,
\par though he was a good enough son.  A few letters came, and then his father
\par heard from the colonel of his regiment that he had been killed by dacoits
\par in Burmah.  He heard from the same source that his boy had been married
\par to a Burmese, and that there was a daughter only a year old.  Watford had
\par the child brought home, and she grew up beside Lilla.  The only thing
\par that they heard of her birth was that her name was Mimi.  The two
\par children adored each other, and do to this day.  Strange how different
\par they are!  Lilla all fair, like the old Saxon stock from which she is
\par sprung; Mimi showing a trace of her mother's race.  Lilla is as gentle as
\par a dove, but Mimi's black eyes can glow whenever she is upset.  The only
\par thing that upsets her is when anything happens to injure or threaten or
\par annoy Lilla.  Then her eyes glow as do the eyes of a bird when her young
\par are menaced."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER V--THE WHITE WORM
\par 
\par 
\par Mr. Salton introduced Adam to Mr. Watford and his grand-daughters, and
\par they all moved on together.  Of course neighbours in the position of the
\par Watfords knew all about Adam Salton, his relationship, circumstances, and
\par prospects.  So it would have been strange indeed if both girls did not
\par dream of possibilities of the future.  In agricultural England, eligible
\par men of any class are rare.  This particular man was specially eligible,
\par for he did not belong to a class in which barriers of caste were strong.
\par So when it began to be noticed that he walked beside Mimi Watford and
\par seemed to desire her society, all their friends endeavoured to give the
\par promising affair a helping hand.  When the gongs sounded for the banquet,
\par he went with her into the tent where her grandfather had seats.  Mr.
\par Salton and Sir Nathaniel noticed that the young man did not come to claim
\par his appointed place at the dais table; but they understood and made no
\par remark, or indeed did not seem to notice his absence.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella sat as before at Edgar Caswall's right hand.  She was
\par certainly a striking and unusual woman, and to all it seemed fitting from
\par her rank and personal qualities that she should be the chosen partner of
\par the heir on his first appearance.  Of course nothing was said openly by
\par those of her own class who were present; but words were not necessary
\par when so much could be expressed by nods and smiles.  It seemed to be an
\par accepted thing that at last there was to be a mistress of Castra Regis,
\par and that she was present amongst them.  There were not lacking some who,
\par whilst admitting all her charm and beauty, placed her in the second rank,
\par Lilla Watford being marked as first.  There was sufficient divergence of
\par type, as well as of individual beauty, to allow of fair comment; Lady
\par Arabella represented the aristocratic type, and Lilla that of the
\par commonalty.
\par 
\par When the dusk began to thicken, Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel walked
\par home--the trap had been sent away early in the day--leaving Adam to
\par follow in his own time.  He came in earlier than was expected, and seemed
\par upset about something.  Neither of the elders made any comment.  They all
\par lit cigarettes, and, as dinner-time was close at hand, went to their
\par rooms to get ready.
\par 
\par Adam had evidently been thinking in the interval.  He joined the others
\par in the drawing-room, looking ruffled and impatient--a condition of things
\par seen for the first time.  The others, with the patience--or the
\par experience--of age, trusted to time to unfold and explain things.  They
\par had not long to wait.  After sitting down and standing up several times,
\par Adam suddenly burst out.
\par 
\par "That fellow seems to think he owns the earth.  Can't he let people
\par alone!  He seems to think that he has only to throw his handkerchief to
\par any woman, and be her master."
\par 
\par This outburst was in itself enlightening.  Only thwarted affection in
\par some guise could produce this feeling in an amiable young man.  Sir
\par Nathaniel, as an old diplomatist, had a way of understanding, as if by
\par foreknowledge, the true inwardness of things, and asked suddenly, but in
\par a matter-of-fact, indifferent voice:
\par 
\par "Was he after Lilla?"
\par 
\par "Yes, and the fellow didn't lose any time either.  Almost as soon as they
\par met, he began to butter her up, and tell her how beautiful she was.  Why,
\par before he left her side, he had asked himself to tea to-morrow at Mercy
\par Farm.  Stupid ass!  He might see that the girl isn't his sort!  I never
\par saw anything like it.  It was just like a hawk and a pigeon."
\par 
\par As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel turned and looked at Mr. Salton--a keen look
\par which implied a full understanding.
\par 
\par "Tell us all about it, Adam.  There are still a few minutes before
\par dinner, and we shall all have better appetites when we have come to some
\par conclusion on this matter."
\par 
\par "There is nothing to tell, sir; that is the worst of it.  I am bound to
\par say that there was not a word said that a human being could object to.  He
\par was very civil, and all that was proper--just what a landlord might be to
\par a tenant's daughter . . . Yet--yet--well, I don't know how it was, but it
\par made my blood boil."
\par 
\par "How did the hawk and the pigeon come in?"  Sir Nathaniel's voice was
\par soft and soothing, nothing of contradiction or overdone curiosity in it--a
\par tone eminently suited to win confidence.
\par 
\par "I can hardly explain.  I can only say that he looked like a hawk and she
\par like a dove--and, now that I think of it, that is what they each did look
\par like; and do look like in their normal condition."
\par 
\par "That is so!" came the soft voice of Sir Nathaniel.
\par 
\par Adam went on:
\par 
\par "Perhaps that early Roman look of his set me off.  But I wanted to
\par protect her; she seemed in danger."
\par 
\par "She seems in danger, in a way, from all you young men.  I couldn't help
\par noticing the way that even you looked--as if you wished to absorb her!"
\par 
\par "I hope both you young men will keep your heads cool," put in Mr. Salton.
\par "You know, Adam, it won't do to have any quarrel between you, especially
\par so soon after his home-coming and your arrival here.  We must think of
\par the feelings and happiness of our neighbours; mustn't we?"
\par 
\par "I hope so, sir.  I assure you that, whatever may happen, or even
\par threaten, I shall obey your wishes in this as in all things."
\par 
\par "Hush!" whispered Sir Nathaniel, who heard the servants in the passage
\par bringing dinner.
\par 
\par After dinner, over the walnuts and the wine, Sir Nathaniel returned to
\par the subject of the local legends.
\par 
\par "It will perhaps be a less dangerous topic for us to discuss than more
\par recent ones."
\par 
\par "All right, sir," said Adam heartily.  "I think you may depend on me now
\par with regard to any topic.  I can even discuss Mr. Caswall.  Indeed, I may
\par meet him to-morrow.  He is going, as I said, to call at Mercy Farm at
\par three o'clock--but I have an appointment at two."
\par 
\par "I notice," said Mr. Salton, "that you do not lose any time."
\par 
\par The two old men once more looked at each other steadily.  Then, lest the
\par mood of his listener should change with delay, Sir Nathaniel began at
\par once:
\par 
\par "I don't propose to tell you all the legends of Mercia, or even to make a
\par selection of them.  It will be better, I think, for our purpose if we
\par consider a few facts--recorded or unrecorded--about this neighbourhood.  I
\par think we might begin with Diana's Grove.  It has roots in the different
\par epochs of our history, and each has its special crop of legend.  The
\par Druid and the Roman are too far off for matters of detail; but it seems
\par to me the Saxon and the Angles are near enough to yield material for
\par legendary lore.  We find that this particular place had another name
\par besides Diana's Grove.  This was manifestly of Roman origin, or of
\par Grecian accepted as Roman.  The other is more pregnant of adventure and
\par romance than the Roman name.  In Mercian tongue it was 'The Lair of the
\par White Worm.'  This needs a word of explanation at the beginning.
\par 
\par "In the dawn of the language, the word 'worm' had a somewhat different
\par meaning from that in use to-day.  It was an adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon
\par 'wyrm,' meaning a dragon or snake; or from the Gothic 'waurms,' a
\par serpent; or the Icelandic 'ormur,' or the German 'wurm.'  We gather that
\par it conveyed originally an idea of size and power, not as now in the
\par diminutive of both these meanings.  Here legendary history helps us.  We
\par have the well-known legend of the 'Worm Well' of Lambton Castle, and that
\par of the 'Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh' near Bamborough.  In both these
\par legends the 'worm' was a monster of vast size and power--a veritable
\par dragon or serpent, such as legend attributes to vast fens or quags where
\par there was illimitable room for expansion.  A glance at a geological map
\par will show that whatever truth there may have been of the actuality of
\par such monsters in the early geologic periods, at least there was plenty of
\par possibility.  In England there were originally vast plains where the
\par plentiful supply of water could gather.  The streams were deep and slow,
\par and there were holes of abysmal depth, where any kind and size of
\par antediluvian monster could find a habitat.  In places, which now we can
\par see from our windows, were mud-holes a hundred or more feet deep.  Who
\par can tell us when the age of the monsters which flourished in slime came
\par to an end?  There must have been places and conditions which made for
\par greater longevity, greater size, greater strength than was usual.  Such
\par over-lappings may have come down even to our earlier centuries.  Nay, are
\par there not now creatures of a vastness of bulk regarded by the generality
\par of men as impossible?  Even in our own day there are seen the traces of
\par animals, if not the animals themselves, of stupendous size--veritable
\par survivals from earlier ages, preserved by some special qualities in their
\par habitats.  I remember meeting a distinguished man in India, who had the
\par reputation of being a great shikaree, who told me that the greatest
\par temptation he had ever had in his life was to shoot a giant snake which
\par he had come across in the Terai of Upper India.  He was on a
\par tiger-shooting expedition, and as his elephant was crossing a nullah, it
\par squealed.  He looked down from his howdah and saw that the elephant had
\par stepped across the body of a snake which was dragging itself through the
\par jungle.  'So far as I could see,' he said, 'it must have been eighty or
\par one hundred feet in length.  Fully forty or fifty feet was on each side
\par of the track, and though the weight which it dragged had thinned it, it
\par was as thick round as a man's body.  I suppose you know that when you are
\par after tiger, it is a point of honour not to shoot at anything else, as
\par life may depend on it.  I could easily have spined this monster, but I
\par felt that I must not--so, with regret, I had to let it go.'
\par 
\par "Just imagine such a monster anywhere in this country, and at once we
\par could get a sort of idea of the 'worms,' which possibly did frequent the
\par great morasses which spread round the mouths of many of the great
\par European rivers."
\par 
\par "I haven't the least doubt, sir, that there may have been such monsters
\par as you have spoken of still existing at a much later period than is
\par generally accepted," replied Adam.  "Also, if there were such things,
\par that this was the very place for them.  I have tried to think over the
\par matter since you pointed out the configuration of the ground.  But it
\par seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere.  Are there not mechanical
\par difficulties?"
\par 
\par "In what way?"
\par 
\par "Well, our antique monster must have been mighty heavy, and the distances
\par he had to travel were long and the ways difficult.  From where we are now
\par sitting down to the level of the mud-holes is a distance of several
\par hundred feet--I am leaving out of consideration altogether any lateral
\par distance.  Is it possible that there was a way by which a monster could
\par travel up and down, and yet no chance recorder have ever seen him?  Of
\par course we have the legends; but is not some more exact evidence necessary
\par in a scientific investigation?"
\par 
\par "My dear Adam, all you say is perfectly right, and, were we starting on
\par such an investigation, we could not do better than follow your reasoning.
\par But, my dear boy, you must remember that all this took place thousands of
\par years ago.  You must remember, too, that all records of the kind that
\par would help us are lacking.  Also, that the places to be considered were
\par desert, so far as human habitation or population are considered.  In the
\par vast desolation of such a place as complied with the necessary
\par conditions, there must have been such profusion of natural growth as
\par would bar the progress of men formed as we are.  The lair of such a
\par monster would not have been disturbed for hundreds--or thousands--of
\par years.  Moreover, these creatures must have occupied places quite
\par inaccessible to man.  A snake who could make himself comfortable in a
\par quagmire, a hundred feet deep, would be protected on the outskirts by
\par such stupendous morasses as now no longer exist, or which, if they exist
\par anywhere at all, can be on very few places on the earth's surface.  Far
\par be it from me to say that in more elemental times such things could not
\par have been.  The condition belongs to the geologic age--the great birth
\par and growth of the world, when natural forces ran riot, when the struggle
\par for existence was so savage that no vitality which was not founded in a
\par gigantic form could have even a possibility of survival.  That such a
\par time existed, we have evidences in geology, but there only; we can never
\par expect proofs such as this age demands.  We can only imagine or surmise
\par such things--or such conditions and such forces as overcame them."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VI--HAWK AND PIGEON
\par 
\par 
\par At breakfast-time next morning Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton were seated
\par when Adam came hurriedly into the room.
\par 
\par "Any news?" asked his uncle mechanically.
\par 
\par "Four."
\par 
\par "Four what?" asked Sir Nathaniel.
\par 
\par "Snakes," said Adam, helping himself to a grilled kidney.
\par 
\par "Four snakes.  I don't understand."
\par 
\par "Mongoose," said Adam, and then added explanatorily: "I was out with the
\par mongoose just after three."
\par 
\par "Four snakes in one morning!  Why, I didn't know there were so many on
\par the Brow"--the local name for the western cliff.  "I hope that wasn't the
\par consequence of our talk of last night?"
\par 
\par "It was, sir.  But not directly."
\par 
\par "But, God bless my soul, you didn't expect to get a snake like the
\par Lambton worm, did you?  Why, a mongoose, to tackle a monster like that--if
\par there were one--would have to be bigger than a haystack."
\par 
\par "These were ordinary snakes, about as big as a walking-stick."
\par 
\par "Well, it's pleasant to be rid of them, big or little.  That is a good
\par mongoose, I am sure; he'll clear out all such vermin round here," said
\par Mr. Salton.
\par 
\par Adam went quietly on with his breakfast.  Killing a few snakes in a
\par morning was no new experience to him.  He left the room the moment
\par breakfast was finished and went to the study that his uncle had arranged
\par for him.  Both Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton took it that he wanted to be
\par by himself, so as to avoid any questioning or talk of the visit that he
\par was to make that afternoon.  They saw nothing further of him till about
\par half-an-hour before dinner-time.  Then he came quietly into the smoking-
\par room, where Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel were sitting together, ready
\par dressed.
\par 
\par "I suppose there is no use waiting.  We had better get it over at once,"
\par remarked Adam.
\par 
\par His uncle, thinking to make things easier for him, said: "Get what over?"
\par 
\par There was a sign of shyness about him at this.  He stammered a little at
\par first, but his voice became more even as he went on.
\par 
\par "My visit to Mercy Farm."
\par 
\par Mr. Salton waited eagerly.  The old diplomatist simply smiled.
\par 
\par "I suppose you both know that I was much interested yesterday in the
\par Watfords?"  There was no denial or fending off the question.  Both the
\par old men smiled acquiescence.  Adam went on: "I meant you to see it--both
\par of you.  You, uncle, because you are my uncle and the nearest of my own
\par kin, and, moreover, you couldn't have been more kind to me or made me
\par more welcome if you had been my own father."  Mr. Salton said nothing.  He
\par simply held out his hand, and the other took it and held it for a few
\par seconds.  "And you, sir, because you have shown me something of the same
\par affection which in my wildest dreams of home I had no right to expect."
\par He stopped for an instant, much moved.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel answered softly, laying his hand on the youth's shoulder.
\par 
\par "You are right, my boy; quite right.  That is the proper way to look at
\par it.  And I may tell you that we old men, who have no children of our own,
\par feel our hearts growing warm when we hear words like those."
\par 
\par Then Adam hurried on, speaking with a rush, as if he wanted to come to
\par the crucial point.
\par 
\par "Mr. Watford had not come in, but Lilla and Mimi were at home, and they
\par made me feel very welcome.  They have all a great regard for my uncle.  I
\par am glad of that any way, for I like them all--much.  We were having tea,
\par when Mr. Caswall came to the door, attended by the negro.  Lilla opened
\par the door herself.  The window of the living-room at the farm is a large
\par one, and from within you cannot help seeing anyone coming.  Mr. Caswall
\par said he had ventured to call, as he wished to make the acquaintance of
\par all his tenants, in a less formal way, and more individually, than had
\par been possible to him on the previous day.  The girls made him
\par welcome--they are very sweet girls those, sir; someone will be very happy
\par some day there--with either of them."
\par 
\par "And that man may be you, Adam," said Mr. Salton heartily.
\par 
\par A sad look came over the young man's eyes, and the fire his uncle had
\par seen there died out.  Likewise the timbre left his voice, making it sound
\par lonely.
\par 
\par "Such might crown my life.  But that happiness, I fear, is not for me--or
\par not without pain and loss and woe."
\par 
\par "Well, it's early days yet!" cried Sir Nathaniel heartily.
\par 
\par The young man turned on him his eyes, which had now grown excessively
\par sad.
\par 
\par "Yesterday--a few hours ago--that remark would have given me new hope--new
\par courage; but since then I have learned too much."
\par 
\par The old man, skilled in the human heart, did not attempt to argue in such
\par a matter.
\par 
\par "Too early to give in, my boy."
\par 
\par "I am not of a giving-in kind," replied the young man earnestly.  "But,
\par after all, it is wise to realise a truth.  And when a man, though he is
\par young, feels as I do--as I have felt ever since yesterday, when I first
\par saw Mimi's eyes--his heart jumps.  He does not need to learn things.  He
\par knows."
\par 
\par There was silence in the room, during which the twilight stole on
\par imperceptibly.  It was Adam who again broke the silence.
\par 
\par "Do you know, uncle, if we have any second sight in our family?"
\par 
\par "No, not that I ever heard about.  Why?"
\par 
\par "Because," he answered slowly, "I have a conviction which seems to answer
\par all the conditions of second sight."
\par 
\par "And then?" asked the old man, much perturbed.
\par 
\par "And then the usual inevitable.  What in the Hebrides and other places,
\par where the Sight is a cult--a belief--is called 'the doom'--the court from
\par which there is no appeal.  I have often heard of second sight--we have
\par many western Scots in Australia; but I have realised more of its true
\par inwardness in an instant of this afternoon than I did in the whole of my
\par life previously--a granite wall stretching up to the very heavens, so
\par high and so dark that the eye of God Himself cannot see beyond.  Well, if
\par the Doom must come, it must.  That is all."
\par 
\par The voice of Sir Nathaniel broke in, smooth and sweet and grave.
\par 
\par "Can there not be a fight for it?  There can for most things."
\par 
\par "For most things, yes, but for the Doom, no.  What a man can do I shall
\par do.  There will be--must be--a fight.  When and where and how I know not,
\par but a fight there will be.  But, after all, what is a man in such a
\par case?"
\par 
\par "Adam, there are three of us."  Salton looked at his old friend as he
\par spoke, and that old friend's eyes blazed.
\par 
\par "Ay, three of us," he said, and his voice rang.
\par 
\par There was again a pause, and Sir Nathaniel endeavoured to get back to
\par less emotional and more neutral ground.
\par 
\par "Tell us of the rest of the meeting.  Remember we are all pledged to
\par this.  It is a fight _a l'outrance_, and we can afford to throw away or
\par forgo no chance."
\par 
\par "We shall throw away or lose nothing that we can help.  We fight to win,
\par and the stake is a life--perhaps more than one--we shall see."  Then he
\par went on in a conversational tone, such as he had used when he spoke of
\par the coming to the farm of Edgar Caswall: "When Mr. Caswall came in, the
\par negro went a short distance away and there remained.  It gave me the idea
\par that he expected to be called, and intended to remain in sight, or within
\par hail.  Then Mimi got another cup and made fresh tea, and we all went on
\par together."
\par 
\par "Was there anything uncommon--were you all quite friendly?" asked Sir
\par Nathaniel quietly.
\par 
\par "Quite friendly.  There was nothing that I could notice out of the
\par common--except," he went on, with a slight hardening of the voice,
\par "except that he kept his eyes fixed on Lilla, in a way which was quite
\par intolerable to any man who might hold her dear."
\par 
\par "Now, in what way did he look?" asked Sir Nathaniel.
\par 
\par "There was nothing in itself offensive; but no one could help noticing
\par it."
\par 
\par "You did.  Miss Watford herself, who was the victim, and Mr. Caswall, who
\par was the offender, are out of range as witnesses.  Was there anyone else
\par who noticed?"
\par 
\par "Mimi did.  Her face flamed with anger as she saw the look."
\par 
\par "What kind of look was it?  Over-ardent or too admiring, or what?  Was it
\par the look of a lover, or one who fain would be?  You understand?"
\par 
\par "Yes, sir, I quite understand.  Anything of that sort I should of course
\par notice.  It would be part of my preparation for keeping my
\par self-control--to which I am pledged."
\par 
\par "If it were not amatory, was it threatening?  Where was the offence?"
\par 
\par Adam smiled kindly at the old man.
\par 
\par "It was not amatory.  Even if it was, such was to be expected.  I should
\par be the last man in the world to object, since I am myself an offender in
\par that respect.  Moreover, not only have I been taught to fight fair, but
\par by nature I believe I am just.  I would be as tolerant of and as liberal
\par to a rival as I should expect him to be to me.  No, the look I mean was
\par nothing of that kind.  And so long as it did not lack proper respect, I
\par should not of my own part condescend to notice it.  Did you ever study
\par the eyes of a hound?"
\par 
\par "At rest?"
\par 
\par "No, when he is following his instincts!  Or, better still," Adam went
\par on, "the eyes of a bird of prey when he is following his instincts.  Not
\par when he is swooping, but merely when he is watching his quarry?"
\par 
\par "No," said Sir Nathaniel, "I don't know that I ever did.  Why, may I
\par ask?"
\par 
\par "That was the look.  Certainly not amatory or anything of that kind--yet
\par it was, it struck me, more dangerous, if not so deadly as an actual
\par threatening."
\par 
\par Again there was a silence, which Sir Nathaniel broke as he stood up:
\par 
\par "I think it would be well if we all thought over this by ourselves.  Then
\par we can renew the subject."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VII--OOLANGA
\par 
\par 
\par Mr. Salton had an appointment for six o'clock at Liverpool.  When he had
\par driven off, Sir Nathaniel took Adam by the arm.
\par 
\par "May I come with you for a while to your study?  I want to speak to you
\par privately without your uncle knowing about it, or even what the subject
\par is.  You don't mind, do you?  It is not idle curiosity.  No, no.  It is
\par on the subject to which we are all committed."
\par 
\par "Is it necessary to keep my uncle in the dark about it?  He might be
\par offended."
\par 
\par "It is not necessary; but it is advisable.  It is for his sake that I
\par asked.  My friend is an old man, and it might concern him unduly--even
\par alarm him.  I promise you there shall be nothing that could cause him
\par anxiety in our silence, or at which he could take umbrage."
\par 
\par "Go on, sir!" said Adam simply.
\par 
\par "You see, your uncle is now an old man.  I know it, for we were boys
\par together.  He has led an uneventful and somewhat self-contained life, so
\par that any such condition of things as has now arisen is apt to perplex him
\par from its very strangeness.  In fact, any new matter is trying to old
\par people.  It has its own disturbances and its own anxieties, and neither
\par of these things are good for lives that should be restful.  Your uncle is
\par a strong man, with a very happy and placid nature.  Given health and
\par ordinary conditions of life, there is no reason why he should not live to
\par be a hundred.  You and I, therefore, who both love him, though in
\par different ways, should make it our business to protect him from all
\par disturbing influences.  I am sure you will agree with me that any labour
\par to this end would be well spent.  All right, my boy!  I see your answer
\par in your eyes; so we need say no more of that.  And now," here his voice
\par changed, "tell me all that took place at that interview.  There are
\par strange things in front of us--how strange we cannot at present even
\par guess.  Doubtless some of the difficult things to understand which lie
\par behind the veil will in time be shown to us to see and to understand.  In
\par the meantime, all we can do is to work patiently, fearlessly, and
\par unselfishly, to an end that we think is right.  You had got so far as
\par where Lilla opened the door to Mr. Caswall and the negro.  You also
\par observed that Mimi was disturbed in her mind at the way Mr. Caswall
\par looked at her cousin."
\par 
\par "Certainly--though 'disturbed' is a poor way of expressing her
\par objection."
\par 
\par "Can you remember well enough to describe Caswall's eyes, and how Lilla
\par looked, and what Mimi said and did?  Also Oolanga, Caswall's West African
\par servant."
\par 
\par "I'll do what I can, sir.  All the time Mr. Caswall was staring, he kept
\par his eyes fixed and motionless--but not as if he was in a trance.  His
\par forehead was wrinkled up, as it is when one is trying to see through or
\par into something.  At the best of times his face has not a gentle
\par expression; but when it was screwed up like that it was almost
\par diabolical.  It frightened poor Lilla so that she trembled, and after a
\par bit got so pale that I thought she had fainted.  However, she held up and
\par tried to stare back, but in a feeble kind of way.  Then Mimi came close
\par and held her hand.  That braced her up, and--still, never ceasing her
\par return stare--she got colour again and seemed more like herself."
\par 
\par "Did he stare too?"
\par 
\par "More than ever.  The weaker Lilla seemed, the stronger he became, just
\par as if he were feeding on her strength.  All at once she turned round,
\par threw up her hands, and fell down in a faint.  I could not see what else
\par happened just then, for Mimi had thrown herself on her knees beside her
\par and hid her from me.  Then there was something like a black shadow
\par between us, and there was the nigger, looking more like a malignant devil
\par than ever.  I am not usually a patient man, and the sight of that ugly
\par devil is enough to make one's blood boil.  When he saw my face, he seemed
\par to realise danger--immediate danger--and slunk out of the room as
\par noiselessly as if he had been blown out.  I learned one thing, however--he
\par is an enemy, if ever a man had one."
\par 
\par "That still leaves us three to two!" put in Sir Nathaniel.
\par 
\par "Then Caswall slunk out, much as the nigger had done.  When he had gone,
\par Lilla recovered at once."
\par 
\par "Now," said Sir Nathaniel, anxious to restore peace, "have you found out
\par anything yet regarding the negro?  I am anxious to be posted regarding
\par him.  I fear there will be, or may be, grave trouble with him."
\par 
\par "Yes, sir, I've heard a good deal about him--of course it is not
\par official; but hearsay must guide us at first.  You know my man
\par Davenport--private secretary, confidential man of business, and general
\par factotum.  He is devoted to me, and has my full confidence.  I asked him
\par to stay on board the _West African_ and have a good look round, and find
\par out what he could about Mr. Caswall.  Naturally, he was struck with the
\par aboriginal savage.  He found one of the ship's stewards, who had been on
\par the regular voyages to South Africa.  He knew Oolanga and had made a
\par study of him.  He is a man who gets on well with niggers, and they open
\par their hearts to him.  It seems that this Oolanga is quite a great person
\par in the nigger world of the African West Coast.  He has the two things
\par which men of his own colour respect: he can make them afraid, and he is
\par lavish with money.  I don't know whose money--but that does not matter.
\par They are always ready to trumpet his greatness.  Evil greatness it is--but
\par neither does that matter.  Briefly, this is his history.  He was
\par originally a witch-finder--about as low an occupation as exists amongst
\par aboriginal savages.  Then he got up in the world and became an Obi-man,
\par which gives an opportunity to wealth _via_ blackmail.  Finally, he
\par reached the highest honour in hellish service.  He became a user of
\par Voodoo, which seems to be a service of the utmost baseness and cruelty.  I
\par was told some of his deeds of cruelty, which are simply sickening.  They
\par made me long for an opportunity of helping to drive him back to hell.  You
\par might think to look at him that you could measure in some way the extent
\par of his vileness; but it would be a vain hope.  Monsters such as he is
\par belong to an earlier and more rudimentary stage of barbarism.  He is in
\par his way a clever fellow--for a nigger; but is none the less dangerous or
\par the less hateful for that.  The men in the ship told me that he was a
\par collector: some of them had seen his collections.  Such collections!  All
\par that was potent for evil in bird or beast, or even in fish.  Beaks that
\par could break and rend and tear--all the birds represented were of a
\par predatory kind.  Even the fishes are those which are born to destroy, to
\par wound, to torture.  The collection, I assure you, was an object lesson in
\par human malignity.  This being has enough evil in his face to frighten even
\par a strong man.  It is little wonder that the sight of it put that poor
\par girl into a dead faint!"
\par 
\par Nothing more could be done at the moment, so they separated.
\par 
\par Adam was up in the early morning and took a smart walk round the Brow.  As
\par he was passing Diana's Grove, he looked in on the short avenue of trees,
\par and noticed the snakes killed on the previous morning by the mongoose.
\par They all lay in a row, straight and rigid, as if they had been placed by
\par hands.  Their skins seemed damp and sticky, and they were covered all
\par over with ants and other insects.  They looked loathsome, so after a
\par glance, he passed on.
\par 
\par A little later, when his steps took him, naturally enough, past the
\par entrance to Mercy Farm, he was passed by the negro, moving quickly under
\par the trees wherever there was shadow.  Laid across one extended arm,
\par looking like dirty towels across a rail, he had the horrid-looking
\par snakes.  He did not seem to see Adam.  No one was to be seen at Mercy
\par except a few workmen in the farmyard, so, after waiting on the chance of
\par seeing Mimi, Adam began to go slowly home.
\par 
\par Once more he was passed on the way.  This time it was by Lady Arabella,
\par walking hurriedly and so furiously angry that she did not recognise him,
\par even to the extent of acknowledging his bow.
\par 
\par When Adam got back to Lesser Hill, he went to the coach-house where the
\par box with the mongoose was kept, and took it with him, intending to finish
\par at the Mound of Stone what he had begun the previous morning with regard
\par to the extermination.  He found that the snakes were even more easily
\par attacked than on the previous day; no less than six were killed in the
\par first half-hour.  As no more appeared, he took it for granted that the
\par morning's work was over, and went towards home.  The mongoose had by this
\par time become accustomed to him, and was willing to let himself be handled
\par freely.  Adam lifted him up and put him on his shoulder and walked on.
\par Presently he saw a lady advancing towards him, and recognised Lady
\par Arabella.
\par 
\par Hitherto the mongoose had been quiet, like a playful affectionate kitten;
\par but when the two got close, Adam was horrified to see the mongoose, in a
\par state of the wildest fury, with every hair standing on end, jump from his
\par shoulder and run towards Lady Arabella.  It looked so furious and so
\par intent on attack that he called a warning.
\par 
\par "Look out--look out!  The animal is furious and means to attack."
\par 
\par Lady Arabella looked more than ever disdainful and was passing on; the
\par mongoose jumped at her in a furious attack.  Adam rushed forward with his
\par stick, the only weapon he had.  But just as he got within striking
\par distance, the lady drew out a revolver and shot the animal, breaking his
\par backbone.  Not satisfied with this, she poured shot after shot into him
\par till the magazine was exhausted.  There was no coolness or hauteur about
\par her now; she seemed more furious even than the animal, her face
\par transformed with hate, and as determined to kill as he had appeared to
\par be.  Adam, not knowing exactly what to do, lifted his hat in apology and
\par hurried on to Lesser Hill.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VIII--SURVIVALS
\par 
\par 
\par At breakfast Sir Nathaniel noticed that Adam was put out about something,
\par but he said nothing.  The lesson of silence is better remembered in age
\par than in youth.  When they were both in the study, where Sir Nathaniel
\par followed him, Adam at once began to tell his companion of what had
\par happened.  Sir Nathaniel looked graver and graver as the narration
\par proceeded, and when Adam had stopped he remained silent for several
\par minutes, before speaking.
\par 
\par "This is very grave.  I have not formed any opinion yet; but it seems to
\par me at first impression that this is worse than anything I had expected."
\par 
\par "Why, sir?" said Adam.  "Is the killing of a mongoose--no matter by
\par whom--so serious a thing as all that?"
\par 
\par His companion smoked on quietly for quite another few minutes before he
\par spoke.
\par 
\par "When I have properly thought it over I may moderate my opinion, but in
\par the meantime it seems to me that there is something dreadful behind all
\par this--something that may affect all our lives--that may mean the issue of
\par life or death to any of us."
\par 
\par Adam sat up quickly.
\par 
\par "Do tell me, sir, what is in your mind--if, of course, you have no
\par objection, or do not think it better to withhold it."
\par 
\par "I have no objection, Adam--in fact, if I had, I should have to overcome
\par it.  I fear there can be no more reserved thoughts between us."
\par 
\par "Indeed, sir, that sounds serious, worse than serious!"
\par 
\par "Adam, I greatly fear that the time has come for us--for you and me, at
\par all events--to speak out plainly to one another.  Does not there seem
\par something very mysterious about this?"
\par 
\par "I have thought so, sir, all along.  The only difficulty one has is what
\par one is to think and where to begin."
\par 
\par "Let us begin with what you have told me.  First take the conduct of the
\par mongoose.  He was quiet, even friendly and affectionate with you.  He
\par only attacked the snakes, which is, after all, his business in life."
\par 
\par "That is so!"
\par 
\par "Then we must try to find some reason why he attacked Lady Arabella."
\par 
\par "May it not be that a mongoose may have merely the instinct to attack,
\par that nature does not allow or provide him with the fine reasoning powers
\par to discriminate who he is to attack?"
\par 
\par "Of course that may be so.  But, on the other hand, should we not satisfy
\par ourselves why he does wish to attack anything?  If for centuries, this
\par particular animal is known to attack only one kind of other animal, are
\par we not justified in assuming that when one of them attacks a hitherto
\par unclassed animal, he recognises in that animal some quality which it has
\par in common with the hereditary enemy?"
\par 
\par "That is a good argument, sir," Adam went on, "but a dangerous one.  If
\par we followed it out, it would lead us to believe that Lady Arabella is a
\par snake."
\par 
\par "We must be sure, before going to such an end, that there is no point as
\par yet unconsidered which would account for the unknown thing which puzzles
\par us."
\par 
\par "In what way?"
\par 
\par "Well, suppose the instinct works on some physical basis--for instance,
\par smell.  If there were anything in recent juxtaposition to the attacked
\par which would carry the scent, surely that would supply the missing cause."
\par 
\par "Of course!" Adam spoke with conviction.
\par 
\par "Now, from what you tell me, the negro had just come from the direction
\par of Diana's Grove, carrying the dead snakes which the mongoose had killed
\par the previous morning.  Might not the scent have been carried that way?"
\par 
\par "Of course it might, and probably was.  I never thought of that.  Is
\par there any possible way of guessing approximately how long a scent will
\par remain?  You see, this is a natural scent, and may derive from a place
\par where it has been effective for thousands of years.  Then, does a scent
\par of any kind carry with it any form or quality of another kind, either
\par good or evil?  I ask you because one ancient name of the house lived in
\par by the lady who was attacked by the mongoose was 'The Lair of the White
\par Worm.'  If any of these things be so, our difficulties have multiplied
\par indefinitely.  They may even change in kind.  We may get into moral
\par entanglements; before we know it, we may be in the midst of a struggle
\par between good and evil."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel smiled gravely.
\par 
\par "With regard to the first question--so far as I know, there are no fixed
\par periods for which a scent may be active--I think we may take it that that
\par period does not run into thousands of years.  As to whether any moral
\par change accompanies a physical one, I can only say that I have met no
\par proof of the fact.  At the same time, we must remember that 'good' and
\par 'evil' are terms so wide as to take in the whole scheme of creation, and
\par all that is implied by them and by their mutual action and reaction.
\par Generally, I would say that in the scheme of a First Cause anything is
\par possible.  So long as the inherent forces or tendencies of any one thing
\par are veiled from us we must expect mystery."
\par 
\par "There is one other question on which I should like to ask your opinion.
\par Suppose that there are any permanent forces appertaining to the past,
\par what we may call 'survivals,' do these belong to good as well as to evil?
\par For instance, if the scent of the primaeval monster can so remain in
\par proportion to the original strength, can the same be true of things of
\par good import?"
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel thought for a while before he answered.
\par 
\par "We must be careful not to confuse the physical and the moral.  I can see
\par that already you have switched on the moral entirely, so perhaps we had
\par better follow it up first.  On the side of the moral, we have certain
\par justification for belief in the utterances of revealed religion.  For
\par instance, 'the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much'
\par is altogether for good.  We have nothing of a similar kind on the side of
\par evil.  But if we accept this dictum we need have no more fear of
\par 'mysteries': these become thenceforth merely obstacles."
\par 
\par Adam suddenly changed to another phase of the subject.
\par 
\par "And now, sir, may I turn for a few minutes to purely practical things,
\par or rather to matters of historical fact?"
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel bowed acquiescence.
\par 
\par "We have already spoken of the history, so far as it is known, of some of
\par the places round us--'Castra Regis,' 'Diana's Grove,' and 'The Lair of
\par the White Worm.'  I would like to ask if there is anything not
\par necessarily of evil import about any of the places?"
\par 
\par "Which?" asked Sir Nathaniel shrewdly.
\par 
\par "Well, for instance, this house and Mercy Farm?"
\par 
\par "Here we turn," said Sir Nathaniel, "to the other side, the light side of
\par things.  Let us take Mercy Farm first.  When Augustine was sent by Pope
\par Gregory to Christianise England, in the time of the Romans, he was
\par received and protected by Ethelbert, King of Kent, whose wife, daughter
\par of Charibert, King of Paris, was a Christian, and did much for Augustine.
\par She founded a nunnery in memory of Columba, which was named _Sedes
\par misericordioe_, the House of Mercy, and, as the region was Mercian, the
\par two names became involved.  As Columba is the Latin for dove, the dove
\par became a sort of signification of the nunnery.  She seized on the idea
\par and made the newly-founded nunnery a house of doves.  Someone sent her a
\par freshly-discovered dove, a sort of carrier, but which had in the white
\par feathers of its head and neck the form of a religious cowl.  The nunnery
\par flourished for more than a century, when, in the time of Penda, who was
\par the reactionary of heathendom, it fell into decay.  In the meantime the
\par doves, protected by religious feeling, had increased mightily, and were
\par known in all Catholic communities.  When King Offa ruled in Mercia, about
\par a hundred and fifty years later, he restored Christianity, and under its
\par protection the nunnery of St. Columba was restored and its doves
\par flourished again.  In process of time this religious house again fell
\par into desuetude; but before it disappeared it had achieved a great name
\par for good works, and in especial for the piety of its members.  If deeds
\par and prayers and hopes and earnest thinking leave anywhere any moral
\par effect, Mercy Farm and all around it have almost the right to be
\par considered holy ground."
\par 
\par "Thank you, sir," said Adam earnestly, and was silent.  Sir Nathaniel
\par understood.
\par 
\par After lunch that day, Adam casually asked Sir Nathaniel to come for a
\par walk with him.  The keen-witted old diplomatist guessed that there must
\par be some motive behind the suggestion, and he at once agreed.
\par 
\par As soon as they were free from observation, Adam began.
\par 
\par "I am afraid, sir, that there is more going on in this neighbourhood than
\par most people imagine.  I was out this morning, and on the edge of the
\par small wood, I came upon the body of a child by the roadside.  At first, I
\par thought she was dead, and while examining her, I noticed on her neck some
\par marks that looked like those of teeth."
\par 
\par "Some wild dog, perhaps?" put in Sir Nathaniel.
\par 
\par "Possibly, sir, though I think not--but listen to the rest of my news.  I
\par glanced around, and to my surprise, I noticed something white moving
\par among the trees.  I placed the child down carefully, and followed, but I
\par could not find any further traces.  So I returned to the child and
\par resumed my examination, and, to my delight, I discovered that she was
\par still alive.  I chafed her hands and gradually she revived, but to my
\par disappointment she remembered nothing--except that something had crept up
\par quietly from behind, and had gripped her round the throat.  Then,
\par apparently, she fainted."
\par 
\par "Gripped her round the throat!  Then it cannot have been a dog."
\par 
\par "No, sir, that is my difficulty, and explains why I brought you out here,
\par where we cannot possibly be overheard.  You have noticed, of course, the
\par peculiar sinuous way in which Lady Arabella moves--well, I feel certain
\par that the white thing that I saw in the wood was the mistress of Diana's
\par Grove!"
\par 
\par "Good God, boy, be careful what you say."
\par 
\par "Yes, sir, I fully realise the gravity of my accusation, but I feel
\par convinced that the marks on the child's throat were human--and made by a
\par woman."
\par 
\par Adam's companion remained silent for some time, deep in thought.
\par 
\par "Adam, my boy," he said at last, "this matter appears to me to be far
\par more serious even than you think.  It forces me to break confidence with
\par my old friend, your uncle--but, in order to spare him, I must do so.  For
\par some time now, things have been happening in this district that have been
\par worrying him dreadfully--several people have disappeared, without leaving
\par the slightest trace; a dead child was found by the roadside, with no
\par visible or ascertainable cause of death--sheep and other animals have
\par been found in the fields, bleeding from open wounds.  There have been
\par other matters--many of them apparently trivial in themselves.  Some
\par sinister influence has been at work, and I admit that I have suspected
\par Lady Arabella--that is why I questioned you so closely about the mongoose
\par and its strange attack upon Lady Arabella.  You will think it strange
\par that I should suspect the mistress of Diana's Grove, a beautiful woman of
\par aristocratic birth.  Let me explain--the family seat is near my own
\par place, Doom Tower, and at one time I knew the family well.  When still a
\par young girl, Lady Arabella wandered into a small wood near her home, and
\par did not return.  She was found unconscious and in a high fever--the
\par doctor said that she had received a poisonous bite, and the girl being at
\par a delicate and critical age, the result was serious--so much so that she
\par was not expected to recover.  A great London physician came down but
\par could do nothing--indeed, he said that the girl would not survive the
\par night.  All hope had been abandoned, when, to everyone's surprise, Lady
\par Arabella made a sudden and startling recovery.  Within a couple of days
\par she was going about as usual!  But to the horror of her people, she
\par developed a terrible craving for cruelty, maiming and injuring birds and
\par small animals--even killing them.  This was put down to a nervous
\par disturbance due to her age, and it was hoped that her marriage to Captain
\par March would put this right.  However, it was not a happy marriage, and
\par eventually her husband was found shot through the head.  I have always
\par suspected suicide, though no pistol was found near the body.  He may have
\par discovered something--God knows what!--so possibly Lady Arabella may
\par herself have killed him.  Putting together many small matters that have
\par come to my knowledge, I have come to the conclusion that the foul White
\par Worm obtained control of her body, just as her soul was leaving its
\par earthly tenement--that would explain the sudden revival of energy, the
\par strange and inexplicable craving for maiming and killing, as well as many
\par other matters with which I need not trouble you now, Adam.  As I said
\par just now, God alone knows what poor Captain March discovered--it must
\par have been something too ghastly for human endurance, if my theory is
\par correct that the once beautiful human body of Lady Arabella is under the
\par control of this ghastly White Worm."
\par 
\par Adam nodded.
\par 
\par "But what can we do, sir--it seems a most difficult problem."
\par 
\par "We can do nothing, my boy--that is the important part of it.  It would
\par be impossible to take action--all we can do is to keep careful watch,
\par especially as regards Lady Arabella, and be ready to act, promptly and
\par decisively, if the opportunity occurs."
\par 
\par Adam agreed, and the two men returned to Lesser Hill.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER IX--SMELLING DEATH
\par 
\par 
\par Adam Salton, though he talked little, did not let the grass grow under
\par his feet in any matter which he had undertaken, or in which he was
\par interested.  He had agreed with Sir Nathaniel that they should not do
\par anything with regard to the mystery of Lady Arabella's fear of the
\par mongoose, but he steadily pursued his course in being _prepared_ to act
\par whenever the opportunity might come.  He was in his own mind perpetually
\par casting about for information or clues which might lead to possible lines
\par of action.  Baffled by the killing of the mongoose, he looked around for
\par another line to follow.  He was fascinated by the idea of there being a
\par mysterious link between the woman and the animal, but he was already
\par preparing a second string to his bow.  His new idea was to use the
\par faculties of Oolanga, so far as he could, in the service of discovery.
\par His first move was to send Davenport to Liverpool to try to find the
\par steward of the _West African_, who had told him about Oolanga, and if
\par possible secure any further information, and then try to induce (by
\par bribery or other means) the nigger to come to the Brow.  So soon as he
\par himself could have speech of the Voodoo-man he would be able to learn
\par from him something useful.  Davenport was successful in his missions, for
\par he had to get another mongoose, and he was able to tell Adam that he had
\par seen the steward, who told him much that he wanted to know, and had also
\par arranged for Oolanga to come to Lesser Hill the following day.  At this
\par point Adam saw his way sufficiently clear to admit Davenport to some
\par extent into his confidence.  He had come to the conclusion that it would
\par be better--certainly at first--not himself to appear in the matter, with
\par which Davenport was fully competent to deal.  It would be time for
\par himself to take a personal part when matters had advanced a little
\par further.
\par 
\par If what the nigger said was in any wise true, the man had a rare gift
\par which might be useful in the quest they were after.  He could, as it
\par were, "smell death."  If any one was dead, if any one had died, or if a
\par place had been used in connection with death, he seemed to know the broad
\par fact by intuition.  Adam made up his mind that to test this faculty with
\par regard to several places would be his first task.  Naturally he was
\par anxious, and the time passed slowly.  The only comfort was the arrival
\par the next morning of a strong packing case, locked, from Ross, the key
\par being in the custody of Davenport.  In the case were two smaller boxes,
\par both locked.  One of them contained a mongoose to replace that killed by
\par Lady Arabella; the other was the special mongoose which had already
\par killed the king-cobra in Nepaul.  When both the animals had been safely
\par put under lock and key, he felt that he might breathe more freely.  No
\par one was allowed to know the secret of their existence in the house,
\par except himself and Davenport.  He arranged that Davenport should take
\par Oolanga round the neighbourhood for a walk, stopping at each of the
\par places which he designated.  Having gone all along the Brow, he was to
\par return the same way and induce him to touch on the same subjects in
\par talking with Adam, who was to meet them as if by chance at the farthest
\par part--that beyond Mercy Farm.
\par 
\par The incidents of the day proved much as Adam expected.  At Mercy Farm, at
\par Diana's Grove, at Castra Regis, and a few other spots, the negro stopped
\par and, opening his wide nostrils as if to sniff boldly, said that he
\par smelled death.  It was not always in the same form.  At Mercy Farm he
\par said there were many small deaths.  At Diana's Grove his bearing was
\par different.  There was a distinct sense of enjoyment about him, especially
\par when he spoke of many great deaths.  Here, too, he sniffed in a strange
\par way, like a bloodhound at check, and looked puzzled.  He said no word in
\par either praise or disparagement, but in the centre of the Grove, where,
\par hidden amongst ancient oak stumps, was a block of granite slightly
\par hollowed on the top, he bent low and placed his forehead on the ground.
\par This was the only place where he showed distinct reverence.  At the
\par Castle, though he spoke of much death, he showed no sign of respect.
\par 
\par There was evidently something about Diana's Grove which both interested
\par and baffled him.  Before leaving, he moved all over the place
\par unsatisfied, and in one spot, close to the edge of the Brow, where there
\par was a deep hollow, he appeared to be afraid.  After returning several
\par times to this place, he suddenly turned and ran in a panic of fear to the
\par higher ground, crossing as he did so the outcropping rock.  Then he
\par seemed to breathe more freely, and recovered some of his jaunty
\par impudence.
\par 
\par All this seemed to satisfy Adam's expectations.  He went back to Lesser
\par Hill with a serene and settled calm upon him.  Sir Nathaniel followed him
\par into his study.
\par 
\par "By the way, I forgot to ask you details about one thing.  When that
\par extraordinary staring episode of Mr. Caswall went on, how did Lilla take
\par it--how did she bear herself?"
\par 
\par "She looked frightened, and trembled just as I have seen a pigeon with a
\par hawk, or a bird with a serpent."
\par 
\par "Thanks.  It is just as I expected.  There have been circumstances in the
\par Caswall family which lead one to believe that they have had from the
\par earliest times some extraordinary mesmeric or hypnotic faculty.  Indeed,
\par a skilled eye could read so much in their physiognomy.  That shot of
\par yours, whether by instinct or intention, of the hawk and the pigeon was
\par peculiarly apposite.  I think we may settle on that as a fixed trait to
\par be accepted throughout our investigation."
\par 
\par When dusk had fallen, Adam took the new mongoose--not the one from
\par Nepaul--and, carrying the box slung over his shoulder, strolled towards
\par Diana's Grove.  Close to the gateway he met Lady Arabella, clad as usual
\par in tightly fitting white, which showed off her slim figure.
\par 
\par To his intense astonishment the mongoose allowed her to pet him, take him
\par up in her arms and fondle him.  As she was going in his direction, they
\par walked on together.
\par 
\par Round the roadway between the entrances of Diana's Grove and Lesser Hill
\par were many trees, with not much foliage except at the top.  In the dusk
\par this place was shadowy, and the view was hampered by the clustering
\par trunks.  In the uncertain, tremulous light which fell through the tree-
\par tops, it was hard to distinguish anything clearly, and at last, somehow,
\par he lost sight of her altogether, and turned back on his track to find
\par her.  Presently he came across her close to her own gate.  She was
\par leaning over the paling of split oak branches which formed the paling of
\par the avenue.  He could not see the mongoose, so he asked her where it had
\par gone.
\par 
\par "He slipt out of my arms while I was petting him," she answered, "and
\par disappeared under the hedges."
\par 
\par They found him at a place where the avenue widened so as to let carriages
\par pass each other.  The little creature seemed quite changed.  He had been
\par ebulliently active; now he was dull and spiritless--seemed to be dazed.
\par He allowed himself to be lifted by either of the pair; but when he was
\par alone with Lady Arabella he kept looking round him in a strange way, as
\par though trying to escape.  When they had come out on the roadway Adam held
\par the mongoose tight to him, and, lifting his hat to his companion, moved
\par quickly towards Lesser Hill; he and Lady Arabella lost sight of each
\par other in the thickening gloom.
\par 
\par When Adam got home, he put the mongoose in his box, and locked the door
\par of the room.  The other mongoose--the one from Nepaul--was safely locked
\par in his own box, but he lay quiet and did not stir.  When he got to his
\par study Sir Nathaniel came in, shutting the door behind him.
\par 
\par "I have come," he said, "while we have an opportunity of being alone, to
\par tell you something of the Caswall family which I think will interest you.
\par There is, or used to be, a belief in this part of the world that the
\par Caswall family had some strange power of making the wills of other
\par persons subservient to their own.  There are many allusions to the
\par subject in memoirs and other unimportant works, but I only know of one
\par where the subject is spoken of definitely.  It is _Mercia and its
\par Worthies_, written by Ezra Toms more than a hundred years ago.  The
\par author goes into the question of the close association of the then Edgar
\par Caswall with Mesmer in Paris.  He speaks of Caswall being a pupil and the
\par fellow worker of Mesmer, and states that though, when the latter left
\par France, he took away with him a vast quantity of philosophical and
\par electric instruments, he was never known to use them again.  He once made
\par it known to a friend that he had given them to his old pupil.  The term
\par he used was odd, for it was 'bequeathed,' but no such bequest of Mesmer
\par was ever made known.  At any rate the instruments were missing, and never
\par turned up."
\par 
\par A servant came into the room to tell Adam that there was some strange
\par noise coming from the locked room into which he had gone when he came in.
\par He hurried off to the place at once, Sir Nathaniel going with him.  Having
\par locked the door behind them, Adam opened the packing-case where the boxes
\par of the two mongooses were locked up.  There was no sound from one of
\par them, but from the other a queer restless struggling.  Having opened both
\par boxes, he found that the noise was from the Nepaul animal, which,
\par however, became quiet at once.  In the other box the new mongoose lay
\par dead, with every appearance of having been strangled!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER X--THE KITE
\par 
\par 
\par On the following day, a little after four o'clock, Adam set out for
\par Mercy.
\par 
\par He was home just as the clocks were striking six.  He was pale and upset,
\par but otherwise looked strong and alert.  The old man summed up his
\par appearance and manner thus: "Braced up for battle."
\par 
\par "Now!" said Sir Nathaniel, and settled down to listen, looking at Adam
\par steadily and listening attentively that he might miss nothing--even the
\par inflection of a word.
\par 
\par "I found Lilla and Mimi at home.  Watford had been detained by business
\par on the farm.  Miss Watford received me as kindly as before; Mimi, too,
\par seemed glad to see me.  Mr. Caswall came so soon after I arrived, that
\par he, or someone on his behalf, must have been watching for me.  He was
\par followed closely by the negro, who was puffing hard as if he had been
\par running--so it was probably he who watched.  Mr. Caswall was very cool
\par and collected, but there was a more than usually iron look about his face
\par that I did not like.  However, we got on very well.  He talked pleasantly
\par on all sorts of questions.  The nigger waited a while and then
\par disappeared as on the other occasion.  Mr. Caswall's eyes were as usual
\par fixed on Lilla.  True, they seemed to be very deep and earnest, but there
\par was no offence in them.  Had it not been for the drawing down of the
\par brows and the stern set of the jaws, I should not at first have noticed
\par anything.  But the stare, when presently it began, increased in
\par intensity.  I could see that Lilla began to suffer from nervousness, as
\par on the first occasion; but she carried herself bravely.  However, the
\par more nervous she grew, the harder Mr. Caswall stared.  It was evident to
\par me that he had come prepared for some sort of mesmeric or hypnotic
\par battle.  After a while he began to throw glances round him and then
\par raised his hand, without letting either Lilla or Mimi see the action.  It
\par was evidently intended to give some sign to the negro, for he came, in
\par his usual stealthy way, quietly in by the hall door, which was open.  Then
\par Mr. Caswall's efforts at staring became intensified, and poor Lilla's
\par nervousness grew greater.  Mimi, seeing that her cousin was distressed,
\par came close to her, as if to comfort or strengthen her with the
\par consciousness of her presence.  This evidently made a difficulty for Mr.
\par Caswall, for his efforts, without appearing to get feebler, seemed less
\par effective.  This continued for a little while, to the gain of both Lilla
\par and Mimi.  Then there was a diversion.  Without word or apology the door
\par opened, and Lady Arabella March entered the room.  I had seen her coming
\par through the great window.  Without a word she crossed the room and stood
\par beside Mr. Caswall.  It really was very like a fight of a peculiar kind;
\par and the longer it was sustained the more earnest--the fiercer--it grew.
\par That combination of forces--the over-lord, the white woman, and the black
\par man--would have cost some--probably all of them--their lives in the
\par Southern States of America.  To us it was simply horrible.  But all that
\par you can understand.  This time, to go on in sporting phrase, it was
\par understood by all to be a 'fight to a finish,' and the mixed group did
\par not slacken a moment or relax their efforts.  On Lilla the strain began
\par to tell disastrously.  She grew pale--a patchy pallor, which meant that
\par her nerves were out of order.  She trembled like an aspen, and though she
\par struggled bravely, I noticed that her legs would hardly support her.  A
\par dozen times she seemed about to collapse in a faint, but each time, on
\par catching sight of Mimi's eyes, she made a fresh struggle and pulled
\par through.
\par 
\par "By now Mr. Caswall's face had lost its appearance of passivity.  His
\par eyes glowed with a fiery light.  He was still the old Roman in
\par inflexibility of purpose; but grafted on to the Roman was a new Berserker
\par fury.  His companions in the baleful work seemed to have taken on
\par something of his feeling.  Lady Arabella looked like a soulless, pitiless
\par being, not human, unless it revived old legends of transformed human
\par beings who had lost their humanity in some transformation or in the sweep
\par of natural savagery.  As for the negro--well, I can only say that it was
\par solely due to the self-restraint which you impressed on me that I did not
\par wipe him out as he stood--without warning, without fair play--without a
\par single one of the graces of life and death.  Lilla was silent in the
\par helpless concentration of deadly fear; Mimi was all resolve and
\par self-forgetfulness, so intent on the soul-struggle in which she was
\par engaged that there was no possibility of any other thought.  As for
\par myself, the bonds of will which held me inactive seemed like bands of
\par steel which numbed all my faculties, except sight and hearing.  We seemed
\par fixed in an _impasse_.  Something must happen, though the power of
\par guessing was inactive.  As in a dream, I saw Mimi's hand move restlessly,
\par as if groping for something.  Mechanically it touched that of Lilla, and
\par in that instant she was transformed.  It was as if youth and strength
\par entered afresh into something already dead to sensibility and intention.
\par As if by inspiration, she grasped the other's band with a force which
\par blenched the knuckles.  Her face suddenly flamed, as if some divine light
\par shone through it.  Her form expanded till it stood out majestically.
\par Lifting her right hand, she stepped forward towards Caswall, and with a
\par bold sweep of her arm seemed to drive some strange force towards him.
\par Again and again was the gesture repeated, the man falling back from her
\par at each movement.  Towards the door he retreated, she following.  There
\par was a sound as of the cooing sob of doves, which seemed to multiply and
\par intensify with each second.  The sound from the unseen source rose and
\par rose as he retreated, till finally it swelled out in a triumphant peal,
\par as she with a fierce sweep of her arm, seemed to hurl something at her
\par foe, and he, moving his hands blindly before his face, appeared to be
\par swept through the doorway and out into the open sunlight.
\par 
\par "All at once my own faculties were fully restored; I could see and hear
\par everything, and be fully conscious of what was going on.  Even the
\par figures of the baleful group were there, though dimly seen as through a
\par veil--a shadowy veil.  I saw Lilla sink down in a swoon, and Mimi throw
\par up her arms in a gesture of triumph.  As I saw her through the great
\par window, the sunshine flooded the landscape, which, however, was
\par momentarily becoming eclipsed by an onrush of a myriad birds."
\par 
\par By the next morning, daylight showed the actual danger which threatened.
\par From every part of the eastern counties reports were received concerning
\par the enormous immigration of birds.  Experts were sending--on their own
\par account, on behalf of learned societies, and through local and imperial
\par governing bodies--reports dealing with the matter, and suggesting
\par remedies.
\par 
\par The reports closer to home were even more disturbing.  All day long it
\par would seem that the birds were coming thicker from all quarters.
\par Doubtless many were going as well as coming, but the mass seemed never to
\par get less.  Each bird seemed to sound some note of fear or anger or
\par seeking, and the whirring of wings never ceased nor lessened.  The air
\par was full of a muttered throb.  No window or barrier could shut out the
\par sound, till the ears of any listener became dulled by the ceaseless
\par murmur.  So monotonous it was, so cheerless, so disheartening, so
\par melancholy, that all longed, but in vain, for any variety, no matter how
\par terrible it might be.
\par 
\par The second morning the reports from all the districts round were more
\par alarming than ever.  Farmers began to dread the coming of winter as they
\par saw the dwindling of the timely fruitfulness of the earth.  And as yet it
\par was only a warning of evil, not the evil accomplished; the ground began
\par to look bare whenever some passing sound temporarily frightened the
\par birds.
\par 
\par Edgar Caswall tortured his brain for a long time unavailingly, to think
\par of some means of getting rid of what he, as well as his neighbours, had
\par come to regard as a plague of birds.  At last he recalled a circumstance
\par which promised a solution of the difficulty.  The experience was of some
\par years ago in China, far up-country, towards the head-waters of the Yang-
\par tze-kiang, where the smaller tributaries spread out in a sort of natural
\par irrigation scheme to supply the wilderness of paddy-fields.  It was at
\par the time of the ripening rice, and the myriads of birds which came to
\par feed on the coming crop was a serious menace, not only to the district,
\par but to the country at large.  The farmers, who were more or less
\par afflicted with the same trouble every season, knew how to deal with it.
\par They made a vast kite, which they caused to be flown over the centre spot
\par of the incursion.  The kite was shaped like a great hawk; and the moment
\par it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek protection--and
\par then to disappear.  So long as that kite was flying overhead the birds
\par lay low and the crop was saved.  Accordingly Caswall ordered his men to
\par construct an immense kite, adhering as well as they could to the lines of
\par a hawk.  Then he and his men, with a sufficiency of cord, began to fly it
\par high overhead.  The experience of China was repeated.  The moment the
\par kite rose, the birds hid or sought shelter.  The following morning, the
\par kite was still flying high, no bird was to be seen as far as the eye
\par could reach from Castra Regis.  But there followed in turn what proved
\par even a worse evil.  All the birds were cowed; their sounds stopped.
\par Neither song nor chirp was heard--silence seemed to have taken the place
\par of the normal voices of bird life.  But that was not all.  The silence
\par spread to all animals.
\par 
\par The fear and restraint which brooded amongst the denizens of the air
\par began to affect all life.  Not only did the birds cease song or chirp,
\par but the lowing of the cattle ceased in the fields and the varied sounds
\par of life died away.  In place of these things was only a soundless gloom,
\par more dreadful, more disheartening, more soul-killing than any concourse
\par of sounds, no matter how full of fear and dread.  Pious individuals put
\par up constant prayers for relief from the intolerable solitude.  After a
\par little there were signs of universal depression which those who ran might
\par read.  One and all, the faces of men and women seemed bereft of vitality,
\par of interest, of thought, and, most of all, of hope.  Men seemed to have
\par lost the power of expression of their thoughts.  The soundless air seemed
\par to have the same effect as the universal darkness when men gnawed their
\par tongues with pain.
\par 
\par From this infliction of silence there was no relief.  Everything was
\par affected; gloom was the predominant note.  Joy appeared to have passed
\par away as a factor of life, and this creative impulse had nothing to take
\par its place.  That giant spot in high air was a plague of evil influence.
\par It seemed like a new misanthropic belief which had fallen on human
\par beings, carrying with it the negation of all hope.
\par 
\par After a few days, men began to grow desperate; their very words as well
\par as their senses seemed to be in chains.  Edgar Caswall again tortured his
\par brain to find any antidote or palliative of this greater evil than
\par before.  He would gladly have destroyed the kite, or caused its flying to
\par cease; but the instant it was pulled down, the birds rose up in even
\par greater numbers; all those who depended in any way on agriculture sent
\par pitiful protests to Castra Regis.
\par 
\par It was strange indeed what influence that weird kite seemed to exercise.
\par Even human beings were affected by it, as if both it and they were
\par realities.  As for the people at Mercy Farm, it was like a taste of
\par actual death.  Lilla felt it most.  If she had been indeed a real dove,
\par with a real kite hanging over her in the air, she could not have been
\par more frightened or more affected by the terror this created.
\par 
\par Of course, some of those already drawn into the vortex noticed the effect
\par on individuals.  Those who were interested took care to compare their
\par information.  Strangely enough, as it seemed to the others, the person
\par who took the ghastly silence least to heart was the negro.  By nature he
\par was not sensitive to, or afflicted by, nerves.  This alone would not have
\par produced the seeming indifference, so they set their minds to discover
\par the real cause.  Adam came quickly to the conclusion that there was for
\par him some compensation that the others did not share; and he soon believed
\par that that compensation was in one form or another the enjoyment of the
\par sufferings of others.  Thus the black had a never-failing source of
\par amusement.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella's cold nature rendered her immune to anything in the way of
\par pain or trouble concerning others.  Edgar Caswall was far too haughty a
\par person, and too stern of nature, to concern himself about poor or
\par helpless people, much less the lower order of mere animals.  Mr. Watford,
\par Mr. Salton, and Sir Nathaniel were all concerned in the issue, partly
\par from kindness of heart--for none of them could see suffering, even of
\par wild birds, unmoved--and partly on account of their property, which had
\par to be protected, or ruin would stare them in the face before long.
\par 
\par Lilla suffered acutely.  As time went on, her face became pinched, and
\par her eyes dull with watching and crying.  Mimi suffered too on account of
\par her cousin's suffering.  But as she could do nothing, she resolutely made
\par up her mind to self-restraint and patience.  Adam's frequent visits
\par comforted her.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XI--MESMER'S CHEST
\par 
\par 
\par After a couple of weeks had passed, the kite seemed to give Edgar Caswall
\par a new zest for life.  He was never tired of looking at its movements.  He
\par had a comfortable armchair put out on the tower, wherein he sat sometimes
\par all day long, watching as though the kite was a new toy and he a child
\par lately come into possession of it.  He did not seem to have lost interest
\par in Lilla, for he still paid an occasional visit at Mercy Farm.
\par 
\par Indeed, his feeling towards her, whatever it had been at first, had now
\par so far changed that it had become a distinct affection of a purely animal
\par kind.  Indeed, it seemed as though the man's nature had become corrupted,
\par and that all the baser and more selfish and more reckless qualities had
\par become more conspicuous.  There was not so much sternness apparent in his
\par nature, because there was less self-restraint.  Determination had become
\par indifference.
\par 
\par The visible change in Edgar was that he grew morbid, sad, silent; the
\par neighbours thought he was going mad.  He became absorbed in the kite, and
\par watched it not only by day, but often all night long.  It became an
\par obsession to him.
\par 
\par Caswall took a personal interest in the keeping of the great kite flying.
\par He had a vast coil of cord efficient for the purpose, which worked on a
\par roller fixed on the parapet of the tower.  There was a winch for the
\par pulling in of the slack; the outgoing line being controlled by a racket.
\par There was invariably one man at least, day and night, on the tower to
\par attend to it.  At such an elevation there was always a strong wind, and
\par at times the kite rose to an enormous height, as well as travelling for
\par great distances laterally.  In fact, the kite became, in a short time,
\par one of the curiosities of Castra Regis and all around it.  Edgar began to
\par attribute to it, in his own mind, almost human qualities.  It became to
\par him a separate entity, with a mind and a soul of its own.  Being idle-
\par handed all day, he began to apply to what he considered the service of
\par the kite some of his spare time, and found a new pleasure--a new object
\par in life--in the old schoolboy game of sending up "runners" to the kite.
\par The way this is done is to get round pieces of paper so cut that there is
\par a hole in the centre, through which the string of the kite passes.  The
\par natural action of the wind-pressure takes the paper along the string, and
\par so up to the kite itself, no matter how high or how far it may have gone.
\par 
\par In the early days of this amusement Edgar Caswall spent hours.  Hundreds
\par of such messengers flew along the string, until soon he bethought him of
\par writing messages on these papers so that he could make known his ideas to
\par the kite.  It may be that his brain gave way under the opportunities
\par given by his illusion of the entity of the toy and its power of separate
\par thought.  From sending messages he came to making direct speech to the
\par kite--without, however, ceasing to send the runners.  Doubtless, the
\par height of the tower, seated as it was on the hill-top, the rushing of the
\par ceaseless wind, the hypnotic effect of the lofty altitude of the speck in
\par the sky at which he gazed, and the rushing of the paper messengers up the
\par string till sight of them was lost in distance, all helped to further
\par affect his brain, undoubtedly giving way under the strain of beliefs and
\par circumstances which were at once stimulating to the imagination,
\par occupative of his mind, and absorbing.
\par 
\par The next step of intellectual decline was to bring to bear on the main
\par idea of the conscious identity of the kite all sorts of subjects which
\par had imaginative force or tendency of their own.  He had, in Castra Regis,
\par a large collection of curious and interesting things formed in the past
\par by his forebears, of similar tastes to his own.  There were all sorts of
\par strange anthropological specimens, both old and new, which had been
\par collected through various travels in strange places: ancient Egyptian
\par relics from tombs and mummies; curios from Australia, New Zealand, and
\par the South Seas; idols and images--from Tartar ikons to ancient Egyptian,
\par Persian, and Indian objects of worship; objects of death and torture of
\par American Indians; and, above all, a vast collection of lethal weapons of
\par every kind and from every place--Chinese "high pinders," double knives,
\par Afghan double-edged scimitars made to cut a body in two, heavy knives
\par from all the Eastern countries, ghost daggers from Thibet, the terrible
\par kukri of the Ghourka and other hill tribes of India, assassins' weapons
\par from Italy and Spain, even the knife which was formerly carried by the
\par slave-drivers of the Mississippi region.  Death and pain of every kind
\par were fully represented in that gruesome collection.
\par 
\par That it had a fascination for Oolanga goes without saying.  He was never
\par tired of visiting the museum in the tower, and spent endless hours in
\par inspecting the exhibits, till he was thoroughly familiar with every
\par detail of all of them.  He asked permission to clean and polish and
\par sharpen them--a favour which was readily granted.  In addition to the
\par above objects, there were many things of a kind to awaken human fear.
\par Stuffed serpents of the most objectionable and horrid kind; giant insects
\par from the tropics, fearsome in every detail; fishes and crustaceans
\par covered with weird spikes; dried octopuses of great size.  Other things,
\par too, there were, not less deadly though seemingly innocuous--dried fungi,
\par traps intended for birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, and insects; machines
\par which could produce pain of any kind and degree, and the only mercy of
\par which was the power of producing speedy death.
\par 
\par Caswall, who had never before seen any of these things, except those
\par which he had collected himself, found a constant amusement and interest
\par in them.  He studied them, their uses, their mechanism--where there was
\par such--and their places of origin, until he had an ample and real
\par knowledge of all concerning them.  Many were secret and intricate, but he
\par never rested till he found out all the secrets.  When once he had become
\par interested in strange objects, and the way to use them, he began to
\par explore various likely places for similar finds.  He began to inquire of
\par his household where strange lumber was kept.  Several of the men spoke of
\par old Simon Chester as one who knew everything in and about the house.
\par Accordingly, he sent for the old man, who came at once.  He was very old,
\par nearly ninety years of age, and very infirm.  He had been born in the
\par Castle, and had served its succession of masters--present or absent--ever
\par since.  When Edgar began to question him on the subject regarding which
\par he had sent for him, old Simon exhibited much perturbation.  In fact, he
\par became so frightened that his master, fully believing that he was
\par concealing something, ordered him to tell at once what remained unseen,
\par and where it was hidden away.  Face to face with discovery of his secret,
\par the old man, in a pitiable state of concern, spoke out even more fully
\par than Mr. Caswall had expected.
\par 
\par "Indeed, indeed, sir, everything is here in the tower that has ever been
\par put away in my time except--except--" here he began to shake and tremble
\par it--"except the chest which Mr. Edgar--he who was Mr. Edgar when I first
\par took service--brought back from France, after he had been with Dr.
\par Mesmer.  The trunk has been kept in my room for safety; but I shall send
\par it down here now."
\par 
\par "What is in it?" asked Edgar sharply.
\par 
\par "That I do not know.  Moreover, it is a peculiar trunk, without any
\par visible means of opening."
\par 
\par "Is there no lock?"
\par 
\par "I suppose so, sir; but I do not know.  There is no keyhole."
\par 
\par "Send it here; and then come to me yourself."
\par 
\par The trunk, a heavy one with steel bands round it, but no lock or keyhole,
\par was carried in by two men.  Shortly afterwards old Simon attended his
\par master.  When he came into the room, Mr. Caswall himself went and closed
\par the door; then he asked:
\par 
\par "How do you open it?"
\par 
\par "I do not know, sir."
\par 
\par "Do you mean to say that you never opened it?"
\par 
\par "Most certainly I say so, your honour.  How could I?  It was entrusted to
\par me with the other things by my master.  To open it would have been a
\par breach of trust."
\par 
\par Caswall sneered.
\par 
\par "Quite remarkable!  Leave it with me.  Close the door behind you.
\par Stay--did no one ever tell you about it--say anything regarding it--make
\par any remark?"
\par 
\par Old Simon turned pale, and put his trembling hands together.
\par 
\par "Oh, sir, I entreat you not to touch it.  That trunk probably contains
\par secrets which Dr. Mesmer told my master.  Told them to his ruin!"
\par 
\par "How do you mean?  What ruin?"
\par 
\par "Sir, he it was who, men said, sold his soul to the Evil One; I had
\par thought that that time and the evil of it had all passed away."
\par 
\par "That will do.  Go away; but remain in your own room, or within call.  I
\par may want you."
\par 
\par The old man bowed deeply and went out trembling, but without speaking a
\par word.

\par CHAPTER XII--THE CHEST OPENED
\par 
\par 
\par Left alone in the turret-room, Edgar Caswall carefully locked the door
\par and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole.  Next, he inspected the
\par windows, and saw that they were not overlooked from any angle of the main
\par building.  Then he carefully examined the trunk, going over it with a
\par magnifying glass.  He found it intact: the steel bands were flawless; the
\par whole trunk was compact.  After sitting opposite to it for some time, and
\par the shades of evening beginning to melt into darkness, he gave up the
\par task and went to his bedroom, after locking the door of the turret-room
\par behind him and taking away the key.
\par 
\par He woke in the morning at daylight, and resumed his patient but
\par unavailing study of the metal trunk.  This he continued during the whole
\par day with the same result--humiliating disappointment, which overwrought
\par his nerves and made his head ache.  The result of the long strain was
\par seen later in the afternoon, when he sat locked within the turret-room
\par before the still baffling trunk, distrait, listless and yet agitated,
\par sunk in a settled gloom.  As the dusk was falling he told the steward to
\par send him two men, strong ones.  These he ordered to take the trunk to his
\par bedroom.  In that room he then sat on into the night, without pausing
\par even to take any food.  His mind was in a whirl, a fever of excitement.
\par The result was that when, late in the night, he locked himself in his
\par room his brain was full of odd fancies; he was on the high road to mental
\par disturbance.  He lay down on his bed in the dark, still brooding over the
\par mystery of the closed trunk.
\par 
\par Gradually he yielded to the influences of silence and darkness.  After
\par lying there quietly for some time, his mind became active again.  But
\par this time there were round him no disturbing influences; his brain was
\par active and able to work freely and to deal with memory.  A thousand
\par forgotten--or only half-known--incidents, fragments of conversations or
\par theories long ago guessed at and long forgotten, crowded on his mind.  He
\par seemed to hear again around him the legions of whirring wings to which he
\par had been so lately accustomed.  Even to himself he knew that that was an
\par effort of imagination founded on imperfect memory.  But he was content
\par that imagination should work, for out of it might come some solution of
\par the mystery which surrounded him.  And in this frame of mind, sleep made
\par another and more successful essay.  This time he enjoyed peaceful
\par slumber, restful alike to his wearied body and his overwrought brain.
\par 
\par In his sleep he arose, and, as if in obedience to some influence beyond
\par and greater than himself, lifted the great trunk and set it on a strong
\par table at one side of the room, from which he had previously removed a
\par quantity of books.  To do this, he had to use an amount of strength which
\par was, he knew, far beyond him in his normal state.  As it was, it seemed
\par easy enough; everything yielded before his touch.  Then he became
\par conscious that somehow--how, he never could remember--the chest was open.
\par He unlocked his door, and, taking the chest on his shoulder, carried it
\par up to the turret-room, the door of which also he unlocked.  Even at the
\par time he was amazed at his own strength, and wondered whence it had come.
\par His mind, lost in conjecture, was too far off to realise more immediate
\par things.  He knew that the chest was enormously heavy.  He seemed, in a
\par sort of vision which lit up the absolute blackness around, to see the two
\par sturdy servant men staggering under its great weight.  He locked himself
\par again in the turret-room, and laid the opened chest on a table, and in
\par the darkness began to unpack it, laying out the contents, which were
\par mainly of metal and glass--great pieces in strange forms--on another
\par table.  He was conscious of being still asleep, and of acting rather in
\par obedience to some unseen and unknown command than in accordance with any
\par reasonable plan, to be followed by results which he understood.  This
\par phase completed, he proceeded to arrange in order the component parts of
\par some large instruments, formed mostly of glass.  His fingers seemed to
\par have acquired a new and exquisite subtlety and even a volition of their
\par own.  Then weariness of brain came upon him; his head sank down on his
\par breast, and little by little everything became wrapped in gloom.
\par 
\par He awoke in the early morning in his bedroom, and looked around him, now
\par clear-headed, in amazement.  In its usual place on the strong table stood
\par the great steel-hooped chest without lock or key.  But it was now locked.
\par He arose quietly and stole to the turret-room.  There everything was as
\par it had been on the previous evening.  He looked out of the window where
\par high in air flew, as usual, the giant kite.  He unlocked the wicket gate
\par of the turret stair and went out on the roof.  Close to him was the great
\par coil of cord on its reel.  It was humming in the morning breeze, and when
\par he touched the string it sent a quick thrill through hand and arm.  There
\par was no sign anywhere that there had been any disturbance or displacement
\par of anything during the night.
\par 
\par Utterly bewildered, he sat down in his room to think.  Now for the first
\par time he _felt_ that he was asleep and dreaming.  Presently he fell asleep
\par again, and slept for a long time.  He awoke hungry and made a hearty
\par meal.  Then towards evening, having locked himself in, he fell asleep
\par again.  When he woke he was in darkness, and was quite at sea as to his
\par whereabouts.  He began feeling about the dark room, and was recalled to
\par the consequences of his position by the breaking of a large piece of
\par glass.  Having obtained a light, he discovered this to be a glass wheel,
\par part of an elaborate piece of mechanism which he must in his sleep have
\par taken from the chest, which was now opened.  He had once again opened it
\par whilst asleep, but he had no recollection of the circumstances.
\par 
\par Caswall came to the conclusion that there had been some sort of dual
\par action of his mind, which might lead to some catastrophe or some
\par discovery of his secret plans; so he resolved to forgo for a while the
\par pleasure of making discoveries regarding the chest.  To this end, he
\par applied himself to quite another matter--an investigation of the other
\par treasures and rare objects in his collections.  He went amongst them in
\par simple, idle curiosity, his main object being to discover some strange
\par item which he might use for experiment with the kite.  He had already
\par resolved to try some runners other than those made of paper.  He had a
\par vague idea that with such a force as the great kite straining at its
\par leash, this might be used to lift to the altitude of the kite itself
\par heavier articles.  His first experiment with articles of little but
\par increasing weight was eminently successful.  So he added by degrees more
\par and more weight, until he found out that the lifting power of the kite
\par was considerable.  He then determined to take a step further, and send to
\par the kite some of the articles which lay in the steel-hooped chest.  The
\par last time he had opened it in sleep, it had not been shut again, and he
\par had inserted a wedge so that he could open it at will.  He made
\par examination of the contents, but came to the conclusion that the glass
\par objects were unsuitable.  They were too light for testing weight, and
\par they were so frail as to be dangerous to send to such a height.
\par 
\par So he looked around for something more solid with which to experiment.
\par His eye caught sight of an object which at once attracted him.  This was
\par a small copy of one of the ancient Egyptian gods--that of Bes, who
\par represented the destructive power of nature.  It was so bizarre and
\par mysterious as to commend itself to his mad humour.  In lifting it from
\par the cabinet, he was struck by its great weight in proportion to its size.
\par He made accurate examination of it by the aid of some instruments, and
\par came to the conclusion that it was carved from a lump of lodestone.  He
\par remembered that he had read somewhere of an ancient Egyptian god cut from
\par a similar substance, and, thinking it over, he came to the conclusion
\par that he must have read it in Sir Thomas Brown's _Popular Errors_, a book
\par of the seventeenth century.  He got the book from the library, and looked
\par out the passage:
\par 
\par "A great example we have from the observation of our learned friend Mr.
\par Graves, in an AEgyptian idol cut out of Loadstone and found among the
\par Mummies; which still retains its attraction, though probably taken out of
\par the mine about two thousand years ago."
\par 
\par The strangeness of the figure, and its being so close akin to his own
\par nature, attracted him.  He made from thin wood a large circular runner,
\par and in front of it placed the weighty god, sending it up to the flying
\par kite along the throbbing cord.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XIII--OOLANGA'S HALLUCINATIONS
\par 
\par 
\par During the last few days Lady Arabella had been getting exceedingly
\par impatient.  Her debts, always pressing, were growing to an embarrassing
\par amount.  The only hope she had of comfort in life was a good marriage;
\par but the good marriage on which she had fixed her eye did not seem to move
\par quickly enough--indeed, it did not seem to move at all--in the right
\par direction.  Edgar Caswall was not an ardent wooer.  From the very first
\par he seemed _difficile_, but he had been keeping to his own room ever since
\par his struggle with Mimi Watford.  On that occasion Lady Arabella had shown
\par him in an unmistakable way what her feelings were; indeed, she had made
\par it known to him, in a more overt way than pride should allow, that she
\par wished to help and support him.  The moment when she had gone across the
\par room to stand beside him in his mesmeric struggle, had been the very
\par limit of her voluntary action.  It was quite bitter enough, she felt,
\par that he did not come to her, but now that she had made that advance, she
\par felt that any withdrawal on his part would, to a woman of her class, be
\par nothing less than a flaming insult.  Had she not classed herself with his
\par nigger servant, an unreformed savage?  Had she not shown her preference
\par for him at the festival of his home-coming?  Had she not . . . Lady
\par Arabella was cold-blooded, and she was prepared to go through all that
\par might be necessary of indifference, and even insult, to become chatelaine
\par of Castra Regis.  In the meantime, she would show no hurry--she must
\par wait.  She might, in an unostentatious way, come to him again.  She knew
\par him now, and could make a keen guess at his desires with regard to Lilla
\par Watford.  With that secret in her possession, she could bring pressure to
\par bear on Caswall which would make it no easy matter for him to evade her.
\par The great difficulty was how to get near him.  He was shut up within his
\par Castle, and guarded by a defence of convention which she could not pass
\par without danger of ill repute to herself.  Over this question she thought
\par and thought for days and nights.  At last she decided that the only way
\par would be to go to him openly at Castra Regis.  Her rank and position
\par would make such a thing possible, if carefully done.  She could explain
\par matters afterwards if necessary.  Then when they were alone, she would
\par use her arts and her experience to make him commit himself.  After all,
\par he was only a man, with a man's dislike of difficult or awkward
\par situations.  She felt quite sufficient confidence in her own womanhood to
\par carry her through any difficulty which might arise.
\par 
\par From Diana's Grove she heard each day the luncheon-gong from Castra Regis
\par sound, and knew the hour when the servants would be in the back of the
\par house.  She would enter the house at that hour, and, pretending that she
\par could not make anyone hear her, would seek him in his own rooms.  The
\par tower was, she knew, away from all the usual sounds of the house, and
\par moreover she knew that the servants had strict orders not to interrupt
\par him when he was in the turret chamber.  She had found out, partly by the
\par aid of an opera-glass and partly by judicious questioning, that several
\par times lately a heavy chest had been carried to and from his room, and
\par that it rested in the room each night.  She was, therefore, confident
\par that he had some important work on hand which would keep him busy for
\par long spells.
\par 
\par Meanwhile, another member of the household at Castra Regis had schemes
\par which he thought were working to fruition.  A man in the position of a
\par servant has plenty of opportunity of watching his betters and forming
\par opinions regarding them.  Oolanga was in his way a clever, unscrupulous
\par rogue, and he felt that with things moving round him in this great
\par household there should be opportunities of self-advancement.  Being
\par unscrupulous and stealthy--and a savage--he looked to dishonest means.  He
\par saw plainly enough that Lady Arabella was making a dead set at his
\par master, and he was watchful of the slightest sign of anything which might
\par enhance this knowledge.  Like the other men in the house, he knew of the
\par carrying to and fro of the great chest, and had got it into his head that
\par the care exercised in its porterage indicated that it was full of
\par treasure.  He was for ever lurking around the turret-rooms on the chance
\par of making some useful discovery.  But he was as cautious as he was
\par stealthy, and took care that no one else watched him.
\par 
\par It was thus that the negro became aware of Lady Arabella's venture into
\par the house, as she thought, unseen.  He took more care than ever, since he
\par was watching another, that the positions were not reversed.  More than
\par ever he kept his eyes and ears open and his mouth shut.  Seeing Lady
\par Arabella gliding up the stairs towards his master's room, he took it for
\par granted that she was there for no good, and doubled his watching
\par intentness and caution.
\par 
\par Oolanga was disappointed, but he dared not exhibit any feeling lest it
\par should betray that he was hiding.  Therefore he slunk downstairs again
\par noiselessly, and waited for a more favourable opportunity of furthering
\par his plans.  It must be borne in mind that he thought that the heavy trunk
\par was full of valuables, and that he believed that Lady Arabella had come
\par to try to steal it.  His purpose of using for his own advantage the
\par combination of these two ideas was seen later in the day.  Oolanga
\par secretly followed her home.  He was an expert at this game, and succeeded
\par admirably on this occasion.  He watched her enter the private gate of
\par Diana's Grove, and then, taking a roundabout course and keeping out of
\par her sight, he at last overtook her in a thick part of the Grove where no
\par one could see the meeting.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella was much surprised.  She had not seen the negro for several
\par days, and had almost forgotten his existence.  Oolanga would have been
\par startled had he known and been capable of understanding the real value
\par placed on him, his beauty, his worthiness, by other persons, and compared
\par it with the value in these matters in which he held himself.  Doubtless
\par Oolanga had his dreams like other men.  In such cases he saw himself as a
\par young sun-god, as beautiful as the eye of dusky or even white womanhood
\par had ever dwelt upon.  He would have been filled with all noble and
\par captivating qualities--or those regarded as such in West Africa.  Women
\par would have loved him, and would have told him so in the overt and fervid
\par manner usual in affairs of the heart in the shadowy depths of the forest
\par of the Gold Coast.
\par 
\par Oolanga came close behind Lady Arabella, and in a hushed voice, suitable
\par to the importance of his task, and in deference to the respect he had for
\par her and the place, began to unfold the story of his love.  Lady Arabella
\par was not usually a humorous person, but no man or woman of the white race
\par could have checked the laughter which rose spontaneously to her lips.  The
\par circumstances were too grotesque, the contrast too violent, for subdued
\par mirth.  The man a debased specimen of one of the most primitive races of
\par the earth, and of an ugliness which was simply devilish; the woman of
\par high degree, beautiful, accomplished.  She thought that her first
\par moment's consideration of the outrage--it was nothing less in her
\par eyes--had given her the full material for thought.  But every instant
\par after threw new and varied lights on the affront.  Her indignation was
\par too great for passion; only irony or satire would meet the situation.  Her
\par cold, cruel nature helped, and she did not shrink to subject this
\par ignorant savage to the merciless fire-lash of her scorn.
\par 
\par Oolanga was dimly conscious that he was being flouted; but his anger was
\par no less keen because of the measure of his ignorance.  So he gave way to
\par it, as does a tortured beast.  He ground his great teeth together, raved,
\par stamped, and swore in barbarous tongues and with barbarous imagery.  Even
\par Lady Arabella felt that it was well she was within reach of help, or he
\par might have offered her brutal violence--even have killed her.
\par 
\par "Am I to understand," she said with cold disdain, so much more effective
\par to wound than hot passion, "that you are offering me your love?
\par Your--love?"
\par 
\par For reply he nodded his head.  The scorn of her voice, in a sort of
\par baleful hiss, sounded--and felt--like the lash of a whip.
\par 
\par "And you dared! you--a savage--a slave--the basest thing in the world of
\par vermin!  Take care!  I don't value your worthless life more than I do
\par that of a rat or a spider.  Don't let me ever see your hideous face here
\par again, or I shall rid the earth of you."
\par 
\par As she was speaking, she had taken out her revolver and was pointing it
\par at him.  In the immediate presence of death his impudence forsook him,
\par and he made a weak effort to justify himself.  His speech was short,
\par consisting of single words.  To Lady Arabella it sounded mere gibberish,
\par but it was in his own dialect, and meant love, marriage, wife.  From the
\par intonation of the words, she guessed, with her woman's quick intuition,
\par at their meaning; but she quite failed to follow, when, becoming more
\par pressing, he continued to urge his suit in a mixture of the grossest
\par animal passion and ridiculous threats.  He warned her that he knew she
\par had tried to steal his master's treasure, and that he had caught her in
\par the act.  But if she would be his, he would share the treasure with her,
\par and they could live in luxury in the African forests.  But if she
\par refused, he would tell his master, who would flog and torture her and
\par then give her to the police, who would kill her.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XIV--BATTLE RENEWED
\par 
\par 
\par The consequences of that meeting in the dusk of Diana's Grove were acute
\par and far-reaching, and not only to the two engaged in it.  From Oolanga,
\par this might have been expected by anyone who knew the character of the
\par tropical African savage.  To such, there are two passions that are
\par inexhaustible and insatiable--vanity and that which they are pleased to
\par call love.  Oolanga left the Grove with an absorbing hatred in his heart.
\par His lust and greed were afire, while his vanity had been wounded to the
\par core.  Lady Arabella's icy nature was not so deeply stirred, though she
\par was in a seething passion.  More than ever she was set upon bringing
\par Edgar Caswall to her feet.  The obstacles she had encountered, the
\par insults she had endured, were only as fuel to the purpose of revenge
\par which consumed her.
\par 
\par As she sought her own rooms in Diana's Grove, she went over the whole
\par subject again and again, always finding in the face of Lilla Watford a
\par key to a problem which puzzled her--the problem of a way to turn
\par Caswall's powers--his very existence--to aid her purpose.
\par 
\par When in her boudoir, she wrote a note, taking so much trouble over it
\par that she destroyed, and rewrote, till her dainty waste-basket was half-
\par full of torn sheets of notepaper.  When quite satisfied, she copied out
\par the last sheet afresh, and then carefully burned all the spoiled
\par fragments.  She put the copied note in an emblazoned envelope, and
\par directed it to Edgar Caswall at Castra Regis.  This she sent off by one
\par of her grooms.  The letter ran:
\par 
\par    "DEAR MR. CASWALL,
\par 
\par    "I want to have a chat with you on a subject in which I believe you
\par    are interested.  Will you kindly call for me one day after lunch--say
\par    at three or four o'clock, and we can walk a little way together.  Only
\par    as far as Mercy Farm, where I want to see Lilla and Mimi Watford.  We
\par    can take a cup of tea at the Farm.  Do not bring your African servant
\par    with you, as I am afraid his face frightens the girls.  After all, he
\par    is not pretty, is he?  I have an idea you will be pleased with your
\par    visit this time.
\par 
\par    "Yours sincerely,
\par 
\par    "ARABELLA MARCH."
\par 
\par At half-past three next day, Edgar Caswall called at Diana's Grove.  Lady
\par Arabella met him on the roadway outside the gate.  She wished to take the
\par servants into her confidence as little as possible.  She turned when she
\par saw him coming, and walked beside him towards Mercy Farm, keeping step
\par with him as they walked.  When they got near Mercy, she turned and looked
\par around her, expecting to see Oolanga or some sign of him.  He was,
\par however, not visible.  He had received from his master peremptory orders
\par to keep out of sight--an order for which the African scored a new offence
\par up against her.  They found Lilla and Mimi at home and seemingly glad to
\par see them, though both the girls were surprised at the visit coming so
\par soon after the other.
\par 
\par The proceedings were a repetition of the battle of souls of the former
\par visit.  On this occasion, however, Edgar Caswall had only the presence of
\par Lady Arabella to support him--Oolanga being absent; but Mimi lacked the
\par support of Adam Salton, which had been of such effective service before.
\par This time the struggle for supremacy of will was longer and more
\par determined.  Caswall felt that if he could not achieve supremacy he had
\par better give up the idea, so all his pride was enlisted against Mimi.  When
\par they had been waiting for the door to be opened, Lady Arabella, believing
\par in a sudden attack, had said to him in a low voice, which somehow carried
\par conviction:
\par 
\par "This time you should win.  Mimi is, after all, only a woman.  Show her
\par no mercy.  That is weakness.  Fight her, beat her, trample on her--kill
\par her if need be.  She stands in your way, and I hate her.  Never take your
\par eyes off her.  Never mind Lilla--she is afraid of you.  You are already
\par her master.  Mimi will try to make you look at her cousin.  There lies
\par defeat.  Let nothing take your attention from Mimi, and you will win.  If
\par she is overcoming you, take my hand and hold it hard whilst you are
\par looking into her eyes.  If she is too strong for you, I shall interfere.
\par I'll make a diversion, and under cover of it you must retire unbeaten,
\par even if not victorious.  Hush! they are coming."
\par 
\par The two girls came to the door together.  Strange sounds were coming up
\par over the Brow from the west.  It was the rustling and crackling of the
\par dry reeds and rushes from the low lands.  The season had been an
\par unusually dry one.  Also the strong east wind was helping forward
\par enormous flocks of birds, most of them pigeons with white cowls.  Not
\par only were their wings whirring, but their cooing was plainly audible.
\par From such a multitude of birds the mass of sound, individually small,
\par assumed the volume of a storm.  Surprised at the influx of birds, to
\par which they had been strangers so long, they all looked towards Castra
\par Regis, from whose high tower the great kite had been flying as usual.  But
\par even as they looked, the cord broke, and the great kite fell headlong in
\par a series of sweeping dives.  Its own weight, and the aerial force opposed
\par to it, which caused it to rise, combined with the strong easterly breeze,
\par had been too much for the great length of cord holding it.
\par 
\par Somehow, the mishap to the kite gave new hope to Mimi.  It was as though
\par the side issues had been shorn away, so that the main struggle was
\par thenceforth on simpler lines.  She had a feeling in her heart, as though
\par some religious chord had been newly touched.  It may, of course, have
\par been that with the renewal of the bird voices a fresh courage, a fresh
\par belief in the good issue of the struggle came too.  In the misery of
\par silence, from which they had all suffered for so long, any new train of
\par thought was almost bound to be a boon.  As the inrush of birds continued,
\par their wings beating against the crackling rushes, Lady Arabella grew
\par pale, and almost fainted.
\par 
\par "What is that?" she asked suddenly.
\par 
\par To Mimi, born and bred in Siam, the sound was strangely like an
\par exaggeration of the sound produced by a snake-charmer.
\par 
\par Edgar Caswall was the first to recover from the interruption of the
\par falling kite.  After a few minutes he seemed to have quite recovered his
\par _sang froid_, and was able to use his brains to the end which he had in
\par view.  Mimi too quickly recovered herself, but from a different cause.
\par With her it was a deep religious conviction that the struggle round her
\par was of the powers of Good and Evil, and that Good was triumphing.  The
\par very appearance of the snowy birds, with the cowls of Saint Columba,
\par heightened the impression.  With this conviction strong upon her, she
\par continued the strange battle with fresh vigour.  She seemed to tower over
\par Caswall, and he to give back before her oncoming.  Once again her
\par vigorous passes drove him to the door.  He was just going out backward
\par when Lady Arabella, who had been gazing at him with fixed eyes, caught
\par his hand and tried to stop his movement.  She was, however, unable to do
\par any good, and so, holding hands, they passed out together.  As they did
\par so, the strange music which had so alarmed Lady Arabella suddenly
\par stopped.  Instinctively they all looked towards the tower of Castra
\par Regis, and saw that the workmen had refixed the kite, which had risen
\par again and was beginning to float out to its former station.
\par 
\par As they were looking, the door opened and Michael Watford came into the
\par room.  By that time all had recovered their self-possession, and there
\par was nothing out of the common to attract his attention.  As he came in,
\par seeing inquiring looks all around him, he said:
\par 
\par "The new influx of birds is only the annual migration of pigeons from
\par Africa.  I am told that it will soon be over."
\par 
\par The second victory of Mimi Watford made Edgar Caswall more moody than
\par ever.  He felt thrown back on himself, and this, added to his absorbing
\par interest in the hope of a victory of his mesmeric powers, became a deep
\par and settled purpose of revenge.  The chief object of his animosity was,
\par of course, Mimi, whose will had overcome his, but it was obscured in
\par greater or lesser degree by all who had opposed him.  Lilla was next to
\par Mimi in his hate--Lilla, the harmless, tender-hearted, sweet-natured
\par girl, whose heart was so full of love for all things that in it was no
\par room for the passions of ordinary life--whose nature resembled those
\par doves of St. Columba, whose colour she wore, whose appearance she
\par reflected.  Adam Salton came next--after a gap; for against him Caswall
\par had no direct animosity.  He regarded him as an interference, a
\par difficulty to be got rid of or destroyed.  The young Australian had been
\par so discreet that the most he had against him was his knowledge of what
\par had been.  Caswall did not understand him, and to such a nature as his,
\par ignorance was a cause of alarm, of dread.
\par 
\par Caswall resumed his habit of watching the great kite straining at its
\par cord, varying his vigils in this way by a further examination of the
\par mysterious treasures of his house, especially Mesmer's chest.  He sat
\par much on the roof of the tower, brooding over his thwarted passion.  The
\par vast extent of his possessions, visible to him at that altitude, might,
\par one would have thought, have restored some of his complacency.  But the
\par very extent of his ownership, thus perpetually brought before him,
\par created a fresh sense of grievance.  How was it, he thought, that with so
\par much at command that others wished for, he could not achieve the dearest
\par wishes of his heart?
\par 
\par In this state of intellectual and moral depravity, he found a solace in
\par the renewal of his experiments with the mechanical powers of the kite.
\par For a couple of weeks he did not see Lady Arabella, who was always on the
\par watch for a chance of meeting him; neither did he see the Watford girls,
\par who studiously kept out of his way.  Adam Salton simply marked time,
\par keeping ready to deal with anything that might affect his friends.  He
\par called at the farm and heard from Mimi of the last battle of wills, but
\par it had only one consequence.  He got from Ross several more mongooses,
\par including a second king-cobra-killer, which he generally carried with him
\par in its box whenever he walked out.
\par 
\par Mr. Caswall's experiments with the kite went on successfully.  Each day
\par he tried the lifting of greater weight, and it seemed almost as if the
\par machine had a sentience of its own, which was increasing with the
\par obstacles placed before it.  All this time the kite hung in the sky at an
\par enormous height.  The wind was steadily from the north, so the trend of
\par the kite was to the south.  All day long, runners of increasing magnitude
\par were sent up.  These were only of paper or thin cardboard, or leather, or
\par other flexible materials.  The great height at which the kite hung made a
\par great concave curve in the string, so that as the runners went up they
\par made a flapping sound.  If one laid a finger on the string, the sound
\par answered to the flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent
\par murmur.  Edgar Caswall, who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all
\par belonging to it, found a distinct resemblance between that intermittent
\par rumble and the snake-charming music produced by the pigeons flying
\par through the dry reeds.
\par 
\par One day he made a discovery in Mesmer's chest which he thought he would
\par utilise with regard to the runners.  This was a great length of wire,
\par "fine as human hair," coiled round a finely made wheel, which ran to a
\par wondrous distance freely, and as lightly.  He tried this on runners, and
\par found it work admirably.  Whether the runner was alone, or carried
\par something much more weighty than itself, it worked equally well.  Also it
\par was strong enough and light enough to draw back the runner without undue
\par strain.  He tried this a good many times successfully, but it was now
\par growing dusk and he found some difficulty in keeping the runner in sight.
\par So he looked for something heavy enough to keep it still.  He placed the
\par Egyptian image of Bes on the fine wire, which crossed the wooden ledge
\par which protected it.  Then, the darkness growing, he went indoors and
\par forgot all about it.
\par 
\par He had a strange feeling of uneasiness that night--not sleeplessness, for
\par he seemed conscious of being asleep.  At daylight he rose, and as usual
\par looked out for the kite.  He did not see it in its usual position in the
\par sky, so looked round the points of the compass.  He was more than
\par astonished when presently he saw the missing kite struggling as usual
\par against the controlling cord.  But it had gone to the further side of the
\par tower, and now hung and strained _against the wind_ to the north.  He
\par thought it so strange that he determined to investigate the phenomenon,
\par and to say nothing about it in the meantime.
\par 
\par In his many travels, Edgar Caswall had been accustomed to use the
\par sextant, and was now an expert in the matter.  By the aid of this and
\par other instruments, he was able to fix the position of the kite and the
\par point over which it hung.  He was startled to find that exactly under
\par it--so far as he could ascertain--was Diana's Grove.  He had an
\par inclination to take Lady Arabella into his confidence in the matter, but
\par he thought better of it and wisely refrained.  For some reason which he
\par did not try to explain to himself, he was glad of his silence, when, on
\par the following morning, he found, on looking out, that the point over
\par which the kite then hovered was Mercy Farm.  When he had verified this
\par with his instruments, he sat before the window of the tower, looking out
\par and thinking.  The new locality was more to his liking than the other;
\par but the why of it puzzled him, all the same.  He spent the rest of the
\par day in the turret-room, which he did not leave all day.  It seemed to him
\par that he was now drawn by forces which he could not control--of which,
\par indeed, he had no knowledge--in directions which he did not understand,
\par and which were without his own volition.  In sheer helpless inability to
\par think the problem out satisfactorily, he called up a servant and told him
\par to tell Oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turret-room.  The
\par answer came back that the African had not been seen since the previous
\par evening.
\par 
\par Caswall was now so irritable that even this small thing upset him.  As he
\par was distrait and wanted to talk to somebody, he sent for Simon Chester,
\par who came at once, breathless with hurrying and upset by the unexpected
\par summons.  Caswall bade him sit down, and when the old man was in a less
\par uneasy frame of mind, he again asked him if he had ever seen what was in
\par Mesmer's chest or heard it spoken about.
\par 
\par Chester admitted that he had once, in the time of "the then Mr. Edgar,"
\par seen the chest open, which, knowing something of its history and guessing
\par more, so upset him that he had fainted.  When he recovered, the chest was
\par closed.  From that time the then Mr. Edgar had never spoken about it
\par again.
\par 
\par When Caswall asked him to describe what he had seen when the chest was
\par open, he got very agitated, and, despite all his efforts to remain calm,
\par he suddenly went off into a faint.  Caswall summoned servants, who
\par applied the usual remedies.  Still the old man did not recover.  After
\par the lapse of a considerable time, the doctor who had been summoned made
\par his appearance.  A glance was sufficient for him to make up his mind.
\par Still, he knelt down by the old man, and made a careful examination.  Then
\par he rose to his feet, and in a hushed voice said:
\par 
\par "I grieve to say, sir, that he has passed away."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XV--ON THE TRACK
\par 
\par 
\par Those who had seen Edgar Caswall familiarly since his arrival, and had
\par already estimated his cold-blooded nature at something of its true value,
\par were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old Chester.  The
\par fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at his character.
\par They thought, naturally enough, that the concern which he felt was that
\par of a master for a faithful old servant of his family.  They little
\par thought that it was merely the selfish expression of his disappointment,
\par that he had thus lost the only remaining clue to an interesting piece of
\par family history--one which was now and would be for ever wrapped in
\par mystery.  Caswall knew enough about the life of his ancestor in Paris to
\par wish to know more fully and more thoroughly all that had been.  The
\par period covered by that ancestor's life in Paris was one inviting every
\par form of curiosity.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella, who had her own game to play, saw in the _metier_ of
\par sympathetic friend, a series of meetings with the man she wanted to
\par secure.  She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old
\par Chester's death; indeed, as soon as the news had filtered in through the
\par back door of Diana's Grove.  At that meeting, she played her part so well
\par that even Caswall's cold nature was impressed.
\par 
\par Oolanga was the only one who did not credit her with at least some sense
\par of fine feeling in the matter.  In emotional, as in other matters,
\par Oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian, and as he could not understand
\par anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering, pain, or for the loss
\par of money, he could not understand anyone simulating such an emotion
\par except for show intended to deceive.  He thought that she had come to
\par Castra Regis again for the opportunity of stealing something, and was
\par determined that on this occasion the chance of pressing his advantage
\par over her should not pass.  He felt, therefore, that the occasion was one
\par for extra carefulness in the watching of all that went on.  Ever since he
\par had come to the conclusion that Lady Arabella was trying to steal the
\par treasure-chest, he suspected nearly everyone of the same design, and made
\par it a point to watch all suspicious persons and places.  As Adam was
\par engaged on his own researches regarding Lady Arabella, it was only
\par natural that there should be some crossing of each other's tracks.  This
\par is what did actually happen.
\par 
\par Adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he was
\par interested, taking with him the mongoose in its box.  He arrived at the
\par gate of Diana's Grove just as Lady Arabella was preparing to set out for
\par Castra Regis on what she considered her mission of comfort.  Seeing Adam
\par from her window going through the shadows of the trees round the gate,
\par she thought that he must be engaged on some purpose similar to her own.
\par So, quickly making her toilet, she quietly left the house, and, taking
\par advantage of every shadow and substance which could hide her, followed
\par him on his walk.
\par 
\par Oolanga, the experienced tracker, followed her, but succeeded in hiding
\par his movements better than she did.  He saw that Adam had on his shoulder
\par a mysterious box, which he took to contain something valuable.  Seeing
\par that Lady Arabella was secretly following Adam, he was confirmed in this
\par idea.  His mind--such as it was--was fixed on her trying to steal, and he
\par credited her at once with making use of this new opportunity.
\par 
\par In his walk, Adam went into the grounds of Castra Regis, and Oolanga saw
\par her follow him with great secrecy.  He feared to go closer, as now on
\par both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery.  When he
\par realised that Lady Arabella was bound for the Castle, he devoted himself
\par to following her with singleness of purpose.  He therefore missed seeing
\par that Adam branched off the track and returned to the high road.
\par 
\par That night Edgar Caswall had slept badly.  The tragic occurrence of the
\par day was on his mind, and he kept waking and thinking of it.  After an
\par early breakfast, he sat at the open window watching the kite and thinking
\par of many things.  From his room he could see all round the neighbourhood,
\par but the two places that interested him most were Mercy Farm and Diana's
\par Grove.  At first the movements about those spots were of a humble
\par kind--those that belong to domestic service or agricultural needs--the
\par opening of doors and windows, the sweeping and brushing, and generally
\par the restoration of habitual order.
\par 
\par From his high window--whose height made it a screen from the observation
\par of others--he saw the chain of watchers move into his own grounds, and
\par then presently break up--Adam Salton going one way, and Lady Arabella,
\par followed by the nigger, another.  Then Oolanga disappeared amongst the
\par trees; but Caswall could see that he was still watching.  Lady Arabella,
\par after looking around her, slipped in by the open door, and he could, of
\par course, see her no longer.
\par 
\par Presently, however, he heard a light tap at his door, then the door
\par opened slowly, and he could see the flash of Lady Arabella's white dress
\par through the opening.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XVI--A VISIT OF SYMPATHY
\par 
\par 
\par Caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw Lady Arabella, though he need
\par not have been, after what had already occurred in the same way.  The look
\par of surprise on his face was so much greater than Lady Arabella had
\par expected--though she thought she was prepared to meet anything that might
\par occur--that she stood still, in sheer amazement.  Cold-blooded as she was
\par and ready for all social emergencies, she was nonplussed how to go on.
\par She was plucky, however, and began to speak at once, although she had not
\par the slightest idea what she was going to say.
\par 
\par "I came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have so
\par lately experienced."
\par 
\par "My grief?  I'm afraid I must be very dull; but I really do not
\par understand."
\par 
\par Already she felt at a disadvantage, and hesitated.
\par 
\par "I mean about the old man who died so suddenly--your old . . . retainer."
\par 
\par Caswall's face relaxed something of its puzzled concentration.
\par 
\par "Oh, he was only a servant; and he had over-stayed his three-score and
\par ten years by something like twenty years.  He must have been ninety!"
\par 
\par "Still, as an old servant . . . "
\par 
\par Caswall's words were not so cold as their inflection.
\par 
\par "I never interfere with servants.  He was kept on here merely because he
\par had been so long on the premises.  I suppose the steward thought it might
\par make him unpopular if the old fellow had been dismissed."
\par 
\par How on earth was she to proceed on such a task as hers if this was the
\par utmost geniality she could expect?  So she at once tried another
\par tack--this time a personal one.
\par 
\par "I am sorry I disturbed you.  I am really not unconventional--though
\par certainly no slave to convention.  Still there are limits . . . it is bad
\par enough to intrude in this way, and I do not know what you can say or
\par think of the time selected, for the intrusion."
\par 
\par After all, Edgar Caswall was a gentleman by custom and habit, so he rose
\par to the occasion.
\par 
\par "I can only say, Lady Arabella, that you are always welcome at any time
\par you may deign to honour my house with your presence."
\par 
\par She smiled at him sweetly.
\par 
\par "Thank you _so_ much.  You _do_ put one at ease.  My breach of convention
\par makes me glad rather than sorry.  I feel that I can open my heart to you
\par about anything."
\par 
\par Forthwith she proceeded to tell him about Oolanga and his strange
\par suspicions of her honesty.  Caswall laughed and made her explain all the
\par details.  His final comment was enlightening.
\par 
\par "Let me give you a word of advice: If you have the slightest fault to
\par find with that infernal nigger, shoot him at sight.  A swelled-headed
\par nigger, with a bee in his bonnet, is one of the worst difficulties in the
\par world to deal with.  So better make a clean job of it, and wipe him out
\par at once!"
\par 
\par "But what about the law, Mr. Caswall?"
\par 
\par "Oh, the law doesn't concern itself much about dead niggers.  A few more
\par or less do not matter.  To my mind it's rather a relief!"
\par 
\par "I'm afraid of you," was her only comment, made with a sweet smile and in
\par a soft voice.
\par 
\par "All right," he said, "let us leave it at that.  Anyhow, we shall be rid
\par of one of them!"
\par 
\par "I don't love niggers any more than you do," she replied, "and I suppose
\par one mustn't be too particular where that sort of cleaning up is
\par concerned."  Then she changed in voice and manner, and asked genially:
\par "And now tell me, am I forgiven?"
\par 
\par "You are, dear lady--if there is anything to forgive."
\par 
\par As he spoke, seeing that she had moved to go, he came to the door with
\par her, and in the most natural way accompanied her downstairs.  He passed
\par through the hall with her and down the avenue.  As he went back to the
\par house, she smiled to herself.
\par 
\par "Well, that is all right.  I don't think the morning has been altogether
\par thrown away."
\par 
\par And she walked slowly back to Diana's Grove.
\par 
\par Adam Salton followed the line of the Brow, and refreshed his memory as to
\par the various localities.  He got home to Lesser Hill just as Sir Nathaniel
\par was beginning lunch.  Mr. Salton had gone to Walsall to keep an early
\par appointment; so he was all alone.  When the meal was over--seeing in
\par Adam's face that he had something to speak about--he followed into the
\par study and shut the door.
\par 
\par When the two men had lighted their pipes, Sir Nathaniel began.
\par 
\par "I have remembered an interesting fact about Diana's Grove--there is, I
\par have long understood, some strange mystery about that house.  It may be
\par of some interest, or it may be trivial, in such a tangled skein as we are
\par trying to unravel."
\par 
\par "Please tell me all you know or suspect.  To begin, then, of what sort
\par is the mystery--physical, mental, moral, historical, scientific, occult?
\par Any kind of hint will help me."
\par 
\par "Quite right.  I shall try to tell you what I think; but I have not put
\par my thoughts on the subject in sequence, so you must forgive me if due
\par order is not observed in my narration.  I suppose you have seen the house
\par at Diana's Grove?"
\par 
\par "The outside of it; but I have that in my mind's eye, and I can fit into
\par my memory whatever you may mention."
\par 
\par "The house is very old--probably the first house of some sort that stood
\par there was in the time of the Romans.  This was probably renewed--perhaps
\par several times at later periods.  The house stands, or, rather, used to
\par stand here when Mercia was a kingdom--I do not suppose that the basement
\par can be later than the Norman Conquest.  Some years ago, when I was
\par President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I went all over it very
\par carefully.  This was when it was purchased by Captain March.  The house
\par had then been done up, so as to be suitable for the bride.  The basement
\par is very strong,--almost as strong and as heavy as if it had been intended
\par as a fortress.  There are a whole series of rooms deep underground.  One
\par of them in particular struck me.  The room itself is of considerable
\par size, but the masonry is more than massive.  In the middle of the room is
\par a sunk well, built up to floor level and evidently going deep
\par underground.  There is no windlass nor any trace of there ever having
\par been any--no rope--nothing.  Now, we know that the Romans had wells of
\par immense depth, from which the water was lifted by the 'old rag rope';
\par that at Woodhull used to be nearly a thousand feet.  Here, then, we have
\par simply an enormously deep well-hole.  The door of the room was massive,
\par and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot square.  It was evidently
\par intended for some kind of protection to someone or something; but no one
\par in those days had ever heard of anyone having been allowed even to see
\par the room.  All this is _a propos_ of a suggestion on my part that the
\par well-hole was a way by which the White Worm (whatever it was) went and
\par came.  At that time I would have had a search made--even excavation if
\par necessary--at my own expense, but all suggestions were met with a prompt
\par and explicit negative.  So, of course, I took no further step in the
\par matter.  Then it died out of recollection--even of mine."
\par 
\par "Do you remember, sir," asked Adam, "what was the appearance of the room
\par where the well-hole was?  Was there furniture--in fact, any sort of thing
\par in the room?"
\par 
\par "The only thing I remember was a sort of green light--very clouded, very
\par dim--which came up from the well.  Not a fixed light, but intermittent
\par and irregular--quite unlike anything I had ever seen."
\par 
\par "Do you remember how you got into the well-room?  Was there a separate
\par door from outside, or was there any interior room or passage which opened
\par into it?"
\par 
\par "I think there must have been some room with a way into it.  I remember
\par going up some steep steps; they must have been worn smooth by long use or
\par something of the kind, for I could hardly keep my feet as I went up.  Once
\par I stumbled and nearly fell into the well-hole."
\par 
\par "Was there anything strange about the place--any queer smell, for
\par instance?"
\par 
\par "Queer smell--yes!  Like bilge or a rank swamp.  It was distinctly
\par nauseating; when I came out I felt as if I had just been going to be
\par sick.  I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of
\par what I saw or felt."
\par 
\par "Then perhaps, sir, later in the day you will tell me anything you may
\par chance to recollect."
\par 
\par "I shall be delighted, Adam.  If your uncle has not returned by then,
\par I'll join you in the study after dinner, and we can resume this
\par interesting chat."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XVII--THE MYSTERY OF "THE GROVE"
\par 
\par 
\par That afternoon Adam decided to do a little exploring.  As he passed
\par through the wood outside the gate of Diana's Grove, he thought he saw the
\par African's face for an instant.  So he went deeper into the undergrowth,
\par and followed along parallel to the avenue to the house.  He was glad that
\par there was no workman or servant about, for he did not care that any of
\par Lady Arabella's people should find him wandering about her grounds.
\par Taking advantage of the denseness of the trees, he came close to the
\par house and skirted round it.  He was repaid for his trouble, for on the
\par far side of the house, close to where the rocky frontage of the cliff
\par fell away, he saw Oolanga crouched behind the irregular trunk of a great
\par oak.  The man was so intent on watching someone, or something, that he
\par did not guard against being himself watched.  This suited Adam, for he
\par could thus make scrutiny at will.
\par 
\par The thick wood, though the trees were mostly of small girth, threw a
\par heavy shadow, so that the steep declension, in front of which grew the
\par tree behind which the African lurked, was almost in darkness.  Adam drew
\par as close as he could, and was amazed to see a patch of light on the
\par ground before him; when he realised what it was, he was determined, more
\par than ever to follow on his quest.  The nigger had a dark lantern in his
\par hand, and was throwing the light down the steep incline.  The glare
\par showed a series of stone steps, which ended in a low-lying heavy iron
\par door fixed against the side of the house.  All the strange things he had
\par heard from Sir Nathaniel, and all those, little and big, which he had
\par himself noticed, crowded into his mind in a chaotic way.  Instinctively
\par he took refuge behind a thick oak stem, and set himself down, to watch
\par what might occur.
\par 
\par After a short time it became apparent that the African was trying to find
\par out what was behind the heavy door.  There was no way of looking in, for
\par the door fitted tight into the massive stone slabs.  The only opportunity
\par for the entrance of light was through a small hole between the great
\par stones above the door.  This hole was too high up to look through from
\par the ground level.  Oolanga, having tried standing tiptoe on the highest
\par point near, and holding the lantern as high as he could, threw the light
\par round the edges of the door to see if he could find anywhere a hole or a
\par flaw in the metal through which he could obtain a glimpse.  Foiled in
\par this, he brought from the shrubbery a plank, which he leant against the
\par top of the door and then climbed up with great dexterity.  This did not
\par bring him near enough to the window-hole to look in, or even to throw the
\par light of the lantern through it, so he climbed down and carried the plank
\par back to the place from which he had got it.  Then he concealed himself
\par near the iron door and waited, manifestly with the intent of remaining
\par there till someone came near.  Presently Lady Arabella, moving
\par noiselessly through the shade, approached the door.  When he saw her
\par close enough to touch it, Oolanga stepped forward from his concealment,
\par and spoke in a whisper, which through the gloom sounded like a hiss.
\par 
\par "I want to see you, missy--soon and secret."
\par 
\par "What do you want?"
\par 
\par "You know well, missy; I told you already."
\par 
\par She turned on him with blazing eyes, the green tint in them glowing like
\par emeralds.
\par 
\par "Come, none of that.  If there is anything sensible which you wish to say
\par to me, you can see me here, just where we are, at seven o'clock."
\par 
\par He made no reply in words, but, putting the backs of his hands together,
\par bent lower and lower till his forehead touched the earth.  Then he rose
\par and went slowly away.
\par 
\par Adam Salton, from his hiding-place, saw and wondered.  In a few minutes
\par he moved from his place and went home to Lesser Hill, fully determined
\par that seven o'clock would find him in some hidden place behind Diana's
\par Grove.
\par 
\par At a little before seven Adam stole softly out of the house and took the
\par back-way to the rear of Diana's Grove.  The place seemed silent and
\par deserted, so he took the opportunity of concealing himself near the spot
\par whence he had seen Oolanga trying to investigate whatever was concealed
\par behind the iron door.  He waited, perfectly still, and at last saw a
\par gleam of white passing soundlessly through the undergrowth.  He was not
\par surprised when he recognised the colour of Lady Arabella's dress.  She
\par came close and waited, with her face to the iron door.  From some place
\par of concealment near at hand Oolanga appeared, and came close to her.  Adam
\par noticed, with surprised amusement, that over his shoulder was the box
\par with the mongoose.  Of course the African did not know that he was seen
\par by anyone, least of all by the man whose property he had with him.
\par 
\par Silent-footed as he was, Lady Arabella heard him coming, and turned to
\par meet him.  It was somewhat hard to see in the gloom, for, as usual, he
\par was all in black, only his collar and cuffs showing white.  Lady Arabella
\par opened the conversation which ensued between the two.
\par 
\par "What do you want?  To rob me, or murder me?"
\par 
\par "No, to lub you!"
\par 
\par This frightened her a little, and she tried to change the tone.
\par 
\par "Is that a coffin you have with you?  If so, you are wasting your time.
\par It would not hold me."
\par 
\par When a nigger suspects he is being laughed at, all the ferocity of his
\par nature comes to the front; and this man was of the lowest kind.
\par 
\par "Dis ain't no coffin for nobody.  Dis box is for you.  Somefin you lub.
\par Me give him to you!"
\par 
\par Still anxious to keep off the subject of affection, on which she believed
\par him to have become crazed, she made another effort to keep his mind
\par elsewhere.
\par 
\par "Is this why you want to see me?"  He nodded.  "Then come round to the
\par other door.  But be quiet.  I have no desire to be seen so close to my
\par own house in conversation with a--a--a nigger like you!"
\par 
\par She had chosen the word deliberately.  She wished to meet his passion
\par with another kind.  Such would, at all events, help to keep him quiet.  In
\par the deep gloom she could not see the anger which suffused his face.
\par Rolling eyeballs and grinding teeth are, however, sufficient signs of
\par anger to be decipherable in the dark.  She moved round the corner of the
\par house to her right.  Oolanga was following her, when she stopped him by
\par raising her hand.
\par 
\par "No, not that door," she said; "that is not for niggers.  The other door
\par will do well enough for you!"
\par 
\par Lady Arabella took in her hand a small key which hung at the end of her
\par watch-chain, and moved to a small door, low down, round the corner, and a
\par little downhill from the edge of the Brow.  Oolanga, in obedience to her
\par gesture, went back to the iron door.  Adam looked carefully at the
\par mongoose box as the African went by, and was glad to see that it was
\par intact.  Unconsciously, as he looked, he fingered the key that was in his
\par waistcoat pocket.  When Oolanga was out of sight, Adam hurried after Lady
\par Arabella.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XVIII--EXIT OOLANGA
\par 
\par 
\par The woman turned sharply as Adam touched her shoulder.
\par 
\par "One moment whilst we are alone.  You had better not trust that nigger!"
\par he whispered.
\par 
\par Her answer was crisp and concise:
\par 
\par "I don't."
\par 
\par "Forewarned is forearmed.  Tell me if you will--it is for your own
\par protection.  Why do you mistrust him?"
\par 
\par "My friend, you have no idea of that man's impudence.  Would you believe
\par that he wants me to marry him?"
\par 
\par "No!" said Adam incredulously, amused in spite of himself.
\par 
\par "Yes, and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of treasure--at
\par least, he thought it was--stolen from Mr. Caswall.  Why do you distrust
\par him, Mr. Salton?"
\par 
\par "Did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder?  That belongs to
\par me.  I left it in the gun-room when I went to lunch.  He must have crept
\par in and stolen it.  Doubtless he thinks that it, too, is full of
\par treasure."
\par 
\par "He does!"
\par 
\par "How on earth do you know?" asked Adam.
\par 
\par "A little while ago he offered to give it to me--another bribe to accept
\par him.  Faugh!  I am ashamed to tell you such a thing.  The beast!"
\par 
\par Whilst they had been speaking, she had opened the door, a narrow iron
\par one, well hung, for it opened easily and closed tightly without any
\par creaking or sound of any kind.  Within all was dark; but she entered as
\par freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it had been broad
\par daylight.  For Adam, there was just sufficient green light from somewhere
\par for him to see that there was a broad flight of heavy stone steps leading
\par upward; but Lady Arabella, after shutting the door behind her, when it
\par closed tightly without a clang, tripped up the steps lightly and swiftly.
\par For an instant all was dark, but there came again the faint green light
\par which enabled him to see the outlines of things.  Another iron door,
\par narrow like the first and fairly high, led into another large room, the
\par walls of which were of massive stones, so closely joined together as to
\par exhibit only one smooth surface.  This presented the appearance of having
\par at one time been polished.  On the far side, also smooth like the walls,
\par was the reverse of a wide, but not high, iron door.  Here there was a
\par little more light, for the high-up aperture over the door opened to the
\par air.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella took from her girdle another small key, which she inserted
\par in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock.  The great bolt seemed
\par wonderfully hung, for the moment the small key was turned, the bolts of
\par the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron doors swung open.  On the
\par stone steps outside stood Oolanga, with the mongoose box slung over his
\par shoulder.  Lady Arabella stood a little on one side, and the African,
\par accepting the movement as an invitation, entered in an obsequious way.
\par The moment, however, that he was inside, he gave a quick look around him.
\par 
\par "Much death here--big death.  Many deaths.  Good, good!"
\par 
\par He sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent.  The matter and manner
\par of his speech were so revolting that instinctively Adam's hand wandered
\par to his revolver, and, with his finger on the trigger, he rested satisfied
\par that he was ready for any emergency.
\par 
\par There was certainly opportunity for the nigger's enjoyment, for the open
\par well-hole was almost under his nose, sending up such a stench as almost
\par made Adam sick, though Lady Arabella seemed not to mind it at all.  It
\par was like nothing that Adam had ever met with.  He compared it with all
\par the noxious experiences he had ever had--the drainage of war hospitals,
\par of slaughter-houses, the refuse of dissecting rooms.  None of these was
\par like it, though it had something of them all, with, added, the sourness
\par of chemical waste and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water-
\par logged ship whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned.
\par 
\par Then, quite unexpectedly, the negro noticed the presence of a third
\par person--Adam Salton!  He pulled out a pistol and shot at him, happily
\par missing.  Adam was himself usually a quick shot, but this time his mind
\par had been on something else and he was not ready.  However, he was quick
\par to carry out an intention, and he was not a coward.  In another moment
\par both men were in grips.  Beside them was the dark well-hole, with that
\par horrid effluvium stealing up from its mysterious depths.
\par 
\par Adam and Oolanga both had pistols; Lady Arabella, who had not one, was
\par probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting, but that
\par being impossible, she made her effort in another way.  Gliding forward,
\par she tried to seize the African; but he eluded her grasp, just missing, in
\par doing so, falling into the mysterious hole.  As he swayed back to firm
\par foothold, he turned his own gun on her and shot.  Instinctively Adam
\par leaped at his assailant; clutching at each other, they tottered on the
\par very brink.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella's anger, now fully awake, was all for Oolanga.  She moved
\par towards him with her hands extended, and had just seized him when the
\par catch of the locked box--due to some movement from within--flew open, and
\par the king-cobra-killer flew at her with a venomous fury impossible to
\par describe.  As it seized her throat, she caught hold of it, and, with a
\par fury superior to its own, tore it in two just as if it had been a sheet
\par of paper.  The strength used for such an act must have been terrific.  In
\par an instant, it seemed to spout blood and entrails, and was hurled into
\par the well-hole.  In another instant she had seized Oolanga, and with a
\par swift rush had drawn him, her white arms encircling him, down with her
\par into the gaping aperture.
\par 
\par Adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling circle, and
\par as it sank down into the well, a pair of blazing green eyes became fixed,
\par sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity, and disappeared, throwing
\par upward the green light which grew more and more vivid every moment.  As
\par the light sank into the noisome depths, there came a shriek which chilled
\par Adam's blood--a prolonged agony of pain and terror which seemed to have
\par no end.
\par 
\par Adam Salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from the
\par memory of those dreadful moments.  The gloom which surrounded that
\par horrible charnel pit, which seemed to go down to the very bowels of the
\par earth, conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of the nethermost
\par hell.  The ghastly fate of the African as he sank down to his terrible
\par doom, his black face growing grey with terror, his white eyeballs, now
\par like veined bloodstone, rolling in the helpless extremity of fear.  The
\par mysterious green light was in itself a milieu of horror.  And through it
\par all the awful cry came up from that fathomless pit, whose entrance was
\par flooded with spots of fresh blood.  Even the death of the fearless little
\par snake-killer--so fierce, so frightful, as if stained with a ferocity
\par which told of no living force above earth, but only of the devils of the
\par pit--was only an incident.  Adam was in a state of intellectual tumult,
\par which had no parallel in his experience.  He tried to rush away from the
\par horrible place; even the baleful green light, thrown up through the
\par gloomy well-shaft, was dying away as its source sank deeper into the
\par primeval ooze.  The darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming
\par density--darkness in such a place and with such a memory of it!
\par 
\par He made a wild rush forward--slipt on the steps in some sticky, acrid-
\par smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood, and, falling forward, felt
\par his way into the inner room, where the well-shaft was not.
\par 
\par Then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement.  Up the stone steps from the
\par narrow door by which he had entered, glided the white-clad figure of Lady
\par Arabella, the only colour to be seen on her being blood-marks on her face
\par and hands and throat.  Otherwise, she was calm and unruffled, as when
\par earlier she stood aside for him to pass in through the narrow iron door.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XIX--AN ENEMY IN THE DARK
\par 
\par 
\par Adam Salton went for a walk before returning to Lesser Hill; he felt that
\par it might be well, not only to steady his nerves, shaken by the horrible
\par scene, but to get his thoughts into some sort of order, so as to be ready
\par to enter on the matter with Sir Nathaniel.  He was a little embarrassed
\par as to telling his uncle, for affairs had so vastly progressed beyond his
\par original view that he felt a little doubtful as to what would be the old
\par gentleman's attitude when he should hear of the strange events for the
\par first time.  Mr. Salton would certainly not be satisfied at being treated
\par as an outsider with regard to such things, most of which had points of
\par contact with the inmates of his own house.  It was with an immense sense
\par of relief that Adam heard that his uncle had telegraphed to the
\par housekeeper that he was detained by business at Walsall, where he would
\par remain for the night; and that he would be back in the morning in time
\par for lunch.
\par 
\par When Adam got home after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel just going to
\par bed.  He did not say anything to him then of what had happened, but
\par contented himself with arranging that they would walk together in the
\par early morning, as he had much to say that would require serious
\par attention.
\par 
\par Strangely enough he slept well, and awoke at dawn with his mind clear and
\par his nerves in their usual unshaken condition.  The maid brought up, with
\par his early morning cup of tea, a note which had been found in the letter-
\par box.  It was from Lady Arabella, and was evidently intended to put him on
\par his guard as to what he should say about the previous evening.
\par 
\par He read it over carefully several times, before he was satisfied that he
\par had taken in its full import.
\par 
\par    "DEAR MR. SALTON,
\par 
\par    "I cannot go to bed until I have written to you, so you must forgive
\par    me if I disturb you, and at an unseemly time.  Indeed, you must also
\par    forgive me if, in trying to do what is right, I err in saying too much
\par    or too little.  The fact is that I am quite upset and unnerved by all
\par    that has happened in this terrible night.  I find it difficult even to
\par    write; my hands shake so that they are not under control, and I am
\par    trembling all over with memory of the horrors we saw enacted before
\par    our eyes.  I am grieved beyond measure that I should be, however
\par    remotely, a cause of this horror coming on you.  Forgive me if you
\par    can, and do not think too hardly of me.  This I ask with confidence,
\par    for since we shared together the danger--the very pangs--of death, I
\par    feel that we should be to one another something more than mere
\par    friends, that I may lean on you and trust you, assured that your
\par    sympathy and pity are for me.  You really must let me thank you for
\par    the friendliness, the help, the confidence, the real aid at a time of
\par    deadly danger and deadly fear which you showed me.  That awful man--I
\par    shall see him for ever in my dreams.  His black, malignant face will
\par    shut out all memory of sunshine and happiness.  I shall eternally see
\par    his evil eyes as he threw himself into that well-hole in a vain effort
\par    to escape from the consequences of his own misdoing.  The more I think
\par    of it, the more apparent it seems to me that he had premeditated the
\par    whole thing--of course, except his own horrible death.
\par 
\par    "Perhaps you have noticed a fur collar I occasionally wear.  It is one
\par    of my most valued treasures--an ermine collar studded with emeralds.  I
\par    had often seen the nigger's eyes gleam covetously when he looked at
\par    it.  Unhappily, I wore it yesterday.  That may have been the cause
\par    that lured the poor man to his doom.  On the very brink of the abyss
\par    he tore the collar from my neck--that was the last I saw of him.  When
\par    he sank into the hole, I was rushing to the iron door, which I pulled
\par    behind me.  When I heard that soul-sickening yell, which marked his
\par    disappearance in the chasm, I was more glad than I can say that my
\par    eyes were spared the pain and horror which my ears had to endure.
\par 
\par    "When I tore myself out of the negro's grasp as he sank into the well-
\par    hole; I realised what freedom meant.  Freedom!  Freedom!  Not only
\par    from that noisome prison-house, which has now such a memory, but from
\par    the more noisome embrace of that hideous monster.  Whilst I live, I
\par    shall always thank you for my freedom.  A woman must sometimes express
\par    her gratitude; otherwise it becomes too great to bear.  I am not a
\par    sentimental girl, who merely likes to thank a man; I am a woman who
\par    knows all, of bad as well as good, that life can give.  I have known
\par    what it is to love and to lose.  But you must not let me bring any
\par    unhappiness into your life.  I must live on--as I have lived--alone,
\par    and, in addition, bear with other woes the memory of this latest
\par    insult and horror.  In the meantime, I must get away as quickly as
\par    possible from Diana's Grove.  In the morning I shall go up to town,
\par    where I shall remain for a week--I cannot stay longer, as business
\par    affairs demand my presence here.  I think, however, that a week in the
\par    rush of busy London, surrounded with multitudes of commonplace people,
\par    will help to soften--I cannot expect total obliteration--the terrible
\par    images of the bygone night.  When I can sleep easily--which will be, I
\par    hope, after a day or two--I shall be fit to return home and take up
\par    again the burden which will, I suppose, always be with me.
\par 
\par    "I shall be most happy to see you on my return--or earlier, if my good
\par    fortune sends you on any errand to London.  I shall stay at the
\par    Mayfair Hotel.  In that busy spot we may forget some of the dangers
\par    and horrors we have shared together.  Adieu, and thank you, again and
\par    again, for all your kindness and consideration to me.
\par 
\par    "ARABELLA MARSH."
\par 
\par Adam was surprised by this effusive epistle, but he determined to say
\par nothing of it to Sir Nathaniel until he should have thought it well over.
\par When Adam met Sir Nathaniel at breakfast, he was glad that he had taken
\par time to turn things over in his mind.  The result had been that not only
\par was he familiar with the facts in all their bearings, but he had already
\par so far differentiated them that he was able to arrange them in his own
\par mind according to their values.  Breakfast had been a silent function, so
\par it did not interfere in any way with the process of thought.
\par 
\par So soon as the door was closed, Sir Nathaniel began:
\par 
\par "I see, Adam, that something has occurred, and that you have much to tell
\par me."
\par 
\par "That is so, sir.  I suppose I had better begin by telling you all I
\par know--all that has happened since I left you yesterday?"
\par 
\par Accordingly Adam gave him details of all that had happened during the
\par previous evening.  He confined himself rigidly to the narration of
\par circumstances, taking care not to colour events by any comment of his
\par own, or any opinion of the meaning of things which he did not fully
\par understand.  At first, Sir Nathaniel seemed disposed to ask questions,
\par but shortly gave this up when he recognised that the narration was
\par concise and self-explanatory.  Thenceforth, he contented himself with
\par quick looks and glances, easily interpreted, or by some acquiescent
\par motions of his hands, when such could be convenient, to emphasise his
\par idea of the correctness of any inference.  Until Adam ceased speaking,
\par having evidently come to an end of what he had to say with regard to this
\par section of his story, the elder man made no comment whatever.  Even when
\par Adam took from his pocket Lady Arabella's letter, with the manifest
\par intention of reading it, he did not make any comment.  Finally, when Adam
\par folded up the letter and put it, in its envelope, back in his pocket, as
\par an intimation that he had now quite finished, the old diplomatist
\par carefully made a few notes in his pocket-book.
\par 
\par "Your narrative, my dear Adam, is altogether admirable.  I think I may
\par now take it that we are both well versed in the actual facts, and that
\par our conference had better take the shape of a mutual exchange of ideas.
\par Let us both ask questions as they may arise; and I do not doubt that we
\par shall arrive at some enlightening conclusions."
\par 
\par "Will you kindly begin, sir?  I do not doubt that, with your longer
\par experience, you will be able to dissipate some of the fog which envelops
\par certain of the things which we have to consider."
\par 
\par "I hope so, my dear boy.  For a beginning, then, let me say that Lady
\par Arabella's letter makes clear some things which she intended--and also
\par some things which she did not intend.  But, before I begin to draw
\par deductions, let me ask you a few questions.  Adam, are you heart-whole,
\par quite heart-whole, in the matter of Lady Arabella?"
\par 
\par His companion answered at once, each looking the other straight in the
\par eyes during question and answer.
\par 
\par "Lady Arabella, sir, is a charming woman, and I should have deemed it a
\par privilege to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the
\par confessional--to flirt a little with her.  But if you mean to ask if my
\par affections are in any way engaged, I can emphatically answer 'No!'--as
\par indeed you will understand when presently I give you the reason.  Apart
\par from that, there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day."
\par 
\par "Could you--would you mind giving me the reason now?  It will help us to
\par understand what is before us, in the way of difficulty."
\par 
\par "Certainly, sir.  My reason, on which I can fully depend, is that I love
\par another woman!"
\par 
\par "That clinches it.  May I offer my good wishes, and, I hope, my
\par congratulations?"
\par 
\par "I am proud of your good wishes, sir, and I thank you for them.  But it
\par is too soon for congratulations--the lady does not even know my hopes
\par yet.  Indeed, I hardly knew them myself, as definite, till this moment."
\par 
\par "I take it then, Adam, that at the right time I may be allowed to know
\par who the lady is?"
\par 
\par Adam laughed a low, sweet laugh, such as ripples from a happy heart.
\par 
\par "There need not be an hour's, a minute's delay.  I shall be glad to share
\par my secret with you, sir.  The lady, sir, whom I am so happy as to love,
\par and in whom my dreams of life-long happiness are centred, is Mimi
\par Watford!"
\par 
\par "Then, my dear Adam, I need not wait to offer congratulations.  She is
\par indeed a very charming young lady.  I do not think I ever saw a girl who
\par united in such perfection the qualities of strength of character and
\par sweetness of disposition.  With all my heart, I congratulate you.  Then I
\par may take it that my question as to your heart-wholeness is answered in
\par the affirmative?"
\par 
\par "Yes; and now, sir, may I ask in turn why the question?"
\par 
\par "Certainly!  I asked because it seems to me that we are coming to a point
\par where my questions might be painful to you."
\par 
\par "It is not merely that I love Mimi, but I have reason to look on Lady
\par Arabella as her enemy," Adam continued.
\par 
\par "Her enemy?"
\par 
\par "Yes.  A rank and unscrupulous enemy who is bent on her destruction."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel went to the door, looked outside it and returned, locking
\par it carefully behind him.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XX--METABOLISM
\par 
\par 
\par "Am I looking grave?" asked Sir Nathaniel inconsequently when he
\par re-entered the room.
\par 
\par "You certainly are, sir."
\par 
\par "We little thought when first we met that we should be drawn into such a
\par vortex.  Already we are mixed up in robbery, and probably murder, but--a
\par thousand times worse than all the crimes in the calendar--in an affair of
\par ghastly mystery which has no bottom and no end--with forces of the most
\par unnerving kind, which had their origin in an age when the world was
\par different from the world which we know.  We are going back to the origin
\par of superstition--to an age when dragons tore each other in their slime.
\par We must fear nothing--no conclusion, however improbable, almost
\par impossible it may be.  Life and death is hanging on our judgment, not
\par only for ourselves, but for others whom we love.  Remember, I count on
\par you as I hope you count on me."
\par 
\par "I do, with all confidence."
\par 
\par "Then," said Sir Nathaniel, "let us think justly and boldly and fear
\par nothing, however terrifying it may seem.  I suppose I am to take as exact
\par in every detail your account of all the strange things which happened
\par whilst you were in Diana's Grove?"
\par 
\par "So far as I know, yes.  Of course I may be mistaken in recollection of
\par some detail or another, but I am certain that in the main what I have
\par said is correct."
\par 
\par "You feel sure that you saw Lady Arabella seize the negro round the neck,
\par and drag him down with her into the hole?"
\par 
\par "Absolutely certain, sir, otherwise I should have gone to her
\par assistance."
\par 
\par "We have, then, an account of what happened from an eye-witness whom we
\par trust--that is yourself.  We have also another account, written by Lady
\par Arabella under her own hand.  These two accounts do not agree.  Therefore
\par we must take it that one of the two is lying."
\par 
\par "Apparently, sir."
\par 
\par "And that Lady Arabella is the liar!"
\par 
\par "Apparently--as I am not."
\par 
\par "We must, therefore, try to find a reason for her lying.  She has nothing
\par to fear from Oolanga, who is dead.  Therefore the only reason which could
\par actuate her would be to convince someone else that she was blameless.
\par This 'someone' could not be you, for you had the evidence of your own
\par eyes.  There was no one else present; therefore it must have been an
\par absent person."
\par 
\par "That seems beyond dispute, sir."
\par 
\par "There is only one other person whose good opinion she could wish to
\par keep--Edgar Caswall.  He is the only one who fills the bill.  Her lies
\par point to other things besides the death of the African.  She evidently
\par wanted it to be accepted that his falling into the well was his own act.
\par I cannot suppose that she expected to convince you, the eye-witness; but
\par if she wished later on to spread the story, it was wise of her to try to
\par get your acceptance of it."
\par 
\par "That is so!"
\par 
\par "Then there were other matters of untruth.  That, for instance, of the
\par ermine collar embroidered with emeralds.  If an understandable reason be
\par required for this, it would be to draw attention away from the green
\par lights which were seen in the room, and especially in the well-hole.  Any
\par unprejudiced person would accept the green lights to be the eyes of a
\par great snake, such as tradition pointed to living in the well-hole.  In
\par fine, therefore, Lady Arabella wanted the general belief to be that there
\par was no snake of the kind in Diana's Grove.  For my own part, I don't
\par believe in a partial liar--this art does not deal in veneer; a liar is a
\par liar right through.  Self-interest may prompt falsity of the tongue; but
\par if one prove to be a liar, nothing that he says can ever be believed.
\par This leads us to the conclusion that because she said or inferred that
\par there was no snake, we should look for one--and expect to find it, too.
\par 
\par "Now let me digress.  I live, and have for many years lived, in
\par Derbyshire, a county more celebrated for its caves than any other county
\par in England.  I have been through them all, and am familiar with every
\par turn of them; as also with other great caves in Kentucky, in France, in
\par Germany, and a host of other places--in many of these are tremendously
\par deep caves of narrow aperture, which are valued by intrepid explorers,
\par who descend narrow gullets of abysmal depth--and sometimes never return.
\par In many of the caverns in the Peak I am convinced that some of the
\par smaller passages were used in primeval times as the lairs of some of the
\par great serpents of legend and tradition.  It may have been that such
\par caverns were formed in the usual geologic way--bubbles or flaws in the
\par earth's crust--which were later used by the monsters of the period of the
\par young world.  It may have been, of course, that some of them were worn
\par originally by water; but in time they all found a use when suitable for
\par living monsters.
\par 
\par "This brings us to another point, more difficult to accept and understand
\par than any other requiring belief in a base not usually accepted, or indeed
\par entered on--whether such abnormal growths could have ever changed in
\par their nature.  Some day the study of metabolism may progress so far as to
\par enable us to accept structural changes proceeding from an intellectual or
\par moral base.  We may lean towards a belief that great animal strength may
\par be a sound base for changes of all sorts.  If this be so, what could be a
\par more fitting subject than primeval monsters whose strength was such as to
\par allow a survival of thousands of years?  We do not know yet if brain can
\par increase and develop independently of other parts of the living
\par structure.
\par 
\par "After all, the mediaeval belief in the Philosopher's Stone which could
\par transmute metals, has its counterpart in the accepted theory of
\par metabolism which changes living tissue.  In an age of investigation like
\par our own, when we are returning to science as the base of wonders--almost
\par of miracles--we should be slow to refuse to accept facts, however
\par impossible they may seem to be.
\par 
\par "Let us suppose a monster of the early days of the world--a dragon of the
\par prime--of vast age running into thousands of years, to whom had been
\par conveyed in some way--it matters not--a brain just sufficient for the
\par beginning of growth.  Suppose the monster to be of incalculable size and
\par of a strength quite abnormal--a veritable incarnation of animal strength.
\par Suppose this animal is allowed to remain in one place, thus being removed
\par from accidents of interrupted development; might not, would not this
\par creature, in process of time--ages, if necessary--have that rudimentary
\par intelligence developed?  There is no impossibility in this; it is only
\par the natural process of evolution.  In the beginning, the instincts of
\par animals are confined to alimentation, self-protection, and the
\par multiplication of their species.  As time goes on and the needs of life
\par become more complex, power follows need.  We have been long accustomed to
\par consider growth as applied almost exclusively to size in its various
\par aspects.  But Nature, who has no doctrinaire ideas, may equally apply it
\par to concentration.  A developing thing may expand in any given way or
\par form.  Now, it is a scientific law that increase implies gain and loss of
\par various kinds; what a thing gains in one direction it may lose in
\par another.  May it not be that Mother Nature may deliberately encourage
\par decrease as well as increase--that it may be an axiom that what is gained
\par in concentration is lost in size?  Take, for instance, monsters that
\par tradition has accepted and localised, such as the Worm of Lambton or that
\par of Spindleston Heugh.  If such a creature were, by its own process of
\par metabolism, to change much of its bulk for intellectual growth, we should
\par at once arrive at a new class of creature--more dangerous, perhaps, than
\par the world has ever had any experience of--a force which can think, which
\par has no soul and no morals, and therefore no acceptance of responsibility.
\par A snake would be a good illustration of this, for it is cold-blooded, and
\par therefore removed from the temptations which often weaken or restrict
\par warm-blooded creatures.  If, for instance, the Worm of Lambton--if such
\par ever existed--were guided to its own ends by an organised intelligence
\par capable of expansion, what form of creature could we imagine which would
\par equal it in potentialities of evil?  Why, such a being would devastate a
\par whole country.  Now, all these things require much thought, and we want
\par to apply the knowledge usefully, and we should therefore be exact.  Would
\par it not be well to resume the subject later in the day?"
\par 
\par "I quite agree, sir.  I am in a whirl already; and want to attend
\par carefully to what you say; so that I may try to digest it."
\par 
\par Both men seemed fresher and better for the "easy," and when they met in
\par the afternoon each of them had something to contribute to the general
\par stock of information.  Adam, who was by nature of a more militant
\par disposition than his elderly friend, was glad to see that the conference
\par at once assumed a practical trend.  Sir Nathaniel recognised this, and,
\par like an old diplomatist, turned it to present use.
\par 
\par "Tell me now, Adam, what is the outcome, in your own mind, of our
\par conversation?"
\par 
\par "That the whole difficulty already assumes practical shape; but with
\par added dangers, that at first I did not imagine."
\par 
\par "What is the practical shape, and what are the added dangers?  I am not
\par disputing, but only trying to clear my own ideas by the consideration of
\par yours--"
\par 
\par So Adam went on:
\par 
\par "In the past, in the early days of the world, there were monsters who
\par were so vast that they could exist for thousands of years.  Some of them
\par must have overlapped the Christian era.  They may have progressed
\par intellectually in process of time.  If they had in any way so progressed,
\par or even got the most rudimentary form of brain, they would be the most
\par dangerous things that ever were in the world.  Tradition says that one of
\par these monsters lived in the Marsh of the East, and came up to a cave in
\par Diana's Grove, which was also called the Lair of the White Worm.  Such
\par creatures may have grown down as well as up.  They _may_ have grown into,
\par or something like, human beings.  Lady Arabella March is of snake nature.
\par She has committed crimes to our knowledge.  She retains something of the
\par vast strength of her primal being--can see in the dark--has the eyes of a
\par snake.  She used the nigger, and then dragged him through the snake's
\par hole down to the swamp; she is intent on evil, and hates some one we
\par love.  Result . . . "
\par 
\par "Yes, the result?"
\par 
\par "First, that Mimi Watford should be taken away at once--then--"
\par 
\par "Yes?"
\par 
\par "The monster must be destroyed."
\par 
\par "Bravo!  That is a true and fearless conclusion.  At whatever cost, it
\par must be carried out."
\par 
\par "At once?"
\par 
\par "Soon, at all events.  That creature's very existence is a danger.  Her
\par presence in this neighbourhood makes the danger immediate."
\par 
\par As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel's mouth hardened and his eyebrows came down
\par till they met.  There was no doubting his concurrence in the resolution,
\par or his readiness to help in carrying it out.  But he was an elderly man
\par with much experience and knowledge of law and diplomacy.  It seemed to
\par him to be a stern duty to prevent anything irrevocable taking place till
\par it had been thought out and all was ready.  There were all sorts of legal
\par cruxes to be thought out, not only regarding the taking of life, even of
\par a monstrosity in human form, but also of property.  Lady Arabella, be she
\par woman or snake or devil, owned the ground she moved in, according to
\par British law, and the law is jealous and swift to avenge wrongs done
\par within its ken.  All such difficulties should be--must be--avoided for
\par Mr. Salton's sake, for Adam's own sake, and, most of all, for Mimi
\par Watford's sake.
\par 
\par Before he spoke again, Sir Nathaniel had made up his mind that he must
\par try to postpone decisive action until the circumstances on which they
\par depended--which, after all, were only problematical--should have been
\par tested satisfactorily, one way or another.  When he did speak, Adam at
\par first thought that his friend was wavering in his intention, or "funking"
\par the responsibility.  However, his respect for Sir Nathaniel was so great
\par that he would not act, or even come to a conclusion on a vital point,
\par without his sanction.
\par 
\par He came close and whispered in his ear:
\par 
\par "We will prepare our plans to combat and destroy this horrible menace,
\par after we have cleared up some of the more baffling points.  Meanwhile, we
\par must wait for the night--I hear my uncle's footsteps echoing down the
\par hall."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel nodded his approval.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXI--GREEN LIGHT
\par 
\par 
\par When old Mr. Salton had retired for the night, Adam and Sir Nathaniel
\par returned to the study.  Things went with great regularity at Lesser Hill,
\par so they knew that there would be no interruption to their talk.
\par 
\par When their cigars were lighted, Sir Nathaniel began.
\par 
\par "I hope, Adam, that you do not think me either slack or changeable of
\par purpose.  I mean to go through this business to the bitter end--whatever
\par it may be.  Be satisfied that my first care is, and shall be, the
\par protection of Mimi Watford.  To that I am pledged; my dear boy, we who
\par are interested are all in the same danger.  That semi-human monster out
\par of the pit hates and means to destroy us all--you and me certainly, and
\par probably your uncle.  I wanted especially to talk with you to-night, for
\par I cannot help thinking that the time is fast coming--if it has not come
\par already--when we must take your uncle into our confidence.  It was one
\par thing when fancied evils threatened, but now he is probably marked for
\par death, and it is only right that he should know all."
\par 
\par "I am with you, sir.  Things have changed since we agreed to keep him out
\par of the trouble.  Now we dare not; consideration for his feelings might
\par cost his life.  It is a duty--and no light or pleasant one, either.  I
\par have not a shadow of doubt that he will want to be one with us in this.
\par But remember, we are his guests; his name, his honour, have to be thought
\par of as well as his safety."
\par 
\par "All shall be as you wish, Adam.  And now as to what we are to do?  We
\par cannot murder Lady Arabella off-hand.  Therefore we shall have to put
\par things in order for the killing, and in such a way that we cannot be
\par taxed with a crime."
\par 
\par "It seems to me, sir, that we are in an exceedingly tight place.  Our
\par first difficulty is to know where to begin.  I never thought this
\par fighting an antediluvian monster would be such a complicated job.  This
\par one is a woman, with all a woman's wit, combined with the heartlessness
\par of a _cocotte_.  She has the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus.
\par We may be sure that in the fight that is before us there will be no
\par semblance of fair-play.  Also that our unscrupulous opponent will not
\par betray herself!"
\par 
\par "That is so--but being feminine, she will probably over-reach herself.
\par Now, Adam, it strikes me that, as we have to protect ourselves and others
\par against feminine nature, our strong game will be to play our masculine
\par against her feminine.  Perhaps we had better sleep on it.  She is a thing
\par of the night; and the night may give us some ideas."
\par 
\par So they both turned in.
\par 
\par Adam knocked at Sir Nathaniel's door in the grey of the morning, and, on
\par being bidden, came into the room.  He had several letters in his hand.
\par Sir Nathaniel sat up in bed.
\par 
\par "Well!"
\par 
\par "I should like to read you a few letters, but, of course, I shall not
\par send them unless you approve.  In fact"--with a smile and a blush--"there
\par are several things which I want to do; but I hold my hand and my tongue
\par till I have your approval."
\par 
\par "Go on!" said the other kindly.  "Tell me all, and count at any rate on
\par my sympathy, and on my approval and help if I can see my way."
\par 
\par Accordingly Adam proceeded:
\par 
\par "When I told you the conclusions at which I had arrived, I put in the
\par foreground that Mimi Watford should, for the sake of her own safety, be
\par removed--and that the monster which had wrought all the harm should be
\par destroyed."
\par 
\par "Yes, that is so."
\par 
\par "To carry this into practice, sir, one preliminary is required--unless
\par harm of another kind is to be faced.  Mimi should have some protector
\par whom all the world would recognise.  The only form recognised by
\par convention is marriage!"
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel smiled in a fatherly way.
\par 
\par "To marry, a husband is required.  And that husband should be you."
\par 
\par "Yes, yes."
\par 
\par "And the marriage should be immediate and secret--or, at least, not
\par spoken of outside ourselves.  Would the young lady be agreeable to that
\par proceeding?"
\par 
\par "I do not know, sir!"
\par 
\par "Then how are we to proceed?"
\par 
\par "I suppose that we--or one of us--must ask her."
\par 
\par "Is this a sudden idea, Adam, a sudden resolution?"
\par 
\par "A sudden resolution, sir, but not a sudden idea.  If she agrees, all is
\par well and good.  The sequence is obvious."
\par 
\par "And it is to be kept a secret amongst ourselves?"
\par 
\par "I want no secret, sir, except for Mimi's good.  For myself, I should
\par like to shout it from the house-tops!  But we must be discreet; untimely
\par knowledge to our enemy might work incalculable harm."
\par 
\par "And how would you suggest, Adam, that we could combine the momentous
\par question with secrecy?"
\par 
\par Adam grew red and moved uneasily.
\par 
\par "Someone must ask her--as soon as possible!"
\par 
\par "And that someone?"
\par 
\par "I thought that you, sir, would be so good!"
\par 
\par "God bless my soul!  This is a new kind of duty to take on--at my time of
\par life.  Adam, I hope you know that you can count on me to help in any way
\par I can!"
\par 
\par "I have already counted on you, sir, when I ventured to make such a
\par suggestion.  I can only ask," he added, "that you will be more than ever
\par kind to me--to us--and look on the painful duty as a voluntary act of
\par grace, prompted by kindness and affection."
\par 
\par "Painful duty!"
\par 
\par "Yes," said Adam boldly.  "Painful to you, though to me it would be all
\par joyful."
\par 
\par "It is a strange job for an early morning!  Well, we all live and learn.
\par I suppose the sooner I go the better.  You had better write a line for me
\par to take with me.  For, you see, this is to be a somewhat unusual
\par transaction, and it may be embarrassing to the lady, even to myself.  So
\par we ought to have some sort of warrant, something to show that we have
\par been mindful of her feelings.  It will not do to take acquiescence for
\par granted--although we act for her good."
\par 
\par "Sir Nathaniel, you are a true friend; I am sure that both Mimi and I
\par shall be grateful to you for all our lives--however long they may be!"
\par 
\par So the two talked it over and agreed as to points to be borne in mind by
\par the ambassador.  It was striking ten when Sir Nathaniel left the house,
\par Adam seeing him quietly off.
\par 
\par As the young man followed him with wistful eyes--almost jealous of the
\par privilege which his kind deed was about to bring him--he felt that his
\par own heart was in his friend's breast.
\par 
\par The memory of that morning was like a dream to all those concerned in it.
\par Sir Nathaniel had a confused recollection of detail and sequence, though
\par the main facts stood out in his memory boldly and clearly.  Adam Salton's
\par recollection was of an illimitable wait, filled with anxiety, hope, and
\par chagrin, all dominated by a sense of the slow passage of time and
\par accompanied by vague fears.  Mimi could not for a long time think at all,
\par or recollect anything, except that Adam loved her and was saving her from
\par a terrible danger.  When she had time to think, later on, she wondered
\par when she had any ignorance of the fact that Adam loved her, and that she
\par loved him with all her heart.  Everything, every recollection however
\par small, every feeling, seemed to fit into those elemental facts as though
\par they had all been moulded together.  The main and crowning recollection
\par was her saying goodbye to Sir Nathaniel, and entrusting to him loving
\par messages, straight from her heart, to Adam Salton, and of his bearing
\par when--with an impulse which she could not check--she put her lips to his
\par and kissed him.  Later, when she was alone and had time to think, it was
\par a passing grief to her that she would have to be silent, for a time, to
\par Lilla on the happy events of that strange mission.
\par 
\par She had, of course, agreed to keep all secret until Adam should give her
\par leave to speak.
\par 
\par The advice and assistance of Sir Nathaniel was a great help to Adam in
\par carrying out his idea of marrying Mimi Watford without publicity.  He
\par went with him to London, and, with his influence, the young man obtained
\par the license of the Archbishop of Canterbury for a private marriage.  Sir
\par Nathaniel then persuaded old Mr. Salton to allow his nephew to spend a
\par few weeks with him at Doom Tower, and it was here that Mimi became Adam's
\par wife.  But that was only the first step in their plans; before going
\par further, however, Adam took his bride off to the Isle of Man.  He wished
\par to place a stretch of sea between Mimi and the White Worm, while things
\par matured.  On their return, Sir Nathaniel met them and drove them at once
\par to Doom, taking care to avoid any one that he knew on the journey.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel had taken care to have the doors and windows shut and
\par locked--all but the door used for their entry.  The shutters were up and
\par the blinds down.  Moreover, heavy curtains were drawn across the windows.
\par When Adam commented on this, Sir Nathaniel said in a whisper:
\par 
\par "Wait till we are alone, and I'll tell you why this is done; in the
\par meantime not a word or a sign.  You will approve when we have had a talk
\par together."
\par 
\par They said no more on the subject till after dinner, when they were
\par ensconced in Sir Nathaniel's study, which was on the top storey.  Doom
\par Tower was a lofty structure, situated on an eminence high up in the Peak.
\par The top commanded a wide prospect, ranging from the hills above the
\par Ribble to the near side of the Brow, which marked the northern bound of
\par ancient Mercia.  It was of the early Norman period, less than a century
\par younger than Castra Regis.  The windows of the study were barred and
\par locked, and heavy dark curtains closed them in.  When this was done not a
\par gleam of light from the tower could be seen from outside.
\par 
\par When they were alone, Sir Nathaniel explained that he had taken his old
\par friend, Mr. Salton, into full confidence, and that in future all would
\par work together.
\par 
\par "It is important for you to be extremely careful.  In spite of the fact
\par that our marriage was kept secret, as also your temporary absence, both
\par are known."
\par 
\par "How?  To whom?"
\par 
\par "How, I know not; but I am beginning to have an idea."
\par 
\par "To her?" asked Adam, in momentary consternation.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel shivered perceptibly.
\par 
\par "The White Worm--yes!"
\par 
\par Adam noticed that from now on, his friend never spoke of Lady Arabella
\par otherwise, except when he wished to divert the suspicion of others.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel switched off the electric light, and when the room was
\par pitch dark, he came to Adam, took him by the hand, and led him to a seat
\par set in the southern window.  Then he softly drew back a piece of the
\par curtain and motioned his companion to look out.
\par 
\par Adam did so, and immediately shrank back as though his eyes had opened on
\par pressing danger.  His companion set his mind at rest by saying in a low
\par voice:
\par 
\par "It is all right; you may speak, but speak low.  There is no danger
\par here--at present!"
\par 
\par Adam leaned forward, taking care, however, not to press his face against
\par the glass.  What he saw would not under ordinary circumstances have
\par caused concern to anybody.  With his special knowledge, it was
\par appalling--though the night was now so dark that in reality there was
\par little to be seen.
\par 
\par On the western side of the tower stood a grove of old trees, of forest
\par dimensions.  They were not grouped closely, but stood a little apart from
\par each other, producing the effect of a row widely planted.  Over the tops
\par of them was seen a green light, something like the danger signal at a
\par railway-crossing.  It seemed at first quite still; but presently, when
\par Adam's eye became accustomed to it, he could see that it moved as if
\par trembling.  This at once recalled to Adam's mind the light quivering
\par above the well-hole in the darkness of that inner room at Diana's Grove,
\par Oolanga's awful shriek, and the hideous black face, now grown grey with
\par terror, disappearing into the impenetrable gloom of the mysterious
\par orifice.  Instinctively he laid his hand on his revolver, and stood up
\par ready to protect his wife.  Then, seeing that nothing happened, and that
\par the light and all outside the tower remained the same, he softly pulled
\par the curtain over the window.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel switched on the light again, and in its comforting glow
\par they began to talk freely.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXII--AT CLOSE QUARTERS
\par 
\par 
\par "She has diabolical cunning," said Sir Nathaniel.  "Ever since you left,
\par she has ranged along the Brow and wherever you were accustomed to
\par frequent.  I have not heard whence the knowledge of your movements came
\par to her, nor have I been able to learn any data whereon to found an
\par opinion.  She seems to have heard both of your marriage and your absence;
\par but I gather, by inference, that she does not actually know where you and
\par Mimi are, or of your return.  So soon as the dusk fails, she goes out on
\par her rounds, and before dawn covers the whole ground round the Brow, and
\par away up into the heart of the Peak.  The White Worm, in her own proper
\par shape, certainly has great facilities for the business on which she is
\par now engaged.  She can look into windows of any ordinary kind.  Happily,
\par this house is beyond her reach, if she wishes--as she manifestly does--to
\par remain unrecognised.  But, even at this height, it is wise to show no
\par lights, lest she might learn something of our presence or absence."
\par 
\par "Would it not be well, sir, if one of us could see this monster in her
\par real shape at close quarters?  I am willing to run the risk--for I take
\par it there would be no slight risk in the doing.  I don't suppose anyone of
\par our time has seen her close and lived to tell the tale."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel held up an expostulatory hand.
\par 
\par "Good God, lad, what are you suggesting?  Think of your wife, and all
\par that is at stake."
\par 
\par "It is of Mimi that I think--for her sake that I am willing to risk
\par whatever is to be risked."
\par 
\par Adam's young bride was proud of her man, but she blanched at the thought
\par of the ghastly White Worm.  Adam saw this and at once reassured her.
\par 
\par "So long as her ladyship does not know whereabout I am, I shall have as
\par much safety as remains to us; bear in mind, my darling, that we cannot be
\par too careful."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel realised that Adam was right; the White Worm had no
\par supernatural powers and could not harm them until she discovered their
\par hiding place.  It was agreed, therefore, that the two men should go
\par together.
\par 
\par When the two men slipped out by the back door of the house, they walked
\par cautiously along the avenue which trended towards the west.  Everything
\par was pitch dark--so dark that at times they had to feel their way by the
\par palings and tree-trunks.  They could still see, seemingly far in front of
\par them and high up, the baleful light which at the height and distance
\par seemed like a faint line.  As they were now on the level of the ground,
\par the light seemed infinitely higher than it had from the top of the tower.
\par At the sight Adam's heart fell; the danger of the desperate enterprise
\par which he had undertaken burst upon him.  But this feeling was shortly
\par followed by another which restored him to himself--a fierce loathing, and
\par a desire to kill, such as he had never experienced before.
\par 
\par They went on for some distance on a level road, fairly wide, from which
\par the green light was visible.  Here Sir Nathaniel spoke softly, placing
\par his lips to Adam's ear for safety.
\par 
\par "We know nothing whatever of this creature's power of hearing or
\par smelling, though I presume that both are of no great strength.  As to
\par seeing, we may presume the opposite, but in any case we must try to keep
\par in the shade behind the tree-trunks.  The slightest error would be fatal
\par to us."
\par 
\par Adam only nodded, in case there should be any chance of the monster
\par seeing the movement.
\par 
\par After a time that seemed interminable, they emerged from the circling
\par wood.  It was like coming out into sunlight by comparison with the misty
\par blackness which had been around them.  There was light enough to see by,
\par though not sufficient to distinguish things at a distance.  Adam's eyes
\par sought the green light in the sky.  It was still in about the same place,
\par but its surroundings were more visible.  It was now at the summit of what
\par seemed to be a long white pole, near the top of which were two pendant
\par white masses, like rudimentary arms or fins.  The green light, strangely
\par enough, did not seem lessened by the surrounding starlight, but had a
\par clearer effect and a deeper green.  Whilst they were carefully regarding
\par this--Adam with the aid of an opera-glass--their nostrils were assailed
\par by a horrid stench, something like that which rose from the well-hole in
\par Diana's Grove.
\par 
\par By degrees, as their eyes got the right focus, they saw an immense
\par towering mass that seemed snowy white.  It was tall and thin.  The lower
\par part was hidden by the trees which lay between, but they could follow the
\par tall white shaft and the duplicate green lights which topped it.  As they
\par looked there was a movement--the shaft seemed to bend, and the line of
\par green light descended amongst the trees.  They could see the green light
\par twinkle as it passed between the obstructing branches.
\par 
\par Seeing where the head of the monster was, the two men ventured a little
\par further forward, and saw that the hidden mass at the base of the shaft
\par was composed of vast coils of the great serpent's body, forming a base
\par from which the upright mass rose.  As they looked, this lower mass moved,
\par the glistening folds catching the moonlight, and they could see that the
\par monster's progress was along the ground.  It was coming towards them at a
\par swift pace, so they turned and ran, taking care to make as little noise
\par as possible, either by their footfalls or by disturbing the undergrowth
\par close to them.  They did not stop or pause till they saw before them the
\par high dark tower of Doom.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXIII--IN THE ENEMY'S HOUSE
\par 
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel was in the library next morning, after breakfast, when Adam
\par came to him carrying a letter.
\par 
\par "Her ladyship doesn't lose any time.  She has begun work already!"
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel, who was writing at a table near the window, looked up.
\par 
\par "What is it?" said he.
\par 
\par Adam held out the letter he was carrying.  It was in a blazoned envelope.
\par 
\par "Ha!" said Sir Nathaniel, "from the White Worm!  I expected something of
\par the kind."
\par 
\par "But," said Adam, "how could she have known we were here?  She didn't
\par know last night."
\par 
\par "I don't think we need trouble about that, Adam.  There is so much we do
\par not understand.  This is only another mystery.  Suffice it that she does
\par know--perhaps it is all the better and safer for us."
\par 
\par "How is that?" asked Adam with a puzzled look.
\par 
\par "General process of reasoning, my boy; and the experience of some years
\par in the diplomatic world.  This creature is a monster without heart or
\par consideration for anything or anyone.  She is not nearly so dangerous in
\par the open as when she has the dark to protect her.  Besides, we know, by
\par our own experience of her movements, that for some reason she shuns
\par publicity.  In spite of her vast bulk and abnormal strength, she is
\par afraid to attack openly.  After all, she is only a snake and with a
\par snake's nature, which is to keep low and squirm, and proceed by stealth
\par and cunning.  She will never attack when she can run away, although she
\par knows well that running away would probably be fatal to her.  What is the
\par letter about?"
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel's voice was calm and self-possessed.  When he was engaged
\par in any struggle of wits he was all diplomatist.
\par 
\par "She asks Mimi and me to tea this afternoon at Diana's Grove, and hopes
\par that you also will favour her."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel smiled.
\par 
\par "Please ask Mrs. Salton to accept for us all."
\par 
\par "She means some deadly mischief.  Surely--surely it would be wiser not."
\par 
\par "It is an old trick that we learn early in diplomacy, Adam--to fight on
\par ground of your own choice.  It is true that she suggested the place on
\par this occasion; but by accepting it we make it ours.  Moreover, she will
\par not be able to understand our reason for doing so, and her own bad
\par conscience--if she has any, bad or good--and her own fears and doubts
\par will play our game for us.  No, my dear boy, let us accept, by all
\par means."
\par 
\par Adam said nothing, but silently held out his hand, which his companion
\par shook: no words were necessary.
\par 
\par When it was getting near tea-time, Mimi asked Sir Nathaniel how they were
\par going.
\par 
\par "We must make a point of going in state.  We want all possible
\par publicity."  Mimi looked at him inquiringly.  "Certainly, my dear, in the
\par present circumstances publicity is a part of safety.  Do not be surprised
\par if, whilst we are at Diana's Grove, occasional messages come for you--for
\par all or any of us."
\par 
\par "I see!" said Mrs. Salton.  "You are taking no chances."
\par 
\par "None, my dear.  All I have learned at foreign courts, and amongst
\par civilised and uncivilised people, is going to be utilised within the next
\par couple of hours."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel's voice was full of seriousness, and it brought to Mimi in
\par a convincing way the awful gravity of the occasion.
\par 
\par In due course, they set out in a carriage drawn by a fine pair of horses,
\par who soon devoured the few miles of their journey.  Before they came to
\par the gate, Sir Nathaniel turned to Mimi.
\par 
\par "I have arranged with Adam certain signals which may be necessary if
\par certain eventualities occur.  These need be nothing to do with you
\par directly.  But bear in mind that if I ask you or Adam to do anything, do
\par not lose a second in the doing of it.  We must try to pass off such
\par moments with an appearance of unconcern.  In all probability, nothing
\par requiring such care will occur.  The White Worm will not try force,
\par though she has so much of it to spare.  Whatever she may attempt to-day,
\par of harm to any of us, will be in the way of secret plot.  Some other time
\par she may try force, but--if I am able to judge such a thing--not to-day.
\par The messengers who may ask for any of us will not be witnesses only, they
\par may help to stave off danger."  Seeing query in her face, he went on: "Of
\par what kind the danger may be, I know not, and cannot guess.  It will
\par doubtless be some ordinary circumstance; but none the less dangerous on
\par that account.  Here we are at the gate.  Now, be careful in all matters,
\par however small.  To keep your head is half the battle."
\par 
\par There were a number of men in livery in the hall when they arrived.  The
\par doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Lady Arabella came forth
\par and offered them cordial welcome.  This having been got over, Lady
\par Arabella led them into another room where tea was served.
\par 
\par Adam was acutely watchful and suspicious of everything, and saw on the
\par far side of this room a panelled iron door of the same colour and
\par configuration as the outer door of the room where was the well-hole
\par wherein Oolanga had disappeared.  Something in the sight alarmed him, and
\par he quietly stood near the door.  He made no movement, even of his eyes,
\par but he could see that Sir Nathaniel was watching him intently, and, he
\par fancied, with approval.
\par 
\par They all sat near the table spread for tea, Adam still near the door.
\par Lady Arabella fanned herself, complaining of heat, and told one of the
\par footmen to throw all the outer doors open.
\par 
\par Tea was in progress when Mimi suddenly started up with a look of fright
\par on her face; at the same moment, the men became cognisant of a thick
\par smoke which began to spread through the room--a smoke which made those
\par who experienced it gasp and choke.  The footmen began to edge uneasily
\par towards the inner door.  Denser and denser grew the smoke, and more acrid
\par its smell.  Mimi, towards whom the draught from the open door wafted the
\par smoke, rose up choking, and ran to the inner door, which she threw open
\par to its fullest extent, disclosing on the outside a curtain of thin silk,
\par fixed to the doorposts.  The draught from the open door swayed the thin
\par silk towards her, and in her fright, she tore down the curtain, which
\par enveloped her from head to foot.  Then she ran through the still open
\par door, heedless of the fact that she could not see where she was going.
\par Adam, followed by Sir Nathaniel, rushed forward and joined her--Adam
\par catching his wife by the arm and holding her tight.  It was well that he
\par did so, for just before her lay the black orifice of the well-hole,
\par which, of course, she could not see with the silk curtain round her head.
\par The floor was extremely slippery; something like thick oil had been
\par spilled where she had to pass; and close to the edge of the hole her feet
\par shot from under her, and she stumbled forward towards the well-hole.
\par 
\par When Adam saw Mimi slip, he flung himself backward, still holding her.
\par His weight told, and he dragged her up from the hole and they fell
\par together on the floor outside the zone of slipperiness.  In a moment he
\par had raised her up, and together they rushed out through the open door
\par into the sunlight, Sir Nathaniel close behind them.  They were all pale
\par except the old diplomatist, who looked both calm and cool.  It sustained
\par and cheered Adam and his wife to see him thus master of himself.  Both
\par managed to follow his example, to the wonderment of the footmen, who saw
\par the three who had just escaped a terrible danger walking together gaily,
\par as, under the guiding pressure of Sir Nathaniel's hand, they turned to re-
\par enter the house.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella, whose face had blanched to a deadly white, now resumed her
\par ministrations at the tea-board as though nothing unusual had happened.
\par The slop-basin was full of half-burned brown paper, over which tea had
\par been poured.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel had been narrowly observing his hostess, and took the first
\par opportunity afforded him of whispering to Adam:
\par 
\par "The real attack is to come--she is too quiet.  When I give my hand to
\par your wife to lead her out, come with us--and caution her to hurry.  Don't
\par lose a second, even if you have to make a scene.  Hs-s-s-h!"
\par 
\par Then they resumed their places close to the table, and the servants, in
\par obedience to Lady Arabella's order, brought in fresh tea.
\par 
\par Thence on, that tea-party seemed to Adam, whose faculties were at their
\par utmost intensity, like a terrible dream.  As for poor Mimi, she was so
\par overwrought both with present and future fear, and with horror at the
\par danger she had escaped, that her faculties were numb.  However, she was
\par braced up for a trial, and she felt assured that whatever might come she
\par would be able to go through with it.  Sir Nathaniel seemed just as
\par usual--suave, dignified, and thoughtful--perfect master of himself.
\par 
\par To her husband, it was evident that Mimi was ill at ease.  The way she
\par kept turning her head to look around her, the quick coming and going of
\par the colour of her face, her hurried breathing, alternating with periods
\par of suspicious calm, were evidences of mental perturbation.  To her, the
\par attitude of Lady Arabella seemed compounded of social sweetness and
\par personal consideration.  It would be hard to imagine more thoughtful and
\par tender kindness towards an honoured guest.
\par 
\par When tea was over and the servants had come to clear away the cups, Lady
\par Arabella, putting her arm round Mimi's waist, strolled with her into an
\par adjoining room, where she collected a number of photographs which were
\par scattered about, and, sitting down beside her guest, began to show them
\par to her.  While she was doing this, the servants closed all the doors of
\par the suite of rooms, as well as that which opened from the room
\par outside--that of the well-hole into the avenue.  Suddenly, without any
\par seeming cause, the light in the room began to grow dim.  Sir Nathaniel,
\par who was sitting close to Mimi, rose to his feet, and, crying, "Quick!"
\par caught hold of her hand and began to drag her from the room.  Adam caught
\par her other hand, and between them they drew her through the outer door
\par which the servants were beginning to close.  It was difficult at first to
\par find the way, the darkness was so great; but to their relief when Adam
\par whistled shrilly, the carriage and horses, which had been waiting in the
\par angle of the avenue, dashed up.  Her husband and Sir Nathaniel
\par lifted--almost threw--Mimi into the carriage.  The postillion plied whip
\par and spur, and the vehicle, rocking with its speed, swept through the gate
\par and tore up the road.  Behind them was a hubbub--servants rushing about,
\par orders being shouted out, doors shutting, and somewhere, seemingly far
\par back in the house, a strange noise.  Every nerve of the horses was
\par strained as they dashed recklessly along the road.  The two men held Mimi
\par between them, the arms of both of them round her as though protectingly.
\par As they went, there was a sudden rise in the ground; but the horses,
\par breathing heavily, dashed up it at racing speed, not slackening their
\par pace when the hill fell away again, leaving them to hurry along the
\par downgrade.
\par 
\par It would be foolish to say that neither Adam nor Mimi had any fear in
\par returning to Doom Tower.  Mimi felt it more keenly than her husband,
\par whose nerves were harder, and who was more inured to danger.  Still she
\par bore up bravely, and as usual the effort was helpful to her.  When once
\par she was in the study in the top of the turret, she almost forgot the
\par terrors which lay outside in the dark.  She did not attempt to peep out
\par of the window; but Adam did--and saw nothing.  The moonlight showed all
\par the surrounding country, but nowhere was to be observed that tremulous
\par line of green light.
\par 
\par The peaceful night had a good effect on them all; danger, being unseen,
\par seemed far off.  At times it was hard to realise that it had ever been.
\par With courage restored, Adam rose early and walked along the Brow, seeing
\par no change in the signs of life in Castra Regis.  What he did see, to his
\par wonder and concern, on his returning homeward, was Lady Arabella, in her
\par tight-fitting white dress and ermine collar, but without her emeralds;
\par she was emerging from the gate of Diana's Grove and walking towards the
\par Castle.  Pondering on this, and trying to find some meaning in it,
\par occupied his thoughts till he joined Mimi and Sir Nathaniel at breakfast.
\par They began the meal in silence.  What had been had been, and was known to
\par them all.  Moreover, it was not a pleasant topic.
\par 
\par A fillip was given to the conversation when Adam told of his seeing Lady
\par Arabella, on her way to Castra Regis.  They each had something to say of
\par her, and of what her wishes or intentions were towards Edgar Caswall.
\par Mimi spoke bitterly of her in every aspect.  She had not forgotten--and
\par never would--never could--the occasion when, to harm Lilla, the woman had
\par consorted even with the nigger.  As a social matter, she was disgusted
\par with her for following up the rich landowner--"throwing herself at his
\par head so shamelessly," was how she expressed it.  She was interested to
\par know that the great kite still flew from Caswall's tower.  But beyond
\par such matters she did not try to go.  The only comment she made was of
\par strongly expressed surprise at her ladyship's "cheek" in ignoring her own
\par criminal acts, and her impudence in taking it for granted that others had
\par overlooked them also.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXIV--A STARTLING PROPOSITION
\par 
\par 
\par The more Mimi thought over the late events, the more puzzled she was.
\par What did it all mean--what could it mean, except that there was an error
\par of fact somewhere.  Could it be possible that some of them--all of them
\par had been mistaken, that there had been no White Worm at all?  On either
\par side of her was a belief impossible of reception.  Not to believe in what
\par seemed apparent was to destroy the very foundations of belief . . . yet
\par in old days there had been monsters on the earth, and certainly some
\par people had believed in just such mysterious changes of identity.  It was
\par all very strange.  Just fancy how any stranger--say a doctor--would
\par regard her, if she were to tell him that she had been to a tea-party with
\par an antediluvian monster, and that they had been waited on by up-to-date
\par men-servants.
\par 
\par Adam had returned, exhilarated by his walk, and more settled in his mind
\par than he had been for some time.  Like Mimi, he had gone through the phase
\par of doubt and inability to believe in the reality of things, though it had
\par not affected him to the same extent.  The idea, however, that his wife
\par was suffering ill-effects from her terrible ordeal, braced him up.  He
\par remained with her for a time, then he sought Sir Nathaniel in order to
\par talk over the matter with him.  He knew that the calm common sense and
\par self-reliance of the old man, as well as his experience, would be helpful
\par to them all.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel had come to the conclusion that, for some reason which he
\par did not understand, Lady Arabella had changed her plans, and, for the
\par present at all events, was pacific.  He was inclined to attribute her
\par changed demeanour to the fact that her influence over Edgar Caswall was
\par so far increased, as to justify a more fixed belief in his submission to
\par her charms.
\par 
\par As a matter of fact, she had seen Caswall that morning when she visited
\par Castra Regis, and they had had a long talk together, during which the
\par possibility of their union had been discussed.  Caswall, without being
\par enthusiastic on the subject, had been courteous and attentive; as she had
\par walked back to Diana's Grove, she almost congratulated herself on her new
\par settlement in life.  That the idea was becoming fixed in her mind, was
\par shown by a letter which she wrote later in the day to Adam Salton, and
\par sent to him by hand.  It ran as follows:
\par 
\par    "DEAR MR. SALTON,
\par 
\par    "I wonder if you would kindly advise, and, if possible, help me in a
\par    matter of business.  I have been for some time trying to make up my
\par    mind to sell Diana's Grove, I have put off and put off the doing of it
\par    till now.  The place is my own property, and no one has to be
\par    consulted with regard to what I may wish to do about it.  It was
\par    bought by my late husband, Captain Adolphus Ranger March, who had
\par    another residence, The Crest, Appleby.  He acquired all rights of all
\par    kinds, including mining and sporting.  When he died, he left his whole
\par    property to me.  I shall feel leaving this place, which has become
\par    endeared to me by many sacred memories and affections--the
\par    recollection of many happy days of my young married life, and the more
\par    than happy memories of the man I loved and who loved me so much.  I
\par    should be willing to sell the place for any fair price--so long, of
\par    course, as the purchaser was one I liked and of whom I approved.  May
\par    I say that you yourself would be the ideal person.  But I dare not
\par    hope for so much.  It strikes me, however, that among your Australian
\par    friends may be someone who wishes to make a settlement in the Old
\par    Country, and would care to fix the spot in one of the most historic
\par    regions in England, full of romance and legend, and with a
\par    never-ending vista of historical interest--an estate which, though
\par    small, is in perfect condition and with illimitable possibilities of
\par    development, and many doubtful--or unsettled--rights which have
\par    existed before the time of the Romans or even Celts, who were the
\par    original possessors.  In addition, the house has been kept up to the
\par    _dernier cri_.  Immediate possession can be arranged.  My lawyers can
\par    provide you, or whoever you may suggest, with all business and
\par    historical details.  A word from you of acceptance or refusal is all
\par    that is necessary, and we can leave details to be thrashed out by our
\par    agents.  Forgive me, won't you, for troubling you in the matter, and
\par    believe me, yours very sincerely.
\par 
\par    "ARABELLA MARCH."
\par 
\par Adam read this over several times, and then, his mind being made up, he
\par went to Mimi and asked if she had any objection.  She answered--after a
\par shudder--that she was, in this, as in all things, willing to do whatever
\par he might wish.
\par 
\par "Dearest, I am willing that you should judge what is best for us.  Be
\par quite free to act as you see your duty, and as your inclination calls.  We
\par are in the hands of God, and He has hitherto guided us, and will do so to
\par His own end."
\par 
\par From his wife's room Adam Salton went straight to the study in the tower,
\par where he knew Sir Nathaniel would be at that hour.  The old man was
\par alone, so, when he had entered in obedience to the "Come in," which
\par answered his query, he closed the door and sat down beside him.
\par 
\par "Do you think, sir, that it would be well for me to buy Diana's Grove?"
\par 
\par "God bless my soul!" said the old man, startled, "why on earth would you
\par want to do that?"
\par 
\par "Well, I have vowed to destroy that White Worm, and my being able to do
\par whatever I may choose with the Lair would facilitate matters and avoid
\par complications."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel hesitated longer than usual before speaking.  He was
\par thinking deeply.
\par 
\par "Yes, Adam, there is much common sense in your suggestion, though it
\par startled me at first.  I think that, for all reasons, you would do well
\par to buy the property and to have the conveyance settled at once.  If you
\par want more money than is immediately convenient, let me know, so that I
\par may be your banker."
\par 
\par "Thank you, sir, most heartily; but I have more money at immediate call
\par than I shall want.  I am glad you approve."
\par 
\par "The property is historic, and as time goes on it will increase in value.
\par Moreover, I may tell you something, which indeed is only a surmise, but
\par which, if I am right, will add great value to the place."  Adam listened.
\par "Has it ever struck you why the old name, 'The Lair of the White Worm,'
\par was given?  We know that there was a snake which in early days was called
\par a worm; but why white?"
\par 
\par "I really don't know, sir; I never thought of it.  I simply took it for
\par granted."
\par 
\par "So did I at first--long ago.  But later I puzzled my brain for a
\par reason."
\par 
\par "And what was the reason, sir?"
\par 
\par "Simply and solely because the snake or worm _was_ white.  We are near
\par the county of Stafford, where the great industry of china-burning was
\par originated and grew.  Stafford owes much of its wealth to the large
\par deposits of the rare china clay found in it from time to time.  These
\par deposits become in time pretty well exhausted; but for centuries Stafford
\par adventurers looked for the special clay, as Ohio and Pennsylvania farmers
\par and explorers looked for oil.  Anyone owning real estate on which china
\par clay can be discovered strikes a sort of gold mine."
\par 
\par "Yes, and then--"  The young man looked puzzled.
\par 
\par "The original 'Worm' so-called, from which the name of the place came,
\par had to find a direct way down to the marshes and the mud-holes.  Now, the
\par clay is easily penetrable, and the original hole probably pierced a bed
\par of china clay.  When once the way was made it would become a sort of
\par highway for the Worm.  But as much movement was necessary to ascend such
\par a great height, some of the clay would become attached to its rough skin
\par by attrition.  The downway must have been easy work, but the ascent was
\par different, and when the monster came to view in the upper world, it would
\par be fresh from contact with the white clay.  Hence the name, which has no
\par cryptic significance, but only fact.  Now, if that surmise be true--and I
\par do not see why not--there must be a deposit of valuable clay--possibly of
\par immense depth."
\par 
\par Adam's comment pleased the old gentleman.
\par 
\par "I have it in my bones, sir, that you have struck--or rather reasoned
\par out--a great truth."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel went on cheerfully.  "When the world of commerce wakes up
\par to the value of your find, it will be as well that your title to
\par ownership has been perfectly secured.  If anyone ever deserved such a
\par gain, it is you."
\par 
\par With his friend's aid, Adam secured the property without loss of time.
\par Then he went to see his uncle, and told him about it.  Mr. Salton was
\par delighted to find his young relative already constructively the owner of
\par so fine an estate--one which gave him an important status in the county.
\par He made many anxious enquiries about Mimi, and the doings of the White
\par Worm, but Adam reassured him.
\par 
\par The next morning, when Adam went to his host in the smoking-room, Sir
\par Nathaniel asked him how he purposed to proceed with regard to keeping his
\par vow.
\par 
\par "It is a difficult matter which you have undertaken.  To destroy such a
\par monster is something like one of the labours of Hercules, in that not
\par only its size and weight and power of using them in little-known ways are
\par against you, but the occult side is alone an unsurpassable difficulty.
\par The Worm is already master of all the elements except fire--and I do not
\par see how fire can be used for the attack.  It has only to sink into the
\par earth in its usual way, and you could not overtake it if you had the
\par resources of the biggest coal-mine in existence.  But I daresay you have
\par mapped out some plan in your mind," he added courteously.
\par 
\par "I have, sir.  But, of course, it may not stand the test of practice."
\par 
\par "May I know the idea?"
\par 
\par "Well, sir, this was my argument: At the time of the Chartist trouble, an
\par idea spread amongst financial circles that an attack was going to be made
\par on the Bank of England.  Accordingly, the directors of that institution
\par consulted many persons who were supposed to know what steps should be
\par taken, and it was finally decided that the best protection against
\par fire--which is what was feared--was not water but sand.  To carry the
\par scheme into practice great store of fine sea-sand--the kind that blows
\par about and is used to fill hour-glasses--was provided throughout the
\par building, especially at the points liable to attack, from which it could
\par be brought into use.
\par 
\par "I propose to provide at Diana's Grove, as soon as it comes into my
\par possession, an enormous amount of such sand, and shall take an early
\par occasion of pouring it into the well-hole, which it will in time choke.
\par Thus Lady Arabella, in her guise of the White Worm, will find herself cut
\par off from her refuge.  The hole is a narrow one, and is some hundreds of
\par feet deep.  The weight of the sand this can contain would not in itself
\par be sufficient to obstruct; but the friction of such a body working up
\par against it would be tremendous."
\par 
\par "One moment.  What use would the sand be for destruction?"
\par 
\par "None, directly; but it would hold the struggling body in place till the
\par rest of my scheme came into practice."
\par 
\par "And what is the rest?"
\par 
\par "As the sand is being poured into the well-hole, quantities of dynamite
\par can also be thrown in!"
\par 
\par "Good.  But how would the dynamite explode--for, of course, that is what
\par you intend.  Would not some sort of wire or fuse he required for each
\par parcel of dynamite?"
\par 
\par Adam smiled.
\par 
\par "Not in these days, sir.  That was proved in New York.  A thousand pounds
\par of dynamite, in sealed canisters, was placed about some workings.  At the
\par last a charge of gunpowder was fired, and the concussion exploded the
\par dynamite.  It was most successful.  Those who were non-experts in high
\par explosives expected that every pane of glass in New York would be
\par shattered.  But, in reality, the explosive did no harm outside the area
\par intended, although sixteen acres of rock had been mined and only the
\par supporting walls and pillars had been left intact.  The whole of the
\par rocks were shattered."
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel nodded approval.
\par 
\par "That seems a good plan--a very excellent one.  But if it has to tear
\par down so many feet of precipice, it may wreck the whole neighbourhood."
\par 
\par "And free it for ever from a monster," added Adam, as he left the room to
\par find his wife.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXV--THE LAST BATTLE
\par 
\par 
\par Lady Arabella had instructed her solicitors to hurry on with the
\par conveyance of Diana's Grove, so no time was lost in letting Adam Salton
\par have formal possession of the estate.  After his interview with Sir
\par Nathaniel, he had taken steps to begin putting his plan into action.  In
\par order to accumulate the necessary amount of fine sea-sand, he ordered the
\par steward to prepare for an elaborate system of top-dressing all the
\par grounds.  A great heap of the sand, brought from bays on the Welsh coast,
\par began to grow at the back of the Grove.  No one seemed to suspect that it
\par was there for any purpose other than what had been given out.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella, who alone could have guessed, was now so absorbed in her
\par matrimonial pursuit of Edgar Caswall, that she had neither time nor
\par inclination for thought extraneous to this.  She had not yet moved from
\par the house, though she had formally handed over the estate.
\par 
\par Adam put up a rough corrugated-iron shed behind the Grove, in which he
\par stored his explosives.  All being ready for his great attempt whenever
\par the time should come, he was now content to wait, and, in order to pass
\par the time, interested himself in other things--even in Caswall's great
\par kite, which still flew from the high tower of Castra Regis.
\par 
\par The mound of fine sand grew to proportions so vast as to puzzle the
\par bailiffs and farmers round the Brow.  The hour of the intended cataclysm
\par was approaching apace.  Adam wished--but in vain--for an opportunity,
\par which would appear to be natural, of visiting Caswall in the turret of
\par Castra Regis.  At last, one morning, he met Lady Arabella moving towards
\par the Castle, so he took his courage _a deux mains_ and asked to be allowed
\par to accompany her.  She was glad, for her own purposes, to comply with his
\par wishes.  So together they entered, and found their way to the
\par turret-room.  Caswall was much surprised to see Adam come to his house,
\par but lent himself to the task of seeming to be pleased.  He played the
\par host so well as to deceive even Adam.  They all went out on the turret
\par roof, where he explained to his guests the mechanism for raising and
\par lowering the kite, taking also the opportunity of testing the movements
\par of the multitudes of birds, how they answered almost instantaneously to
\par the lowering or raising of the kite.
\par 
\par As Lady Arabella walked home with Adam from Castra Regis, she asked him
\par if she might make a request.  Permission having been accorded, she
\par explained that before she finally left Diana's Grove, where she had lived
\par so long, she had a desire to know the depth of the well-hole.  Adam was
\par really happy to meet her wishes, not from any sentiment, but because he
\par wished to give some valid and ostensible reason for examining the passage
\par of the Worm, which would obviate any suspicion resulting from his being
\par on the premises.  He brought from London a Kelvin sounding apparatus,
\par with a sufficient length of piano-wire for testing any probable depth.
\par The wire passed easily over the running wheel, and when this was once
\par fixed over the hole, he was satisfied to wait till the most advantageous
\par time for his final experiment.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par In the meantime, affairs had been going quietly at Mercy Farm.  Lilla, of
\par course, felt lonely in the absence of her cousin, but the even tenor of
\par life went on for her as for others.  After the first shock of parting was
\par over, things went back to their accustomed routine.  In one respect,
\par however, there was a marked difference.  So long as home conditions had
\par remained unchanged, Lilla was content to put ambition far from her, and
\par to settle down to the life which had been hers as long as she could
\par remember.  But Mimi's marriage set her thinking; naturally, she came to
\par the conclusion that she too might have a mate.  There was not for her
\par much choice--there was little movement in the matrimonial direction at
\par the farmhouse.  She did not approve of the personality of Edgar Caswall,
\par and his struggle with Mimi had frightened her; but he was unmistakably an
\par excellent _parti_, much better than she could have any right to expect.
\par This weighs much with a woman, and more particularly one of her class.
\par So, on the whole, she was content to let things take their course, and to
\par abide by the issue.
\par 
\par As time went on, she had reason to believe that things did not point to
\par happiness.  She could not shut her eyes to certain disturbing facts,
\par amongst which were the existence of Lady Arabella and her growing
\par intimacy with Edgar Caswall; as well as his own cold and haughty nature,
\par so little in accord with the ardour which is the foundation of a young
\par maid's dreams of happiness.  How things would, of necessity, alter if she
\par were to marry, she was afraid to think.  All told, the prospect was not
\par happy for her, and she had a secret longing that something might occur to
\par upset the order of things as at present arranged.
\par 
\par When Lilla received a note from Edgar Caswall asking if he might come to
\par tea on the following afternoon, her heart sank within her.  If it was
\par only for her father's sake, she must not refuse him or show any
\par disinclination which he might construe into incivility.  She missed Mimi
\par more than she could say or even dared to think.  Hitherto, she had always
\par looked to her cousin for sympathy, for understanding, for loyal support.
\par Now she and all these things, and a thousand others--gentle, assuring,
\par supporting--were gone.  And instead there was a horrible aching void.
\par 
\par For the whole afternoon and evening, and for the following forenoon, poor
\par Lilla's loneliness grew to be a positive agony.  For the first time she
\par began to realise the sense of her loss, as though all the previous
\par suffering had been merely a preparation.  Everything she looked at,
\par everything she remembered or thought of, became laden with poignant
\par memory.  Then on the top of all was a new sense of dread.  The reaction
\par from the sense of security, which had surrounded her all her life, to a
\par never-quieted apprehension, was at times almost more than she could bear.
\par It so filled her with fear that she had a haunting feeling that she would
\par as soon die as live.  However, whatever might be her own feelings, duty
\par had to be done, and as she had been brought up to consider duty first,
\par she braced herself to go through, to the very best of her ability, what
\par was before her.
\par 
\par Still, the severe and prolonged struggle for self-control told upon
\par Lilla.  She looked, as she felt, ill and weak.  She was really in a
\par nerveless and prostrate condition, with black circles round her eyes,
\par pale even to her lips, and with an instinctive trembling which she was
\par quite unable to repress.  It was for her a sad mischance that Mimi was
\par away, for her love would have seen through all obscuring causes, and have
\par brought to light the girl's unhappy condition of health.  Lilla was
\par utterly unable to do anything to escape from the ordeal before her; but
\par her cousin, with the experience of her former struggles with Mr. Caswall
\par and of the condition in which these left her, would have taken steps--even
\par peremptory ones, if necessary--to prevent a repetition.
\par 
\par Edgar arrived punctually to the time appointed by herself.  When Lilla,
\par through the great window, saw him approaching the house, her condition of
\par nervous upset was pitiable.  She braced herself up, however, and managed
\par to get through the interview in its preliminary stages without any
\par perceptible change in her normal appearance and bearing.  It had been to
\par her an added terror that the black shadow of Oolanga, whom she dreaded,
\par would follow hard on his master.  A load was lifted from her mind when he
\par did not make his usual stealthy approach.  She had also feared, though in
\par lesser degree, lest Lady Arabella should be present to make trouble for
\par her as before.
\par 
\par With a woman's natural forethought in a difficult position, she had
\par provided the furnishing of the tea-table as a subtle indication of the
\par social difference between her and her guest.  She had chosen the
\par implements of service, as well as all the provender set forth, of the
\par humblest kind.  Instead of arranging the silver teapot and china cups,
\par she had set out an earthen teapot, such as was in common use in the farm
\par kitchen.  The same idea was carried out in the cups and saucers of thick
\par homely delft, and in the cream-jug of similar kind.  The bread was of
\par simple whole-meal, home-baked.  The butter was good, since she had made
\par it herself, while the preserves and honey came from her own garden.  Her
\par face beamed with satisfaction when the guest eyed the appointments with a
\par supercilious glance.  It was a shock to the poor girl herself, for she
\par enjoyed offering to a guest the little hospitalities possible to her; but
\par that had to be sacrificed with other pleasures.
\par 
\par Caswall's face was more set and iron-clad than ever--his piercing eyes
\par seemed from the very beginning to look her through and through.  Her
\par heart quailed when she thought of what would follow--of what would be the
\par end, when this was only the beginning.  As some protection, though it
\par could be only of a sentimental kind, she brought from her own room the
\par photographs of Mimi, of her grandfather, and of Adam Salton, whom by now
\par she had grown to look on with reliance, as a brother whom she could
\par trust.  She kept the pictures near her heart, to which her hand naturally
\par strayed when her feelings of constraint, distrust, or fear became so
\par poignant as to interfere with the calm which she felt was necessary to
\par help her through her ordeal.
\par 
\par At first Edgar Caswall was courteous and polite, even thoughtful; but
\par after a little while, when he found her resistance to his domination
\par grow, he abandoned all forms of self-control and appeared in the same
\par dominance as he had previously shown.  She was prepared, however, for
\par this, both by her former experience and the natural fighting instinct
\par within her.  By this means, as the minutes went on, both developed the
\par power and preserved the equality in which they had begun.
\par 
\par Without warning, the psychic battle between the two individualities began
\par afresh.  This time both the positive and negative causes were all in
\par favour of the man.  The woman was alone and in bad spirits, unsupported;
\par nothing at all was in her favour except the memory of the two victorious
\par contests; whereas the man, though unaided, as before, by either Lady
\par Arabella or Oolanga, was in full strength, well rested, and in
\par flourishing circumstances.  It was not, therefore, to be wondered at that
\par his native dominance of character had full opportunity of asserting
\par itself.  He began his preliminary stare with a conscious sense of power,
\par and, as it appeared to have immediate effect on the girl, he felt an ever-
\par growing conviction of ultimate victory.
\par 
\par After a little Lilla's resolution began to flag.  She felt that the
\par contest was unequal--that she was unable to put forth her best efforts.
\par As she was an unselfish person, she could not fight so well in her own
\par battle as in that of someone whom she loved and to whom she was devoted.
\par Edgar saw the relaxing of the muscles of face and brow, and the almost
\par collapse of the heavy eyelids which seemed tumbling downward in sleep.
\par Lilla made gallant efforts to brace her dwindling powers, but for a time
\par unsuccessfully.  At length there came an interruption, which seemed like
\par a powerful stimulant.  Through the wide window she saw Lady Arabella
\par enter the plain gateway of the farm, and advance towards the hall door.
\par She was clad as usual in tight-fitting white, which accentuated her thin,
\par sinuous figure.
\par 
\par The sight did for Lilla what no voluntary effort could have done.  Her
\par eyes flashed, and in an instant she felt as though a new life had
\par suddenly developed within her.  Lady Arabella's entry, in her usual
\par unconcerned, haughty, supercilious way, heightened the effect, so that
\par when the two stood close to each other battle was joined.  Mr. Caswall,
\par too, took new courage from her coming, and all his masterfulness and
\par power came back to him.  His looks, intensified, had more obvious effect
\par than had been noticeable that day.  Lilla seemed at last overcome by his
\par dominance.  Her face became red and pale--violently red and ghastly
\par pale--by rapid turns.  Her strength seemed gone.  Her knees collapsed,
\par and she was actually sinking on the floor, when to her surprise and joy
\par Mimi came into the room, running hurriedly and breathing heavily.
\par 
\par Lilla rushed to her, and the two clasped hands.  With that, a new sense
\par of power, greater than Lilla had ever seen in her, seemed to quicken her
\par cousin.  Her hand swept the air in front of Edgar Caswall, seeming to
\par drive him backward more and more by each movement, till at last he seemed
\par to be actually hurled through the door which Mimi's entrance had left
\par open, and fell at full length on the gravel path without.
\par 
\par Then came the final and complete collapse of Lilla, who, without a sound,
\par sank down on the floor.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXVI--FACE TO FACE
\par 
\par 
\par Mimi was greatly distressed when she saw her cousin lying prone.  She had
\par a few times in her life seen Lilla on the verge of fainting, but never
\par senseless; and now she was frightened.  She threw herself on her knees
\par beside Lilla, and tried, by rubbing her hands and other measures commonly
\par known, to restore her.  But all her efforts were unavailing.  Lilla still
\par lay white and senseless.  In fact, each moment she looked worse; her
\par breast, that had been heaving with the stress, became still, and the
\par pallor of her face grew like marble.
\par 
\par At these succeeding changes Mimi's fright grew, till it altogether
\par mastered her.  She succeeded in controlling herself only to the extent
\par that she did not scream.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella had followed Caswall, when he had recovered sufficiently to
\par get up and walk--though stumblingly--in the direction of Castra Regis.
\par When Mimi was quite alone with Lilla and the need for effort had ceased,
\par she felt weak and trembled.  In her own mind, she attributed it to a
\par sudden change in the weather--it was momentarily becoming apparent that a
\par storm was coming on.
\par 
\par She raised Lilla's head and laid it on her warm young breast, but all in
\par vain.  The cold of the white features thrilled through her, and she
\par utterly collapsed when it was borne in on her that Lilla had passed away.
\par 
\par The dusk gradually deepened and the shades of evening closed in, but Mimi
\par did not seem to notice or to care.  She sat on the floor with her arms
\par round the body of the girl whom she loved.  Darker and blacker grew the
\par sky as the coming storm and the closing night joined forces.  Still she
\par sat on--alone--tearless--unable to think.  Mimi did not know how long she
\par sat there.  Though it seemed to her that ages had passed, it could not
\par have been more than half-an-hour.  She suddenly came to herself, and was
\par surprised to find that her grandfather had not returned.  For a while she
\par lay quiet, thinking of the immediate past.  Lilla's hand was still in
\par hers, and to her surprise it was still warm.  Somehow this helped her
\par consciousness, and without any special act of will she stood up.  She lit
\par a lamp and looked at her cousin.  There was no doubt that Lilla was dead;
\par but when the lamp-light fell on her eyes, they seemed to look at Mimi
\par with intent--with meaning.  In this state of dark isolation a new
\par resolution came to her, and grew and grew until it became a fixed
\par definite purpose.  She would face Caswall and call him to account for his
\par murder of Lilla--that was what she called it to herself.  She would also
\par take steps--she knew not what or how--to avenge the part taken by Lady
\par Arabella.
\par 
\par In this frame of mind she lit all the lamps in the room, got water and
\par linen from her room, and set about the decent ordering of Lilla's body.
\par This took some time; but when it was finished, she put on her hat and
\par cloak, put out the lights, and set out quietly for Castra Regis.
\par 
\par As Mimi drew near the Castle, she saw no lights except those in and
\par around the tower room.  The lights showed her that Mr. Caswall was there,
\par so she entered by the hall door, which as usual was open, and felt her
\par way in the darkness up the staircase to the lobby of the room.  The door
\par was ajar, and the light from within showed brilliantly through the
\par opening.  She saw Edgar Caswall walking restlessly to and fro in the
\par room, with his hands clasped behind his back.  She opened the door
\par without knocking, and walked right into the room.  As she entered, he
\par ceased walking, and stared at her in surprise.  She made no remark, no
\par comment, but continued the fixed look which he had seen on her entrance.
\par 
\par For a time silence reigned, and the two stood looking fixedly at each
\par other.  Mimi was the first to speak.
\par 
\par "You murderer!  Lilla is dead!"
\par 
\par "Dead!  Good God!  When did she die?"
\par 
\par "She died this afternoon, just after you left her."
\par 
\par "Are you sure?"
\par 
\par "Yes--and so are you--or you ought to be.  You killed her!"
\par 
\par "I killed her!  Be careful what you say!"
\par 
\par "As God sees us, it is true; and you know it.  You came to Mercy Farm on
\par purpose to break her--if you could.  And the accomplice of your guilt,
\par Lady Arabella March, came for the same purpose."
\par 
\par "Be careful, woman," he said hotly.  "Do not use such names in that way,
\par or you shall suffer for it."
\par 
\par "I am suffering for it--have suffered for it--shall suffer for it.  Not
\par for speaking the truth as I have done, but because you two, with devilish
\par malignity, did my darling to death.  It is you and your accomplice who
\par have to dread punishment, not I."
\par 
\par "Take care!" he said again.
\par 
\par "Oh, I am not afraid of you or your accomplice," she answered spiritedly.
\par "I am content to stand by every word I have said, every act I have done.
\par Moreover, I believe in God's justice.  I fear not the grinding of His
\par mills; if necessary I shall set the wheels in motion myself.  But you
\par don't care for God, or believe in Him.  Your god is your great kite,
\par which cows the birds of a whole district.  But be sure that His hand,
\par when it rises, always falls at the appointed time.  It may be that your
\par name is being called even at this very moment at the Great Assize.  Repent
\par while there is still time.  Happy you, if you may be allowed to enter
\par those mighty halls in the company of the pure-souled angel whose voice
\par has only to whisper one word of justice, and you disappear for ever into
\par everlasting torment."
\par 
\par The sudden death of Lilla caused consternation among Mimi's friends and
\par well-wishers.  Such a tragedy was totally unexpected, as Adam and Sir
\par Nathaniel had been expecting the White Worm's vengeance to fall upon
\par themselves.
\par 
\par Adam, leaving his wife free to follow her own desires with regard to
\par Lilla and her grandfather, busied himself with filling the well-hole with
\par the fine sand prepared for the purpose, taking care to have lowered at
\par stated intervals quantities of the store of dynamite, so as to be ready
\par for the final explosion.  He had under his immediate supervision a corps
\par of workmen, and was assisted by Sir Nathaniel, who had come over for the
\par purpose, and all were now staying at Lesser Hill.
\par 
\par Mr. Salton, too, showed much interest in the job, and was constantly
\par coming in and out, nothing escaping his observation.
\par 
\par Since her marriage to Adam and their coming to stay at Doom Tower, Mimi
\par had been fettered by fear of the horrible monster at Diana's Grove.  But
\par now she dreaded it no longer.  She accepted the fact of its assuming at
\par will the form of Lady Arabella.  She had still to tax and upbraid her for
\par her part in the unhappiness which had been wrought on Lilla, and for her
\par share in causing her death.
\par 
\par One evening, when Mimi entered her own room, she went to the window and
\par threw an eager look round the whole circle of sight.  A single glance
\par satisfied her that the White Worm in _propria persona_ was not visible.
\par So she sat down in the window-seat and enjoyed the pleasure of a full
\par view, from which she had been so long cut off.  The maid who waited on
\par her had told her that Mr. Salton had not yet returned home, so she felt
\par free to enjoy the luxury of peace and quiet.
\par 
\par As she looked out of the window, she saw something thin and white move
\par along the avenue.  She thought she recognised the figure of Lady
\par Arabella, and instinctively drew back behind the curtain.  When she had
\par ascertained, by peeping out several times, that the lady had not seen
\par her, she watched more carefully, all her instinctive hatred flooding back
\par at the sight of her.  Lady Arabella was moving swiftly and stealthily,
\par looking back and around her at intervals, as if she feared to be
\par followed.  This gave Mimi an idea that she was up to no good, so she
\par determined to seize the occasion for watching her in more detail.
\par 
\par Hastily putting on a dark cloak and hat, she ran downstairs and out into
\par the avenue.  Lady Arabella had moved, but the sheen of her white dress
\par was still to be seen among the young oaks around the gateway.  Keeping in
\par shadow, Mimi followed, taking care not to come so close as to awake the
\par other's suspicion, and watched her quarry pass along the road in the
\par direction of Castra Regis.
\par 
\par She followed on steadily through the gloom of the trees, depending on the
\par glint of the white dress to keep her right.  The wood began to thicken,
\par and presently, when the road widened and the trees grew farther back, she
\par lost sight of any indication of her whereabouts.  Under the present
\par conditions it was impossible for her to do any more, so, after waiting
\par for a while, still hidden in the shadow to see if she could catch another
\par glimpse of the white frock, she determined to go on slowly towards Castra
\par Regis, and trust to the chapter of accidents to pick up the trail again.
\par She went on slowly, taking advantage of every obstacle and shadow to keep
\par herself concealed.
\par 
\par At last she entered on the grounds of the Castle, at a spot from which
\par the windows of the turret were dimly visible, without having seen again
\par any sign of Lady Arabella.
\par 
\par Meanwhile, during most of the time that Mimi Salton had been moving
\par warily along in the gloom, she was in reality being followed by Lady
\par Arabella, who had caught sight of her leaving the house and had never
\par again lost touch with her.  It was a case of the hunter being hunted.  For
\par a time Mimi's many turnings, with the natural obstacles that were
\par perpetually intervening, caused Lady Arabella some trouble; but when she
\par was close to Castra Regis, there was no more possibility of concealment,
\par and the strange double following went swiftly on.
\par 
\par When she saw Mimi close to the hall door of Castra Regis and ascending
\par the steps, she followed.  When Mimi entered the dark hall and felt her
\par way up the staircase, still, as she believed, following Lady Arabella,
\par the latter kept on her way.  When they reached the lobby of the turret-
\par rooms, Mimi believed that the object of her search was ahead of her.
\par 
\par Edgar Caswall sat in the gloom of the great room, occasionally stirred to
\par curiosity when the drifting clouds allowed a little light to fall from
\par the storm-swept sky.  But nothing really interested him now.  Since he
\par had heard of Lilla's death, the gloom of his remorse, emphasised by
\par Mimi's upbraiding, had made more hopeless his cruel, selfish, saturnine
\par nature.  He heard no sound, for his normal faculties seemed benumbed.
\par 
\par Mimi, when she came to the door, which stood ajar, gave a light tap.  So
\par light was it that it did not reach Caswall's ears.  Then, taking her
\par courage in both hands, she boldly pushed the door and entered.  As she
\par did so, her heart sank, for now she was face to face with a difficulty
\par which had not, in her state of mental perturbation, occurred to her.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXVII--ON THE TURRET ROOF
\par 
\par 
\par The storm which was coming was already making itself manifest, not only
\par in the wide scope of nature, but in the hearts and natures of human
\par beings.  Electrical disturbance in the sky and the air is reproduced in
\par animals of all kinds, and particularly in the highest type of them
\par all--the most receptive--the most electrical.  So it was with Edgar
\par Caswall, despite his selfish nature and coldness of blood.  So it was
\par with Mimi Salton, despite her unselfish, unchanging devotion for those
\par she loved.  So it was even with Lady Arabella, who, under the instincts
\par of a primeval serpent, carried the ever-varying wishes and customs of
\par womanhood, which is always old--and always new.
\par 
\par Edgar, after he had turned his eyes on Mimi, resumed his apathetic
\par position and sullen silence.  Mimi quietly took a seat a little way
\par apart, whence she could look on the progress of the coming storm and
\par study its appearance throughout the whole visible circle of the
\par neighbourhood.  She was in brighter and better spirits than she had been
\par for many days past.  Lady Arabella tried to efface herself behind the now
\par open door.
\par 
\par Without, the clouds grew thicker and blacker as the storm-centre came
\par closer.  As yet the forces, from whose linking the lightning springs,
\par were held apart, and the silence of nature proclaimed the calm before the
\par storm.  Caswall felt the effect of the gathering electric force.  A sort
\par of wild exultation grew upon him, such as he had sometimes felt just
\par before the breaking of a tropical storm.  As he became conscious of this,
\par he raised his head and caught sight of Mimi.  He was in the grip of an
\par emotion greater than himself; in the mood in which he was he felt the
\par need upon him of doing some desperate deed.  He was now absolutely
\par reckless, and as Mimi was associated with him in the memory which drove
\par him on, he wished that she too should be engaged in this enterprise.  He
\par had no knowledge of the proximity of Lady Arabella, and thought that he
\par was far removed from all he knew and whose interests he shared--alone
\par with the wild elements, which were being lashed to fury, and with the
\par woman who had struggled with him and vanquished him, and on whom he would
\par shower the full measure of his hate.
\par 
\par The fact was that Edgar Caswall was, if not mad, close to the
\par border-line.  Madness in its first stage--monomania--is a lack of
\par proportion.  So long as this is general, it is not always noticeable, for
\par the uninspired onlooker is without the necessary means of comparison.  But
\par in monomania the errant faculty protrudes itself in a way that may not be
\par denied.  It puts aside, obscures, or takes the place of something
\par else--just as the head of a pin placed before the centre of the iris will
\par block out the whole scope of vision.  The most usual form of monomania
\par has commonly the same beginning as that from which Edgar Caswall
\par suffered--an over-large idea of self-importance.  Alienists, who study
\par the matter exactly, probably know more of human vanity and its effects
\par than do ordinary men.  Caswall's mental disturbance was not hard to
\par identify.  Every asylum is full of such cases--men and women, who,
\par naturally selfish and egotistical, so appraise to themselves their own
\par importance that every other circumstance in life becomes subservient to
\par it.  The disease supplies in itself the material for self-magnification.
\par When the decadence attacks a nature naturally proud and selfish and vain,
\par and lacking both the aptitude and habit of self-restraint, the
\par development of the disease is more swift, and ranges to farther limits.
\par It is such persons who become imbued with the idea that they have the
\par attributes of the Almighty--even that they themselves are the Almighty.
\par 
\par Mimi had a suspicion--or rather, perhaps, an intuition--of the true state
\par of things when she heard him speak, and at the same time noticed the
\par abnormal flush on his face, and his rolling eyes.  There was a certain
\par want of fixedness of purpose which she had certainly not noticed before--a
\par quick, spasmodic utterance which belongs rather to the insane than to
\par those of intellectual equilibrium.  She was a little frightened, not only
\par by his thoughts, but by his staccato way of expressing them.
\par 
\par Caswall moved to the door leading to the turret stair by which the roof
\par was reached, and spoke in a peremptory way, whose tone alone made her
\par feel defiant.
\par 
\par "Come!  I want you."
\par 
\par She instinctively drew back--she was not accustomed to such words, more
\par especially to such a tone.  Her answer was indicative of a new contest.
\par 
\par "Why should I go?  What for?"
\par 
\par He did not at once reply--another indication of his overwhelming egotism.
\par She repeated her questions; habit reasserted itself, and he spoke without
\par thinking the words which were in his heart.
\par 
\par "I want you, if you will be so good, to come with me to the turret roof.
\par I am much interested in certain experiments with the kite, which would
\par be, if not a pleasure, at least a novel experience to you.  You would see
\par something not easily seen otherwise."
\par 
\par "I will come," she answered simply; Edgar moved in the direction of the
\par stair, she following close behind him.
\par 
\par She did not like to be left alone at such a height, in such a place, in
\par the darkness, with a storm about to break.  Of himself she had no fear;
\par all that had been seemed to have passed away with her two victories over
\par him in the struggle of wills.  Moreover, the more recent
\par apprehension--that of his madness--had also ceased.  In the conversation
\par of the last few minutes he seemed so rational, so clear, so unaggressive,
\par that she no longer saw reason for doubt.  So satisfied was she that even
\par when he put out a hand to guide her to the steep, narrow stairway, she
\par took it without thought in the most conventional way.
\par 
\par Lady Arabella, crouching in the lobby behind the door, heard every word
\par that had been said, and formed her own opinion of it.  It seemed evident
\par to her that there had been some rapprochement between the two who had so
\par lately been hostile to each other, and that made her furiously angry.
\par Mimi was interfering with her plans!  She had made certain of her capture
\par of Edgar Caswall, and she could not tolerate even the lightest and most
\par contemptuous fancy on his part which might divert him from the main
\par issue.  When she became aware that he wished Mimi to come with him to the
\par roof and that she had acquiesced, her rage got beyond bounds.  She became
\par oblivious to any danger there might be in a visit to such an exposed
\par place at such a time, and to all lesser considerations, and made up her
\par mind to forestall them.  She stealthily and noiselessly crept through the
\par wicket, and, ascending the stair, stepped out on the roof.  It was
\par bitterly cold, for the fierce gusts of the storm which swept round the
\par turret drove in through every unimpeded way, whistling at the sharp
\par corners and singing round the trembling flagstaff.  The kite-string and
\par the wire which controlled the runners made a concourse of weird sounds
\par which somehow, perhaps from the violence which surrounded them, acting on
\par their length, resolved themselves into some kind of harmony--a fitting
\par accompaniment to the tragedy which seemed about to begin.
\par 
\par Mimi's heart beat heavily.  Just before leaving the turret-chamber she
\par had a shock which she could not shake off.  The lights of the room had
\par momentarily revealed to her, as they passed out, Edgar's face,
\par concentrated as it was whenever he intended to use his mesmeric power.
\par Now the black eyebrows made a thick line across his face, under which his
\par eyes shone and glittered ominously.  Mimi recognised the danger, and
\par assumed the defiant attitude that had twice already served her so well.
\par She had a fear that the circumstances and the place were against her, and
\par she wanted to be forearmed.
\par 
\par The sky was now somewhat lighter than it had been.  Either there was
\par lightning afar off, whose reflections were carried by the rolling clouds,
\par or else the gathered force, though not yet breaking into lightning, had
\par an incipient power of light.  It seemed to affect both the man and the
\par woman.  Edgar seemed altogether under its influence.  His spirits were
\par boisterous, his mind exalted.  He was now at his worst; madder than he
\par had been earlier in the night.
\par 
\par Mimi, trying to keep as far from him as possible, moved across the stone
\par floor of the turret roof, and found a niche which concealed her.  It was
\par not far from Lady Arabella's place of hiding.
\par 
\par Edgar, left thus alone on the centre of the turret roof, found himself
\par altogether his own master in a way which tended to increase his madness.
\par He knew that Mimi was close at hand, though he had lost sight of her.  He
\par spoke loudly, and the sound of his own voice, though it was carried from
\par him on the sweeping wind as fast as the words were spoken, seemed to
\par exalt him still more.  Even the raging of the elements round him appeared
\par to add to his exaltation.  To him it seemed that these manifestations
\par were obedient to his own will.  He had reached the sublime of his
\par madness; he was now in his own mind actually the Almighty, and whatever
\par might happen would be the direct carrying out of his own commands.  As he
\par could not see Mimi, nor fix whereabout she was, he shouted loudly:
\par 
\par "Come to me!  You shall see now what you are despising, what you are
\par warring against.  All that you see is mine--the darkness as well as the
\par light.  I tell you that I am greater than any other who is, or was, or
\par shall be.  When the Master of Evil took Christ up on a high place and
\par showed Him all the kingdoms of the earth, he was doing what he thought no
\par other could do.  He was wrong--he forgot _Me_.  I shall send you light,
\par up to the very ramparts of heaven.  A light so great that it shall
\par dissipate those black clouds that are rushing up and piling around us.
\par Look!  Look!  At the very touch of my hand that light springs into being
\par and mounts up--and up--and up!"
\par 
\par He made his way whilst he was speaking to the corner of the turret whence
\par flew the giant kite, and from which the runners ascended.  Mimi looked
\par on, appalled and afraid to speak lest she should precipitate some
\par calamity.  Within the niche Lady Arabella cowered in a paroxysm of fear.
\par 
\par Edgar took up a small wooden box, through a hole in which the wire of the
\par runner ran.  This evidently set some machinery in motion, for a sound as
\par of whirring came.  From one side of the box floated what looked like a
\par piece of stiff ribbon, which snapped and crackled as the wind took it.
\par For a few seconds Mimi saw it as it rushed along the sagging line to the
\par kite.  When close to it, there was a loud crack, and a sudden light
\par appeared to issue from every chink in the box.  Then a quick flame
\par flashed along the snapping ribbon, which glowed with an intense light--a
\par light so great that the whole of the countryside around stood out against
\par the background of black driving clouds.  For a few seconds the light
\par remained, then suddenly disappeared in the blackness around.  It was
\par simply a magnesium light, which had been fired by the mechanism within
\par the box and carried up to the kite.  Edgar was in a state of tumultuous
\par excitement, shouting and yelling at the top of his voice and dancing
\par about like a lunatic.
\par 
\par This was more than Lady Arabella's curious dual nature could stand--the
\par ghoulish element in her rose triumphant, and she abandoned all idea of
\par marriage with Edgar Caswall, gloating fiendishly over the thought of
\par revenge.
\par 
\par She must lure him to the White Worm's hole--but how?  She glanced around
\par and quickly made up her mind.  The man's whole thoughts were absorbed by
\par his wonderful kite, which he was showing off, in order to fascinate her
\par imaginary rival, Mimi.
\par 
\par On the instant she glided through the darkness to the wheel whereon the
\par string of the kite was wound.  With deft fingers she unshipped this, took
\par it with her, reeling out the wire as she went, thus keeping, in a way, in
\par touch with the kite.  Then she glided swiftly to the wicket, through
\par which she passed, locking the gate behind her as she went.
\par 
\par Down the turret stair she ran quickly, letting the wire run from the
\par wheel which she carried carefully, and, passing out of the hall door,
\par hurried down the avenue with all her speed.  She soon reached her own
\par gate, ran down the avenue, and with her key opened the iron door leading
\par to the well-hole.
\par 
\par She felt well satisfied with herself.  All her plans were maturing, or
\par had already matured.  The Master of Castra Regis was within her grasp.
\par The woman whose interference she had feared, Lilla Watford, was dead.
\par Truly, all was well, and she felt that she might pause a while and rest.
\par She tore off her clothes, with feverish fingers, and in full enjoyment of
\par her natural freedom, stretched her slim figure in animal delight.  Then
\par she lay down on the sofa--to await her victim!  Edgar Caswall's life
\par blood would more than satisfy her for some time to come.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER XXVIII--THE BREAKING OF THE STORM
\par 
\par 
\par When Lady Arabella had crept away in her usual noiseless fashion, the two
\par others remained for a while in their places on the turret roof: Caswall
\par because he had nothing to say, Mimi because she had much to say and
\par wished to put her thoughts in order.  For quite a while--which seemed
\par interminable--silence reigned between them.  At last Mimi made a
\par beginning--she had made up her mind how to act.
\par 
\par "Mr. Caswall," she said loudly, so as to make sure of being heard through
\par the blustering of the wind and the perpetual cracking of the electricity.
\par 
\par Caswall said something in reply, but his words were carried away on the
\par storm.  However, one of her objects was effected: she knew now exactly
\par whereabout on the roof he was.  So she moved close to the spot before she
\par spoke again, raising her voice almost to a shout.
\par 
\par "The wicket is shut.  Please to open it.  I can't get out."
\par 
\par As she spoke, she was quietly fingering a revolver which Adam had given
\par to her in case of emergency and which now lay in her breast.  She felt
\par that she was caged like a rat in a trap, but did not mean to be taken at
\par a disadvantage, whatever happened.  Caswall also felt trapped, and all
\par the brute in him rose to the emergency.  In a voice which was raucous and
\par brutal--much like that which is heard when a wife is being beaten by her
\par husband in a slum--he hissed out, his syllables cutting through the
\par roaring of the storm:
\par 
\par "You came of your own accord--without permission, or even asking it.  Now
\par you can stay or go as you choose.  But you must manage it for yourself;
\par I'll have nothing to do with it."
\par 
\par Her answer was spoken with dangerous suavity
\par 
\par "I am going.  Blame yourself if you do not like the time and manner of
\par it.  I daresay Adam--my husband--will have a word to say to you about
\par it!"
\par 
\par "Let him say, and be damned to him, and to you too!  I'll show you a
\par light.  You shan't be able to say that you could not see what you were
\par doing."
\par 
\par As he spoke, he was lighting another piece of the magnesium ribbon, which
\par made a blinding glare in which everything was plainly discernible, down
\par to the smallest detail.  This exactly suited Mimi.  She took accurate
\par note of the wicket and its fastening before the glare had died away.  She
\par took her revolver out and fired into the lock, which was shivered on the
\par instant, the pieces flying round in all directions, but happily without
\par causing hurt to anyone.  Then she pushed the wicket open and ran down the
\par narrow stair, and so to the hall door.  Opening this also, she ran down
\par the avenue, never lessening her speed till she stood outside the door of
\par Lesser Hill.  The door was opened at once on her ringing.
\par 
\par "Is Mr. Adam Salton in?" she asked.
\par 
\par "He has just come in, a few minutes ago.  He has gone up to the study,"
\par replied a servant.
\par 
\par She ran upstairs at once and joined him.  He seemed relieved when he saw
\par her, but scrutinised her face keenly.  He saw that she had been in some
\par concern, so led her over to the sofa in the window and sat down beside
\par her.
\par 
\par "Now, dear, tell me all about it!" he said.
\par 
\par She rushed breathlessly through all the details of her adventure on the
\par turret roof.  Adam listened attentively, helping her all he could, and
\par not embarrassing her by any questioning.  His thoughtful silence was a
\par great help to her, for it allowed her to collect and organise her
\par thoughts.
\par 
\par "I must go and see Caswall to-morrow, to hear what he has to say on the
\par subject."
\par 
\par "But, dear, for my sake, don't have any quarrel with Mr. Caswall.  I have
\par had too much trial and pain lately to wish it increased by any anxiety
\par regarding you."
\par 
\par "You shall not, dear--if I can help it--please God," he said solemnly,
\par and he kissed her.
\par 
\par Then, in order to keep her interested so that she might forget the fears
\par and anxieties that had disturbed her, he began to talk over the details
\par of her adventure, making shrewd comments which attracted and held her
\par attention.  Presently, _inter alia_, he said:
\par 
\par "That's a dangerous game Caswall is up to.  It seems to me that that
\par young man--though he doesn't appear to know it--is riding for a fall!"
\par 
\par "How, dear?  I don't understand."
\par 
\par "Kite flying on a night like this from a place like the tower of Castra
\par Regis is, to say the least of it, dangerous.  It is not merely courting
\par death or other accident from lightning, but it is bringing the lightning
\par into where he lives.  Every cloud that is blowing up here--and they all
\par make for the highest point--is bound to develop into a flash of
\par lightning.  That kite is up in the air and is bound to attract the
\par lightning.  Its cord makes a road for it on which to travel to earth.
\par When it does come, it will strike the top of the tower with a weight a
\par hundred times greater than a whole park of artillery, and will knock
\par Castra Regis into pieces.  Where it will go after that, no one can tell.
\par If there should be any metal by which it can travel, such will not only
\par point the road, but be the road itself."
\par 
\par "Would it be dangerous to be out in the open air when such a thing is
\par taking place?" she asked.
\par 
\par "No, little woman.  It would be the safest possible place--so long as one
\par was not in the line of the electric current."
\par 
\par "Then, do let us go outside.  I don't want to run into any foolish
\par danger--or, far more, to ask you to do so.  But surely if the open is
\par safest, that is the place for us."
\par 
\par Without another word, she put on again the cloak she had thrown off, and
\par a small, tight-fitting cap.  Adam too put on his cap, and, after seeing
\par that his revolver was all right, gave her his hand, and they left the
\par house together.
\par 
\par "I think the best thing we can do will be to go round all the places
\par which are mixed up in this affair."
\par 
\par "All right, dear, I am ready.  But, if you don't mind, we might go first
\par to Mercy.  I am anxious about grandfather, and we might see that--as yet,
\par at all events--nothing has happened there."
\par 
\par So they went on the high-hung road along the top of the Brow.  The wind
\par here was of great force, and made a strange booming noise as it swept
\par high overhead; though not the sound of cracking and tearing as it passed
\par through the woods of high slender trees which grew on either side of the
\par road.  Mimi could hardly keep her feet.  She was not afraid; but the
\par force to which she was opposed gave her a good excuse to hold on to her
\par husband extra tight.
\par 
\par At Mercy there was no one up--at least, all the lights were out.  But to
\par Mimi, accustomed to the nightly routine of the house, there were manifest
\par signs that all was well, except in the little room on the first floor,
\par where the blinds were down.  Mimi could not bear to look at that, to
\par think of it.  Adam understood her pain, for he had been keenly interested
\par in poor Lilla.  He bent over and kissed her, and then took her hand and
\par held it hard.  Thus they passed on together, returning to the high road
\par towards Castra Regis.
\par 
\par At the gate of Castra Regis they were extra careful.  When drawing near,
\par Adam stumbled upon the wire that Lady Arabella had left trailing on the
\par ground.
\par 
\par Adam drew his breath at this, and spoke in a low, earnest whisper:
\par 
\par "I don't want to frighten you, Mimi dear, but wherever that wire is there
\par is danger."
\par 
\par "Danger!  How?"
\par 
\par "That is the track where the lightning will go; at any moment, even now
\par whilst we are speaking and searching, a fearful force may be loosed upon
\par us.  Run on, dear; you know the way to where the avenue joins the
\par highroad.  If you see any sign of the wire, keep away from it, for God's
\par sake.  I shall join you at the gateway."
\par 
\par "Are you going to follow that wire alone?"
\par 
\par "Yes, dear.  One is sufficient for that work.  I shall not lose a moment
\par till I am with you."
\par 
\par "Adam, when I came with you into the open, my main wish was that we
\par should be together if anything serious happened.  You wouldn't deny me
\par that right, would you, dear?"
\par 
\par "No, dear, not that or any right.  Thank God that my wife has such a
\par wish.  Come; we will go together.  We are in the hands of God.  If He
\par wishes, we shall be together at the end, whenever or wherever that may
\par be."
\par 
\par They picked up the trail of the wire on the steps and followed it down
\par the avenue, taking care not to touch it with their feet.  It was easy
\par enough to follow, for the wire, if not bright, was self-coloured, and
\par showed clearly.  They followed it out of the gateway and into the avenue
\par of Diana's Grove.
\par 
\par Here a new gravity clouded Adam's face, though Mimi saw no cause for
\par fresh concern.  This was easily enough explained.  Adam knew of the
\par explosive works in progress regarding the well-hole, but the matter had
\par been kept from his wife.  As they stood near the house, Adam asked Mimi
\par to return to the road, ostensibly to watch the course of the wire,
\par telling her that there might be a branch wire leading somewhere else.  She
\par was to search the undergrowth, and if she found it, was to warn him by
\par the Australian native "Coo-ee!"
\par 
\par Whilst they were standing together, there came a blinding flash of
\par lightning, which lit up for several seconds the whole area of earth and
\par sky.  It was only the first note of the celestial prelude, for it was
\par followed in quick succession by numerous flashes, whilst the crash and
\par roll of thunder seemed continuous.
\par 
\par Adam, appalled, drew his wife to him and held her close.  As far as he
\par could estimate by the interval between lightning and thunder-clap, the
\par heart of the storm was still some distance off, so he felt no present
\par concern for their safety.  Still, it was apparent that the course of the
\par storm was moving swiftly in their direction.  The lightning flashes came
\par faster and faster and closer together; the thunder-roll was almost
\par continuous, not stopping for a moment--a new crash beginning before the
\par old one had ceased.  Adam kept looking up in the direction where the kite
\par strained and struggled at its detaining cord, but, of course, the dull
\par evening light prevented any distinct scrutiny.
\par 
\par At length there came a flash so appallingly bright that in its glare
\par Nature seemed to be standing still.  So long did it last, that there was
\par time to distinguish its configuration.  It seemed like a mighty tree
\par inverted, pendent from the sky.  The whole country around within the
\par angle of vision was lit up till it seemed to glow.  Then a broad ribbon
\par of fire seemed to drop on to the tower of Castra Regis just as the
\par thunder crashed.  By the glare, Adam could see the tower shake and
\par tremble, and finally fall to pieces like a house of cards.  The passing
\par of the lightning left the sky again dark, but a blue flame fell downward
\par from the tower, and, with inconceivable rapidity, running along the
\par ground in the direction of Diana's Grove, reached the dark silent house,
\par which in the instant burst into flame at a hundred different points.
\par 
\par At the same moment there rose from the house a rending, crashing sound of
\par woodwork, broken or thrown about, mixed with a quick scream so appalling
\par that Adam, stout of heart as he undoubtedly was, felt his blood turn into
\par ice.  Instinctively, despite the danger and their consciousness of it,
\par husband and wife took hands and listened, trembling.  Something was going
\par on close to them, mysterious, terrible, deadly!  The shrieks continued,
\par though less sharp in sound, as though muffled.  In the midst of them was
\par a terrific explosion, seemingly from deep in the earth.
\par 
\par The flames from Castra Regis and from Diana's Grove made all around
\par almost as light as day, and now that the lightning had ceased to flash,
\par their eyes, unblinded, were able to judge both perspective and detail.
\par The heat of the burning house caused the iron doors to warp and collapse.
\par Seemingly of their own accord, they fell open, and exposed the interior.
\par The Saltons could now look through to the room beyond, where the well-
\par hole yawned, a deep narrow circular chasm.  From this the agonised
\par shrieks were rising, growing ever more terrible with each second that
\par passed.
\par 
\par But it was not only the heart-rending sound that almost paralysed poor
\par Mimi with terror.  What she saw was sufficient to fill her with evil
\par dreams for the remainder of her life.  The whole place looked as if a sea
\par of blood had been beating against it.  Each of the explosions from below
\par had thrown out from the well-hole, as if it had been the mouth of a
\par cannon, a mass of fine sand mixed with blood, and a horrible repulsive
\par slime in which were great red masses of rent and torn flesh and fat.  As
\par the explosions kept on, more and more of this repulsive mass was shot up,
\par the great bulk of it falling back again.  Many of the awful fragments
\par were of something which had lately been alive.  They quivered and
\par trembled and writhed as though they were still in torment, a supposition
\par to which the unending scream gave a horrible credence.  At moments some
\par mountainous mass of flesh surged up through the narrow orifice, as though
\par forced by a measureless power through an opening infinitely smaller than
\par itself.  Some of these fragments were partially covered with white skin
\par as of a human being, and others--the largest and most numerous--with
\par scaled skin as of a gigantic lizard or serpent.  Once, in a sort of lull
\par or pause, the seething contents of the hole rose, after the manner of a
\par bubbling spring, and Adam saw part of the thin form of Lady Arabella,
\par forced up to the top amid a mass of blood and slime, and what looked as
\par if it had been the entrails of a monster torn into shreds.  Several times
\par some masses of enormous bulk were forced up through the well-hole with
\par inconceivable violence, and, suddenly expanding as they came into larger
\par space, disclosed sections of the White Worm which Adam and Sir Nathaniel
\par had seen looking over the trees with its enormous eyes of emerald-green
\par flickering like great lamps in a gale.
\par 
\par At last the explosive power, which was not yet exhausted, evidently
\par reached the main store of dynamite which had been lowered into the worm
\par hole.  The result was appalling.  The ground for far around quivered and
\par opened in long deep chasms, whose edges shook and fell in, throwing up
\par clouds of sand which fell back and hissed amongst the rising water.  The
\par heavily built house shook to its foundations.  Great stones were thrown
\par up as from a volcano, some of them, great masses of hard stone, squared
\par and grooved with implements wrought by human hands, breaking up and
\par splitting in mid air as though riven by some infernal power.  Trees near
\par the house--and therefore presumably in some way above the hole, which
\par sent up clouds of dust and steam and fine sand mingled, and which carried
\par an appalling stench which sickened the spectators--were torn up by the
\par roots and hurled into the air.  By now, flames were bursting violently
\par from all over the ruins, so dangerously that Adam caught up his wife in
\par his arms, and ran with her from the proximity of the flames.
\par 
\par Then almost as quickly as it had begun, the whole cataclysm ceased,
\par though a deep-down rumbling continued intermittently for some time.  Then
\par silence brooded over all--silence so complete that it seemed in itself a
\par sentient thing--silence which seemed like incarnate darkness, and
\par conveyed the same idea to all who came within its radius.  To the young
\par people who had suffered the long horror of that awful night, it brought
\par relief--relief from the presence or the fear of all that was
\par horrible--relief which seemed perfected when the red rays of sunrise shot
\par up over the far eastern sea, bringing a promise of a new order of things
\par with the coming day.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par His bed saw little of Adam Salton for the remainder of that night.  He
\par and Mimi walked hand in hand in the brightening dawn round by the Brow to
\par Castra Regis and on to Lesser Hill.  They did so deliberately, in an
\par attempt to think as little as possible of the terrible experiences of the
\par night.  The morning was bright and cheerful, as a morning sometimes is
\par after a devastating storm.  The clouds, of which there were plenty in
\par evidence, brought no lingering idea of gloom.  All nature was bright and
\par joyous, being in striking contrast to the scenes of wreck and
\par devastation, the effects of obliterating fire and lasting ruin.
\par 
\par The only evidence of the once stately pile of Castra Regis and its
\par inhabitants was a shapeless huddle of shattered architecture, dimly seen
\par as the keen breeze swept aside the cloud of acrid smoke which marked the
\par site of the once lordly castle.  As for Diana's Grove, they looked in
\par vain for a sign which had a suggestion of permanence.  The oak trees of
\par the Grove were still to be seen--some of them--emerging from a haze of
\par smoke, the great trunks solid and erect as ever, but the larger branches
\par broken and twisted and rent, with bark stripped and chipped, and the
\par smaller branches broken and dishevelled looking from the constant stress
\par and threshing of the storm.
\par 
\par Of the house as such, there was, even at the short distance from which
\par they looked, no trace.  Adam resolutely turned his back on the
\par devastation and hurried on.  Mimi was not only upset and shocked in many
\par ways, but she was physically "dog tired," and falling asleep on her feet.
\par Adam took her to her room and made her undress and get into bed, taking
\par care that the room was well lighted both by sunshine and lamps.  The only
\par obstruction was from a silk curtain, drawn across the window to keep out
\par the glare.  He sat beside her, holding her hand, well knowing that the
\par comfort of his presence was the best restorative for her.  He stayed with
\par her till sleep had overmastered her wearied body.  Then he went softly
\par away.  He found his uncle and Sir Nathaniel in the study, having an early
\par cup of tea, amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast.  Adam
\par explained that he had not told his wife that he was going over the
\par horrible places again, lest it should frighten her, for the rest and
\par sleep in ignorance would help her and make a gap of peacefulness between
\par the horrors.
\par 
\par Sir Nathaniel agreed.
\par 
\par "We know, my boy," he said, "that the unfortunate Lady Arabella is dead,
\par and that the foul carcase of the Worm has been torn to pieces--pray God
\par that its evil soul will never more escape from the nethermost hell."
\par 
\par They visited Diana's Grove first, not only because it was nearer, but
\par also because it was the place where most description was required, and
\par Adam felt that he could tell his story best on the spot.  The absolute
\par destruction of the place and everything in it seen in the broad daylight
\par was almost inconceivable.  To Sir Nathaniel, it was as a story of horror
\par full and complete.  But to Adam it was, as it were, only on the fringes.
\par He knew what was still to be seen when his friends had got over the
\par knowledge of externals.  As yet, they had only seen the outside of the
\par house--or rather, where the outside of the house once had been.  The
\par great horror lay within.  However, age--and the experience of age--counts.
\par 
\par A strange, almost elemental, change in the aspect had taken place in the
\par time which had elapsed since the dawn.  It would almost seem as if Nature
\par herself had tried to obliterate the evil signs of what had occurred.
\par True, the utter ruin of the house was made even more manifest in the
\par searching daylight; but the more appalling destruction which lay beneath
\par was not visible.  The rent, torn, and dislocated stonework looked worse
\par than before; the upheaved foundations, the piled-up fragments of masonry,
\par the fissures in the torn earth--all were at the worst.  The Worm's hole
\par was still evident, a round fissure seemingly leading down into the very
\par bowels of the earth.  But all the horrid mass of blood and slime, of
\par torn, evil-smelling flesh and the sickening remnants of violent death,
\par were gone.  Either some of the later explosions had thrown up from the
\par deep quantities of water which, though foul and corrupt itself, had still
\par some cleansing power left, or else the writhing mass which stirred from
\par far below had helped to drag down and obliterate the items of horror.  A
\par grey dust, partly of fine sand, partly of the waste of the falling ruin,
\par covered everything, and, though ghastly itself, helped to mask something
\par still worse.
\par 
\par After a few minutes of watching, it became apparent to the three men that
\par the turmoil far below had not yet ceased.  At short irregular intervals
\par the hell-broth in the hole seemed as if boiling up.  It rose and fell
\par again and turned over, showing in fresh form much of the nauseous detail
\par which had been visible earlier.  The worst parts were the great masses of
\par the flesh of the monstrous Worm, in all its red and sickening aspect.
\par Such fragments had been bad enough before, but now they were infinitely
\par worse.  Corruption comes with startling rapidity to beings whose
\par destruction has been due wholly or in part to lightning--the whole mass
\par seemed to have become all at once corrupt!  The whole surface of the
\par fragments, once alive, was covered with insects, worms, and vermin of all
\par kinds.  The sight was horrible enough, but, with the awful smell added,
\par was simply unbearable.  The Worm's hole appeared to breathe forth death
\par in its most repulsive forms.  The friends, with one impulse, moved to the
\par top of the Brow, where a fresh breeze from the sea was blowing up.
\par 
\par At the top of the Brow, beneath them as they looked down, they saw a
\par shining mass of white, which looked strangely out of place amongst such
\par wreckage as they had been viewing.  It appeared so strange that Adam
\par suggested trying to find a way down, so that they might see it more
\par closely.
\par 
\par "We need not go down; I know what it is," Sir Nathaniel said.  "The
\par explosions of last night have blown off the outside of the cliffs--that
\par which we see is the vast bed of china clay through which the Worm
\par originally found its way down to its lair.  I can catch the glint of the
\par water of the deep quags far down below.  Well, her ladyship didn't
\par deserve such a funeral--or}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid4474799  such a monument."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid476987\charrsid1990595 
\par 
\par The horrors of the last few hours had played such havoc with Mimi's
\par nerves, that a change of scene was imperative--if a permanent breakdown
\par was to be avoided.
\par 
\par "I think," said old Mr. Salton, "it is quite time you young people
\par departed for that honeymoon of yours!"  There was a twinkle in his eye as
\par he spoke.
\par 
\par Mimi's soft shy glance at her stalwart husband, was sufficient answer.

\par individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
\par located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
\par copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
\par works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
\par are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
\par Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
\par freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
\par this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
\par the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
\par keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project

\par 
\par 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

\par 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
\par trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
\par providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
\par with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

\par or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
\par work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
\par Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

\par 
\par Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
\par electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
\par including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
\par because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
\par people in all walks of life.
\par 
\par Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
\par assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
\par goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
\par remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
\par Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
\par and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
\par To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
\par and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

\par Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
\par Literary Archive Foundation
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
\par spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
\par increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
\par freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
\par array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
\par ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
\par status with the IRS.
\par 
\par The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
\par charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
\par States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
\par considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
\par with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
\par where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
\par SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
\par particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate
\par 
\par While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
\par have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
\par against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
\par approach us with offers to donate.
\par 
\par International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
\par any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
\par outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
\par 
\par Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
\par methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
\par ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
\par donations.  To donate, please visit:

s own voice. The voice began demanding food, and anything shoved into the giant mouth soon disappeared. The mouth was never satisfied and demanded more and more food, while Natsaburo was slowly starving to death, deprived of sustenance.

\par At his wit\rquote s end on how to help his son, Shichizaemon sent for the famous doctor Kan Gensai. The renowned physician took one look at Chusaburo and declared that he was infected with an Oseichu. Dr.
 Gensai whipped up a special blend of six medicines, and fed them directly into the extra mouth protruding from Chusaburo\rquote 
s belly. After the first day, the mouth ceased to speak and the boil reduced in size. By the second day, Chusaburo expelled a giant worm from his anus\emdash 
33 centimeters long. The worm looked like a lizard, with an arrow shaped head and long body. It tried to run away, but everyone in the room immediately set upon it and beat it to death.

\par Both the Shin Chomonju and Shiojiri tell tales similar to The Oseichu of Chusaburo, with only slight variation. Shin Chomonju sets the 
story in Tokyo, while Shiojiri says the mysterious illness occurred in the Abura no Koji district of Kyoto. Shiojiri also says the medicine took 10 days instead of 2.
\par The Kanden Jihitsu tells a similar, but different story. In the 3rd year of Genbun (1738)
 , a side show manager running a Misemono (Seeing Things) show in Tamba province (modern day Kyoto) heard a rumor about a woman infected by an oseichu. He immediately went to her house to attempt to recruit her for the show, and was stunned to find an aut

6-year-old male was apparently asymptomatic until August 16, 2011, when, in the background of vague sensation of something crawling under his skin, he developed a sudden onset belief that he has been infested by worms that crawl under his skin as well as 
t
ravel throughout his body. Over next few days, he experienced these sensation again with which he reinforced his belief to an unshakeable level of delusion, although there were no physical feature suggestive of an infestation or any logical ground for hol
d
ing his belief with such conviction. He started pinching his skins to get hold of those worms. He believed these worms to be of 3-7 cm in length and numerous in numbers. He believed that these worms were biting him, damaging his internal organ, and eating
 
his bone and that they would finally kill him. He became fearful and sought help from a physician. He was prescribed tablet albendazole, which provided him no relief. He further consulted another physician. Routine hemogram and urinalysis was unremarkable
.
 He was given antihelminthic and antiallergens to no relief. He was counseled that he does not have an infestation and his complaints had no physical explanation; however, he held on to his belief regardless. He lost his appetite, remained anxious, and sl
e
pt less. He was noted by his treating physician to be dull and withdrawn, which led to the psychiatric referral. There was history of hepatitis A 2 months back, which had responded to management by physician and local faith healer. There was no history of
 
pruritis during and after the recovery from hepatitis. There was no past or family history of any neurological, psychiatric, endocrinal, chronic, or allergic illness. He consumed alcohol occasionally. There was no history of any other substance abuse. Phy
s
ical examination on admission did not reveal any feature of active hepatitis or thyromegaly. Systemic examination was within normal limit. Skin examination revealed itch marks and skin excoriations both the limbs and on other accessible parts of the body.
 
Mental status examination revealed anxious and depressed affect, delusion of parasitosis, tactile hallucination, impaired insight, and reduced biodrives in a clear sensorium. He was admitted in the psychiatry ward for inpatient management. Serial evaluati
o
n and ward observation revealed persistent delusion of parasitosis, delusional, and hallucinatory behavior of picking the skin in an attempt to catch the worm, intermittent wincing as he felt worms bit him, secondary depressive cognition, initial insomnia
,
 and reduced appetite. Relevant investigations including hemogram, urinanalysis, fecal analysis, thyroid function, liver function, VDRL, blood sugar, ultrasonography abdomen, viral marker for active hepatitis, electroencephalogram, and computed tomography
 
of the brain was within normal limit. He was also evaluated by dermatologist and physician for evaluation and exclusion of any organicity. He was subsequently diagnosed as a case of persistent delusional disorder (monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis
-
delusional parasitosis) as per International Classification of Disease (ICD-10-DCR) and managed with typical antipsychotic trifluperazine (10 mg/day), eclectic psychotherapy, and other supportive measures. His delusion and hallucination subsided over the 
next 2 weeks. He was discharged after 5 weeks on maintenance medication. He has subsequently been asymptomatic and euthymic. Presently, he is asymptomatic since last 7 months and been regular on monthly reviews.

often would present to nonpsychiatric medical professional. They might seek multiple consult to seek relief and would vehemently refuse psychiatric explanation of the symptoms. Poor response to nonpsychiatric treatment, healthcare cost, and significant di
stress may lead to secondary depressive features compounding the situation. Better awareness of such illness by general physician, early recognition, good rapport, timely referral, and empathic treatment are the cornerstones of management in such cases.

. Serotonin is involved in mood, appetite, sensory perception, and pain pathways. Norepinephrine is part of the fight-or-flight response and regulates blood pressure and calmness. Dopamine produces feelings of pleasure when released by the brain reward sy
stem.
\par One in ten Americans takes an antidepressant, including almost one in four women in their 40s and 50s. Women are twice as likely to develop depression as men.
\par Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase levels of serotonin. Fluoxetine (Pr
ozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), fluvoxamine (Luvox), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro) treat depression, anxiety disorders, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, eating disorders, and hot flashes. Potential side effects include ji
tteriness, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, sedation, headaches, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction.
\par Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) increase levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Venlafaxine (Effexor), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and desvenla
faxine (Pristiq) are used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, diabetic neuropathy, chronic pain, and fibromyalgia. Potential side effects include nausea, dry mouth, sweating, headache, decreased appetite, insomnia, increased blood pressure, and sexual
 dysfunction.
\par Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) also increase serotonin and norepinephrine. Amitriptyline (Elavil), clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor), doxepin (Sinequan), trimipramine (Surmontil), protriptyline (Vivac
til), and imipramine (Tofranil) are used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, and insomnia. Possible side effects include sedation, forgetfulness, dry mouth, dry skin, constipation, blurred vision, dif
ficulty urinating, dizziness, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, increased seizure risk, and cardiac complications.
\par Bupropion (Wellbutrin) increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. It treats depression, seasonal affective disorder, ADHD, and can be use
d for smoking cessation. It can also augment other antidepressants. Potential side effects include anxiety, dry mouth, insomnia, and tremor. It can lower the seizure threshold. There are minimal to no sexual side effects or weight gain.
\par Trazodone (Desyrel, Oleptro) affects serotonin and mirtazapine (Remeron) affects serotonin and norepinephrine. They are both used for depression and sleep. Mirtazapine has minimal sexual side effects.
\par Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) increase serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. }{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid226822\charrsid1990595

 are associated with more serious side effects than other antidepressants. There are dietary restrictions and numerous drug interactions. MAOIs are often used after other antidepressant classes have been tried. Other antidepress
ants need to be discontinued for a period of time prior to starting an MAOI.
\par Newer antidepressants include Viibryd (vilazodone) which affects serotonin, Fetzima (levomilnacipran) which affects serotonin and norepinephrine, and Brintellix (vortioxetine) whi
ch affects serotonin. Brintellix and Viibryd have mechanisms of action that make them unique from SSRIs. Viibryd is less likely to cause sexual side effects.
\par Excess serotonin can accumulate when antidepressants are used with other medications that effect s
erotonin (other antidepressants, triptans for migraines, certain muscle relaxers, certain pain medications, certain antinausea medications, dextromethorphan, St. John\rquote 
s Wort, tryptophan, stimulants, LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, etc.) Symptoms of serotonin syndro
me include anxiety, agitation, restlessness, easy startling, delirium, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased temperature, profuse sweating, shivering, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, and muscle rigidity or twitching. Life threatening sympt
oms include high fever, seizures, irregular heartbeat, and unconsciousness.
\par Varying estrogen levels during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopause, and menopause raise issues with antidepressants and depression that are unique to women. Es
trogen increases serotonin, so a decrease in estrogen at certain times in a woman\rquote 
s reproductive life cycle can reduce serotonin levels and lead to symptoms of depression. Hormonal contraception and hormone replacement therapy can reduce or increase depres
sive symptoms; an increase in symptoms may be more likely in women who already had major depressive disorder. During pregnancy, antidepressants have a potential risk to the developing baby but there are also risks of untreated depression on the baby
\rquote s development. With breastfeeding, some antidepressants pass minimally into breast milk and may not affect the baby. The benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks of taking these medications.\~\~
 Antidepressant sexual side effects in women are vaginal dryne
ss, decreased genital sensations, decreased libido, and difficulty achieving orgasm. Women should communicate with their psychiatrist and/or OB/GYN to discuss the risks and benefits of medication use vs. untreated illness during pregnancy and breastfeedin
g; the use of hormonal treatments to regulate symptoms associated with menses and menopause; and the treatment of sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants.

 especially is high among women, up 29 percent since 2001, the report showed, and anti-anxiety meds are used by women at almost twice the rate seen among men. In 2010, 11 percent of middle-aged women were on an anti-anxiety medication, while only 5.7 perc
ent of men that age were. There\rquote s also a gender shift when it comes to the use of drugs for ADHD in adulthood: although the disorder is thought to afflict primarily young boys, slightly more women use ADHD medications as adults than men.
\par The use of atypical antipsychotics \emdash  medications once mainly prescribed for schizophrenia \emdash 
 have gone up dramatically as well. The number of adults ages 20 to 64 taking these meds is 3.5 times higher than it was 2001. And although the number of men on these drugs increased m
ore dramatically during that time, there are still more women than men taking the medications.
\par Dr. David Muzina, a psychiatrist and national practice leader of the Medco Neuroscience Therapeutic Resource Center, took The Huffington Post through the study\rquote s results and what they mean. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 One in four women is on antidepressants, and women are using \emdash  or at least prescribed \emdash  these medications at higher rates than men. Any idea why that\rquote 
s happening? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
\par In general, we know that women tend to seek treatment and go to doctors\rquote 
 offices more frequently than men do. When you move into the behavioral health space, that may be even more true, so the opportunity to get evaluated and diagnosed and treated is likely higher. That may, to some extent, explain some of the differences.

\par We also believe that [women] may be at higher risk for major depressive disorders. It likely is biological. We don\rquote 
t know exactly why. I can speak from experience as a practicing psychiatrist, comparing a general visit between a psychiatrist and a w
oman versus a male patient, that there is more resistance and reluctance from the men to be willing to accept treatment. There may be some subtle differences there with men thinking they need to tough it out.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 Women are using anti\u8208\'2danxiety medication at more than twice the rate of men. Why is that?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
\par [Anti-anxiety medications] are fast-acting. They\rquote re in that Valium family, and they\rquote re very commonly used to treat adjustment disorders \emdash  these brief periods of time for a month or two when someone has life stresso
rs and is having difficulty coping. An example would be a marital discord, going through a separation or a divorce. A job would be a big one, particularly in the current economy. 
\par Women are bearing the brunt of the emotional stressors around us: they\rquote re working, raising the kids, trying to juggle all these issues, getting all these things done, and they\rquote re more likely to reach out and ask for help.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 Is there any relationship between the increase in female antidepressant use and the increase in anti-anxiety use?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 

\par I think that this [gender] difference likely mirrors what we\rquote 
re seeing with the depression medications to some extent. Anxiety disorders are completely different than mood disorders but [there is an] overwhelming frequency with which you see them on top of existing depression. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 Typically we think of boys being more affected by ADHD, but there\rquote s gender shift in the use of ADHD medications in adulthood. What\rquote s going on there?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
\par We\rquote ve seen an increased recognition [in psychiatry] that the condition is presen
t in adults. An anecdotal interpretation on my behalf is, think about who takes kids to their doctors appointments and who is making sure their medications go to the school? It\rquote 
s almost always the moms. My thinking around this that the women are more in touch with what\rquote s going on with their kids, so they\rquote re perhaps recognizing, \lquote Wait, I have these symptoms as well,\rquote  or \lquote I did when I was a kid.
\rquote  They\rquote re more likely to have a conversation with their kids\rquote  doctors. 
\par Additionally, the hyperactive form of this disorder is more easily recognized in boys and girls tend to have the inattentive form. In the classroom, quietly inattentive doesn\rquote 
t cause problems like the hyperactive interruptive boy might. So it may be easier for [girls] to slip through the cracks in school, and then [the disorder] may become clearer in adult life. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 How about the data on women\rquote s use of atypical antipsychotics? Why have these numbers grown so much? }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
\par Initially, atypical antipsychotics came on the market as treatment for schizophrenia. Sub
sequent studies have demonstrated their efficacy in treating bipolar disorder, primary the manic part of the illness. More recently, a couple of these antipsychotics have also been studied in terms of treating major depressive disorder, as an add-on to ot
her depression medications. So they\rquote ve been expanding the indications for these medications. Since we\rquote 
ve found that several of these medications, when added to depression medications, can make the treatment more likely to be effective, and since women are more likely to be on antidepressants, you can connect the dots. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 What do you think these numbers indicate about our overall relationship with psychiatric medications in this country?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 

\par We see this increase in medication use, and it\rquote s a trend over time. Something\rquote s going on there. We recognize that, particularly in America, we tend to like our fast-fixes. If there\rquote 
s a pill for something, that might be the easier, faster approach than talking it through or exercising. And then there have been studies that have shown that over the last decade, there\rquote s been a decrease in the utilization of psychotherapy 
\emdash  also known as counseling and talk therapy \emdash  for mental health disorders. 
\par When you match those lines \emdash  an increase in drug use and a decrease in psychotherapy use \emdash  we\rquote re tending to look to medications a bit more than before. So it\rquote 
s important in looking at this data that we step back and think very carefully about making these diagnoses, prescribing these medications and then monitoring them for safety and effecti
veness, because there are other non-medication approaches that are helpful.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 What should doctors and patients take away from this report?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
\par All drugs they come with risk. When I see numbers like this, with an increased trend, it emphasizes the importance that
 both patients and their doctors are aware of the risks of these medications. For example, with antidepressant medications in young adults, there is a risk early on of an increase in suicidal thoughts and perhaps suicidal behavior that clearly needs to be
 monitored very closely. The other example would be with the atypical antipsychotics, which have been associated with an increase in cholesterol. There\rquote 
s an association with Type 2 diabetes, and it can be a very rapid onset. Thinking about the overall health risks is crucial. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \cs19\b\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 Is there any evidence that these medications are helping women?}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
\par I don\rquote t know that it\rquote s definitely making them happier or more functional. What I would say is that these are effective treatments when someone is correctly diagnosed, rece
ives the right medication, at the right dose, for the right duration of time. They can make a dramatic difference. In those cases, absolutely yes, they\rquote re helping women.

ess that is the most common mood disorder in the United States. It has been almost 50 years since the monoamine hypothesis of depression was articulated, and just over 50 years since the first pharmacological treatment for MDD was discovered. Several mono
amine-based pharmacological drug classes have been developed and approved for the treatment of MDD; however, remission rates are low (often less than 60%) and there is a delayed onset before remission of depressive symptoms is achieved. As a result of a 
\'93proof-of-concept\'94
 study in 2000 with the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine, a number of studies have examined the glutamatergic systems as viable targets for the treatment of MDD. This review will provide a brief history on the development of clinicall
y available antidepressant drugs, and then review the possible role of glutamatergic systems in the pathophysiology of MDD. Specifically, the glutamatergic review will focus on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the efficacy of drugs that target
 
the NMDA receptor for the treatment of MDD. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which has consistently produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in MDD patients in a number of clinical studies, has shown the most promise as a n
o
vel glutamatergic-based treatment for MDD. However, compounds that target other glutamatergic mechanisms, such as GLYX-13 (a glycine-site partial agonist at NMDA receptors) appear promising in early clinical trials. Thus, the clinical findings to date are
 encouraging and support the continued search for and the development of novel compounds that target glutamatergic mechanisms.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid226822\charrsid1990595

eloping ligands that would selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at serotonin transporters, and as a result would increase serotonin concentrations within the synaptic cleft to further stimulate postsynaptic serotonin receptors. In 1974, the first
 
report on the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) LY110140 (fluoxetine) was published and in that publication the authors suggested that fluoxetine would be an antidepressant drug (Wong, Horng, Bymaster, Hauser, & Molloy, 1974). The following ye

r Wong and colleagues demonstrated that fluoxetine, an analogue of the phenoxyphenylpropylamine nisoxetine (LY94939), was a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with relatively weak affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (Wong, Bymaster,
 Horng, & Molloy, 1975), which separated fluoxetine pharmacologically from other antidepressant drugs. Fluoxetine was approved by the FDA in December of 1987 and was launched to the market in January 1988 under the trade name Prozac\'ae
 (for anexcellence review on the development of fluoxetine see Wong, Bymaster, & Engleman, 1995; Wong, Perry, & Bymaster, 2005). Since the introduction of fluoxetine to the market, several other SSRIs have been approved by the FDA (e.g. sertraline [Zoloft
\'ae], citalopram [Celexa\'ae], paroxetine [Paxil\'ae], and escitalopram [Lexapro\'ae
]).Although fluoxetine was the first SSRI approved and marketed in the United States, the clinical trials (Phase I-Phase III) lasted more than seven years and during that time Astra AB introduced the first SSRI zimeldine (Zelmid\'ae
) to the European market in March 1982. Zimeldine, which was derived from pheniramine, was removed from the European market in September 1983 due to severe side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions and Guillain-Barre syndrome, wh
ich is acute peripheral neuropathy. The hypersensitivity reactions resembled a flu- like syndrome which included fever, joint/muscle pain, headaches and hepatic effects. The estimated occurrence of the hypersensitivity reaction was 3:1000. Interestingly, 
z
imeldine produced the hypersensitivity reactions in 1.5% of patients during clinical trials, but was still approved in the European market (Montgomery, Gabriel, James, Hawley, & Burkitt, 1989; Nilsson, 1983). During the 16 months that zimelidine was on th
e
 market there were 10 confirmed cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and all of these patients were under zimeldine treatment (Fagius, Osterman, Siden, & Wiholm, 1985).SSRIs are 20-1500 fold more selective for inhibiting serotonin over norepinephrine at their
 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af352\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f352\fs24\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 respective transporter proteins and have minimal binding affinity for other postsynaptic receptors such as adrenergic \'e11,\'e12, and \'e2
, histamine H1, muscarinic, and dopamine D2 receptors (Owens et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 1987). SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine and ci}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid1990595\charrsid1990595 
talopram) also do not stimulate the release of serotonin or norepinephrine presynaptically (Rothman et al., 2001) and have weak or no direct pharmacological action at postsynaptic serotonin receptors (e.g. 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2c) (Owens et al., 1997; 
S\'e1
nchez & Hyttel, 1999; Thomas et al., 1987). Therefore, the increase in activity at the postsynaptic serotonin receptors produced by SSRIs is a result of increased concentrations of serotonin in the synaptic cleft via reuptake inhibition rather than direct
 binding at the postsynaptic receptor. The most common side effects associated with SSRIs are nausea, insomnia, and sexuual dysfunction
