# Diamonds ELO

## TODO

**Now**
- [ ] Run on web server at http://emdm.io/diamonds (linked to http://atlab.cct.lsu.edu:8081)
- [ ] Create interface for poet to be able to choose different pairings
- [ ] Create new portal for audience to find performance currently running
- [ ] Update the /data/seeds/xxxx/seed.html files to whatever they need to be to load in the browser properly.
  - The main index page allows users to set a sessionName this is stored on the server as well as in localStorage.  On any subsequent page on this domain you can get this sessionName via:  localStorage.getItem('sessionName')  

**Soon**
- [x] Reformat parsing of corpus into â‰ˆ500 line segments
- [ ] Add random selection of corpus segments if not enough return.
- [ ] Fix up corpii corpus files.  lilghettoqueer-corpus is functional, but the others cause failure.  probs bad syntax

**Later**
- [ ] Allow poet to load in their own poem and corpus

**Maybe**
- [ ] Replace markov with machine learning
