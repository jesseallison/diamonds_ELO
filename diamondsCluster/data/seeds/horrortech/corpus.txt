PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT
 Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a
hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and
its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes.
We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over
traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business
buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we
approach downtown section, the character of the city begins
to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We
see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-
vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.
vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of
nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.
 We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific
location. A skinny, high old hotel comes o view. On its
exposed brick side great big letters advertise "Transients-
Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough
to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open,
curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so
characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward
with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is
raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to
three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants
of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are
close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame
is in shot. No sounds come from within the room.
 Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between
shade and sill, peep o the room.
 A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears
a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude
of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of
the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome
conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl
nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.
 A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure
visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then
start forward. As we pass under the window shade,
A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow
bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the
bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-
top handbag are on the bureau.
 On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There
is no radio.
 The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt
and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man
with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting
his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at
Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps
her face turned away from him.
 After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans
over and takes Mary o his arms, kisses her long and warmly,
holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed
and finally errupted by the buzzing closeness of an
inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow
Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns
at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, imate,
playful voice.
 SAM
Never did eat your lunch, did you.
 Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her,
kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings
her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds
her shoes, slips her feet o searches them. And finally
pulls away and sits up.
 MARY
I better get back to the office.
These ended lunch hours give my
boss excess acid.
 She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings
out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or
perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam
watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery,
humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they
occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.
 SAM
Call your boss and tell him you're
taking the rest of the afternoon
off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
 MARY
(soft sarcasm)
What do I do with my free afternoon,
walk you to the airport?
 SAM
(meaningfully)
We could laze around here a while
longer.
 MARY
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels
of this sort aren't erested in
you when you come in, but when your
time's up...
(a small anguish)
Sam, I hate having to be with you in
a place like this.
 SAM
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend occasional nights
in cheap hotels. They say it...
 MARY
(errupting)
When you're married you can do a lot
of things deliberately.
 SAM
You sure talk like a girl who's been
married.
 MARY
Sam!
 SAM
I'm sorry, Mary.
(after a moment)
My old Dad used to say 'when you
can't change a situation, laugh at
it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like
laughing at it.
 MARY
I've lost my girlish laughter.
 SAM
(observing)
The only girlish thing you have lost.
 MARY
(a meaningful quiet,
then, with difficulty:)
Sam. This is the last time.
 SAM
For what?
 MARY
This! Meeting you in secret so we
can be... secretive! You come down
here on business trips and we steal
lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't
even come.
 SAM
Okay. What do we do instead, write
each other lurid love letters?
 MARY
(about to argue, then
turning away)
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working
girl.
 SAM
And I'm a working man! We're a regular
working-class tragedy!
(he laughs)
 MARY
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we
go on meeting in shabby hotels
whenever you can find a tax-deductible
excuse for flying down deductible
here...
 SAM
(errupting,
seriously)
You can't laugh at it, huh?
 MARY
Can you?
 SAM
Sure. It's like laughing through a
broken jaw, but...
 He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window,
tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.
 It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares o the room,
revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if
corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the
fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor
again.
 SAM
And besides, when you say I make tax-
deductible excuses you make me out a
criminal.
 MARY
(having to smile)
You couldn't be a criminal if you
committed a major crime.
 SAM
I wish I were. Not an active criminal
but... a nice guy with the conscience
of a criminal.
(goes close to mary,
touches her)
N best thing to no conscience at
all.
 MARY
(pulling away)
I have to go, Sam.
 SAM
I can come down n week.
 MARY
No.
 SAM
Not even just to see you, to have
lunch... in public?
 MARY
We can see each other, we can even
have dinner... but respectably, in
my house with my mother's picture on
the mantel and my sister helping me
broil a big steak for three!
 SAM
And after the steak... do we send
Sister to the movies and turn Mama's
picture to the wall?
 MARY
Sam! No!
 SAM
(after a pause, simply)
All right.
 She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue
the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised
when they discover men will continue to want them even after
the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly,
places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and
simple sincerity.
 SAM
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-
deductible or not, I want to see
deductible you. And under any
conditions.
(a smile)
Even respectability.
 MARY
You make respectability sound...
disrespectful.
 SAM
(brightly)
I'm all for it! It requires patience
and temperance and a lot of sweating-
out... otherwise, though, it's only
hard work.
(a pause)
But if I can see you, touch you even
as simply as this... I won't mind.
 He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems
crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.
 SAM
I'm fed up with sweating for people
who aren't there. I sweat to pay off
my father's debts... and he's in his
grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife
alimony, and she's living on the
other side of the world somewhere.
 MARY
(a smile)
I pay, too. They also pay who meet
in hotel rooms.
 SAM
A couple of years and the debts will
be paid off. And if she ever re-
marries, the alimony stops... and
then...
 MARY
I haven't even been married once
yet!
 SAM
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
 MARY
(smiling, then with a
terrible urgency)
Sam, let's go get married.
 SAM
And live with me in a storeroom behind
a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll
have a lot of laughs. When I send my
ex-wife her money, you can lick the
stamps.
 MARY
(a deep desperation)
I'll lick the stamps.
 He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly,
looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.
 SAM
You know what I'd like? A clear,
empty sky... and a plane, and us in
it... and somewhere a private island
for sale, where we can run around
without our... shoes on. And the
wherewithal to buy what I'd like.
(he moves away,
suddenly serious)
Mary, you want to cut this off, go
out and find yourself someone
available.
 MARY
I'm thinking of it.
 SAM
(a cheerful shout)
How can you even think a thing like
that!
 MARY
(picking up handbag,
starting for door)
Don't miss your plane.
 SAM
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
 MARY
(at door)
I'm late... and you have to put your
shoes on.
 Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares
down at his shoeless feet,

  DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE
 Shooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly
to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)
 A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A
cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay
driver, cross pavement to the office door.
  OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
 Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her
temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last
of her teens.
 MARY
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
 CAROLINE
(a high, bright, eager-
to-talk voice laced
to-with a vague Texan
accent)
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property,
you know, that oil lease man... so
that's why he's late.
(a pause, then, as
Mary does not respond
to the poed thrust)
You getting a headache?
 MARY
It'll pass. Headaches are like
resolutions... you forget them soon
as they stop hurting.
 CAROLINE
You got aspirins? I have something...
not aspirins, but
(cheerfully takes
bottle of pills out
of desk drawer)
my mother's doctor gave these to me
the day of my wedding.
(laughs)
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers!
 She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.
 MARY
Were there any calls?
 CAROLINE
Teddy called. Me... And my mother
called to see if Teddy called. Oh,
and your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying
and she'll be gone the whole weekend
and...
 She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening.
MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the
office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a
trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-
hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful
vulgarity.
 CASSIDY
Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls
should get your boss to air-condition
you up. He can afford it today.
 Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead
Cassidy toward the private office.
 LOWERY
Mary, will you get those copies of
the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.
 Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the
desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.
 CASSIDY
Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little
girl...
(laughs as Mary looks
up at him)
Not you, my daughter! A baby, and
tomorrow she stands up there and
gets her sweet self married away
from me!
(pulling out wallet)
I want you to look at my baby.
Eighteen years old... and she's never
had an unhappy day in any one of
those years!
(flashes photo)
 Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some
remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore
the man's hot-breath closeness.
 LOWERY
Come on, Tom, my office is air-
conditioned.
 CASSIDY
(ignoring Lowery)
You know what I do with unhappiness?
I buy it off! You unhappy?
 MARY
Not inordinately.
(puts deed copy o
Cassidy's too-close
hand)
 CASSIDY
I'm buying this house for my baby's
wedding present. Forty thousand
dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying
happiness, that's buying off
unhappiness! That penniless punk
she's marryin'...
(laughs)
Probably a good kid... it's just
that I hate him.
(looks at deed)
Yup! Forty thousand, says here...
(to Lowery)
Casharoonie!
 He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of
new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's
nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious
green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk.
Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the
bills, laughs wickedly.
 CASSIDY
I never carry more than I can afford
to lose!
(closer to Mary)
Count 'em!
 LOWERY
(shocked, worried)
Tom... cash transactions of this
size! Most irregular...
 CASSIDY
So what? It's my private money!
(laughs, winks, elbows
Lowery)
And now it's yours.
 CAROLINE
(staring at the money)
I declare!
 CASSIDY
(whispering)
I don't! That's how I'm able to keep
it!
(laughs)
 LOWERY
(hastily errupting)
Suppose we just put this in the safe
and then Monday morning when you're
feeling good...
 CASSIDY
Speakin' of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said you had in your
desk...
(laughs, as if having
given away Lowery's
secret)
Oops!
(to Mary, patting her
arm)
Usually I can keep my mouth shut!
 He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks
to Mary, meaningfully.
 CASSIDY
Honest. I can keep any private
transaction a secret... any pri....
(stopped by Mary's
cold gaze)
Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!
 Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has
gone o Lower's office.
 LOWERY
(quietly)
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend. Put it in the safe
deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And
we'll get him to give us a check on
Monday - instead.
 He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going
to come and pull him bodily o the office. When the men
are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle,
smiles at it.
 CAROLINE
He was flirting with you. I guess he
noticed my wedding ring.
 Mary has put one bundle o a large envelope and takes the
other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the
filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed
copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office
door, knocks, starts to open door as:
 LOWERY (O.S.)
Come in.
  LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)
 Mary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large
tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary
remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk,
talking as she goes.
 MARY
The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't
mind, I'd like to go right on home
after the bank. I have a slight...
 CASSIDY
You go right home! Me and your boss
are going out to get ourselves a
little drinkin' done!
(to Lowery)
Right?
 LOWERY
(to Mary)
Of course. You feeling ill?
 MARY
A headache.
 CASSIDY
You need a week-end in Las Vegas...
playground of the world!
 MARY
I'm going to spend this week-end in
bed.
(starts out)
 CASSIDY
(to Lowery)
Only playground that beats Las Vegas!
 Mary goes back out o the outer office, closes door.
  OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
 Mary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make
sure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down o it.
During this:
 CAROLINE
Aren't you going to take the pills?
(as Mary shakes her
head)
They'll knock that headache out.
 MARY
I don't need pills... just sleep.
 She goes to the door.
 DISSOLVE:
  MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)
 A double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as
the CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only
in her slip. Perhaps she is about to get o bed. Behind
her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any
contents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to
show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side
of the bed.
 Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on
as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed
suitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then
brings some final garments from the closet.
 She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top.
Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an
impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.
 The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then
takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled
envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she
looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small
file-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those
brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and
policies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly,
puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her
bank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the
file-envelope and the bank book, o her handbag, takes one
quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and
the suitcase and goes out of the room.

  MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)
 A two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in
the driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily
read the Arizona number plate in the foreground.
 Mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, ending to
put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase
and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car,
begins to back out of driveway.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
 We are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled,
guilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care
of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic
irregularity. She stops for a red light at a main
ersection.
 FROM MARY'S VIEWPO - (DAY)
 We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right
in front of Mary's car.
 MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
 Mary freezes.
  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
 Cassidy, glancing o car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery
exclamation, elbows Lowery. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles
pleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.
 MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
 Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror
on her face.
  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
 Now we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a
small confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary
ended to "spend the weekend in bed." He considers,
curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his
face.
 MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
 Mary sees the pause and the look.
  MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
 For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to
cross back to the car.
 MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
 Mary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the
shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.
 Mary zooms the car away.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  HIGHWAY - (DAY)
 Mary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is
less tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she
checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas
station.
 FAST DISSOLVE TO:
 MARY'S CAR - (DAY)
 Approaching and leaving city limits.
 MARY - (DAY)
 Looks at gas gauge.
 C.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)
  A GAS STATION - (DAY)
 We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no
other cars about, this being a gas station off the main
highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary
looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face
turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
 No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as
if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that
she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty.
She has to blow her horn.
 A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.
 At that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the
shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's
car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's
insistent ringing unnerves Mary.
 She starts her car, zooms off.
 We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack.
He looks after the departing car with little or no expression.
 CAR
 The car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is
setting. There is something vaguely ominous about the
darkening sky o which the car seems to be disappearing.
 DISSOLVE TO:
 MARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)
 The oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting
sleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close,
involuntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as
if forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to
glare to a po beyond endurance. She murmurs "Sam - Sam."
 LONG LAP DISSOLVE:
  ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
 We see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft
shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like
a child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear
that the car is empty.
 After a moment, during which there are no other vehicles
passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY
PATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its
apparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car.
He gets out and approaches the driver's side window.
  MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
 The Patrolman looks down o the car.
  CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPO
 Mary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved
by the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex,
turns the ignition and presses down on the starter.
  CAR (DAWN)
 The Patrolman holds up his hand.
 PATROLMAN
(startled)
Hold it there!
 Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together.
The Patrolman raps again, less gently.
 Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies
her for a moment.
 PATROLMAN
In quite a hurry.
 MARY
Yes.
(because he seems to
be awaiting an
explanation)
I didn't mean to sleep so long. I
was afraid I'd have an accident last
night, from sleepiness... so I decided
to pull over...
 PATROLMAN
You slept here all night?
 MARY
(a fa edge of
defensiveness)
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my
eyes...
 PATROLMAN
(mere concern)
There are plenty of motels in this
area. You should have... I mean,
just to be safe...
 MARY
I didn't end to sleep all night!
I just pulled over... have I broken
any laws?
 PATROLMAN
No, m'am.
 MARY
Then I'm free to go...?
 PATROLMAN
(a pause)
Is anything wrong?
 MARY
Of course not! Am I acting as if...
something's wrong?
 PATROLMAN
(almost a smile)
Frankly, yes.
 MARY
Please... I'd like to go...
 PATROLMAN
Is there?
 MARY
Is there what?
(not waiting for an
answer)
I've told you there's nothing wrong...
except that I'm in a hurry and you're
taking up my time...
 PATROLMAN
(errupting, sternly)
Now wait just a moment! Turn your
motor off, please.
 Mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off
the ignition.
 PATROLMAN
In the course of my duty, I never
"take up" anyone's time, whether
it's to give a warning, or a ticket,
or help! Believe that, M'am.
(a little softer)
Now if you woke up on the wrong side
of... the car seat, that's one thing.
But when you act as if I've just
placed you under arrest...
 MARY
I'm sorry.
 PATROLMAN
No need to apologize...
 Mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the
matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone.
The Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who
demands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit
too abrupt. He calls:
 PATROLMAN
Wait a minute!
 MARY
(jamming down the
brake)
Now what?
 The Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:
 PATROLMAN
May I see your license?
 MARY
Why?
 PATROLMAN
Please.
 Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed
it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in
it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.
 The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously,
pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to
remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling
her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then
the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other
items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet,
opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at
the car.
  ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
 The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks
the license plate, and returns.
  MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
 The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the
steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet.
 She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment.
 He says nothing. She starts ahead, fast.
  ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
 The Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts
back to his automobile.
 MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
 She is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great
deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger.
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability
to act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives,
she glances o her rear-view mirror.
 MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)
 The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind
her at a matched speed.
 MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
 She glances out at her surroundings.
 MARY'S POV - (DAWN)
 The Freeway ahead.
  MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
 She suddenly turns off the highway.
 MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
 She checks her mirror.
 MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)
 The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off
after her.
 MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
 She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick
decision.
 DISSOLVE:
  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
 The big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise."
We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out
of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention
to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on
all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:
 CAR DEALER
With you in a second!
 Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making
a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand
on the corner, just outside the lot.
 She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is
fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy
herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot,
picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back o the car
lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes,
we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same
PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite
side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in
the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see
the Patrolman.
 The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting
for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.
 CAR DEALER
I'm in no mood for trouble!
 MARY
(glancing up, thrown
for a moment)
What?
 CAR DEALER
(cheerfully)
There's an old saying, "First customer
of the day is always the most
trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no
mood for it so I'm just going to
treat you so fair and square you
won't have one human reason to give
me...
 MARY
(errupting)
Can I trade in my car and take
another?
 CAR DEALER
You can do anything you've a mind
to... and bein' a woman, you will!
(chin-indicating her
car)
That yours?
 MARY
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it,
I'm just...
 CAR DEALER
Sick of the sight of it!
(laughs)
Well, suppose you look around for
something that strikes your eyes and
meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give
yours the once over and... want some
coffee? I was just about...
 MARY
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I
just want to make a change and
start...
 She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the
Patrolman.
 THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
 He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.
  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
 Mary has to force herself to look away.
 CAR DEALER
One thing people never ought to be
when they're buying a used car is in
a hurry!
(starting away toward
her car)
But like I said, too nice a day for
arguing. I'll just shoot this o
the garage.
 He starts o Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic,
wanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the
presence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing
cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be
followed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay
here.
 All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.
The Car Dealer has driven her car o the garage. She stands
in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target.
She looks toward the garage.
 THE GARAGE - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
 Mary's car is in it.
  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
 Mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further
suspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman.
 THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
 He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she
goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning.
 CAR DEALER
That's the one I'd've picked for you
myself!
 MARY
How much?
 CAR DEALER
Go ahead! Spin it around the block.
Now I know you don't know anything
about engine condition, but you can
feel, can't you... and it's all in
the feel, believe me, you feel that
one around the block...
 MARY
It looks fine. How much will it be,
with my car...?
 CAR DEALER
You mean you don't want the usual
day and a half to think it over?
(laughs)
You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin'
you?
 MARY
Of course not. Please.
 CAR DEALER
Well... heck, this is the first time
I ever saw the customer high-pressure
the salesman!
(laughs, sees she is
in no mood for it)
I'd figure roughly...
(looks at the car,
then back at the
garage)
...your car plus five hundred.
 MARY
Five hundred.
 CAR DEALER
Aha! Always got time to argue money,
huh...?
 MARY
All right.
 As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches
o her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses.
 CAR DEALER
(slowly)
I take it... you can prove that car's
yours... I mean, out of state and
all... got your pink slip and your...
 MARY
I think I have the necessary papers.
Is there a Ladies Room...
 CAR DEALER
In the building ...
(indicates, continues
to stare quietly)
Mary starts for the building, glancing
once in the direction of the
Patrolman.
 THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
 He still sits, his motor throbbing, his face quiet.
  THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
 Mary goes o the office building.

  LADIES ROOM - (DAY)
 Mary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag,
racts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off
five, puts the bundle back o the envelope and the envelope
back o the bag. Then she remembers, takes out the important
papers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having
to do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the
envelope, starts out of the ladies Room.

  THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
 The Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the
line. It stands in the clearing.
 CAR DEALER
(too cheerfully)
I think you'd better give it a trial
spin. Don't want any bad word of
mouth about California Charlie.
 MARY
I'd really rather not. Please. Can't
we just settle this and...
 CAR DEALER
I'll be perfectly honest with you,
Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust
you, but...
 MARY
(errupting)
But what? Is there anything so
terribly wrong about... making a
decision and wanting to hurry? Do
you think I've stolen... my car?
 CAR DEALER
No, M'am. I was only about to say,
I've sent my mechanic out to give
your car a little test... that's
all.
 MARY
(handing him the
ownership papers and
the new bills)
I'd like to be ready when he gets
back.
 CAR DEALER
Okay. If you'll come along...
 He starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely,
anxiously. She glances, sees:
 THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
 He is still at the far curb.
  USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
 The Car Dealer goes o his office. Mary follows.
 THE PATROLMAN - (DAY)
 A second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic,
comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He
pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the
office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's
car is driven back onto the lot.
 The MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the
Patrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he
is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office.
In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car,
gets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells:
 MECHANIC
Hey! Miss?
 Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic.
Her face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her.
Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase.
 MARY
(as Mechanic reaches
car)
Just put it right in here, please...
beside me.
 The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off.
As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer
and the Patrolman all looking after her.
 DISSOLVE TO:
 MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
 Mary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is
more shocked than pleased when she sees...
 MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
 No sign of the Patrolman.
 MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
 She turns her face, looks out at the highway.
 ROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV
 It is heavy with traffic.
 MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
 Again she checks the mirror and although...
 MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
 There is still no sign of the Patrolman.
 MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
 She cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that
nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions.
 CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety,
her fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a
person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this
realistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the
Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it
in her imagination. The "imagined voice" we hear is actually
the voice of the Car Dealer:
 CAR DEALER'S VOICE
Heck, Officer, that was the first
time I ever saw the Customer high-
pressure the Salesman! Somebody
chasing her?
 PATROLMAN'S VOICE
I better have a look at those papers,
Charlie.
 CAR DEALER'S VOICE
She look like a wrong-one to you?
 PATROLMAN'S VOICE
Acted like one.
 Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away
these voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view
mirror.
 MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
 Still no sight of the Patrolman.
 MARY IN NEW CAR
 She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when
she is sprung to tension again by....
  HIGHWAY
 The sight of a police car. As she drives past, we hear the
squeaky, unelligible voice coming over the car radio.
Mary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead.
 DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
  HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT
 Mary's car dashing along.
 DISSOLVE TO:
 MARY IN NEW CAR
 Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving.
Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.
 OUT THE WINDSHIELD
 We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.
 MARY IN NEW CAR
 We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an ercom system,
a sound emanating from Mary's imagination.
 After the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.
 CAROLINE'S VOICE
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
 LOWERY'S VOICE
(a worried tone)
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
 CAROLINE'S VOICE
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's
always a bit late on Monday mornings.
 LOWERY'S VOICE
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
 Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing
these "invented" scenes of her imagination.
  HIGHWAY
 Now we  the view of the road, from Mary's viewpo
Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see
the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations
beginning to blaze on.
  MARY'S NEW CAR
 Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices
again:
 LOWERY'S VOICE
Call her sister! If no one's answering
at the house....
 CAROLINE'S VOICE
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery,
where she works, the Music Makers
Music Store, you know? And she doesn't
know where Mary is any more than we
do.
 LOWERY'S VOICE
You better run out to the house.
She may be... unable to answer the
phone...
 CAROLINE'S VOICE
Her sister's going to do that. She's
as worried as we are.
 A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face.
She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.
  HIGHWAY
 We cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights
slash at the windshield.
  MARY'S NEW CAR
 Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of
her face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights
blurt at her.
 Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as
if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break
through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her
imagination blank.
 LOWERY'S VOICE
No! I haven't the faest idea. As
I said, I last saw your sister when
she left this office on Friday...
she said she didn't feel well and
wanted to leave early and I said she
could. And that was the last I saw...
(a pause, a thought)
...wait a minute, I did see her, an
hour or so later, driving...
(a pause, then with
solemn fear)
Ah, I think you'd better come over
here to my office. Quick.
(a pause, a click)
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.
  HIGHWAY
 It is completely dark now, night.
  MARY'S NEW CAR
 We cut back to her face.
 LOWERY'S VOICE
After all, Cassidy, I told you...
all that cash... I'm not taking the
responsibility... Oh, for heaven's
sake, a girl works for you for ten
years, you trust her! All right,
yes, you better come over.
 FROM MARY'S VIEWPO
  THE ROAD AHEAD  MARY'S NEW CAR
 Fast cut back to Mary's face. Oncoming headlights throw a
blinding light across her features.
 CASSIDY'S VOICE
(undrunk, sharp with
rage)
Well I ain't about to kiss off forty
thousand dollars! I'll get it back
and if any of it's missin' I'll
replace it with her fine soft flesh!
I'll track her, never you doubt it!
 LOWERY'S VOICE
Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't
believe... it must be some kind of a
mystery... I can't...
 CASSIDY'S VOICE
You checked with the bank, no? They
never laid eyes on her, no? You
still trustin'? Hot creepers, she
sat there while I dumped it out...
hardly even looked at it, plannin'
and... and even flirtin' with me...!
 A look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.
 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN
 Big drops of rain begin to appear.
 CLOSEUP - MARY
 She is becoming aware of the rain starting.
 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
 The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights.
 CLOSEUP - MARY
 Mary starts the windshield wipers.
 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
 The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.
 CLOSEUP - MARY
 Peering through the blurred windshield.
 CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS
 slowing down in the flooding highway.
 CLOSEUP - MARY
 peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer.
 CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS
 almost coming to a slow turn.
 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
 just blackness and rain.
 CLOSEUP - MARY
 peering.
 MARY'S VIEWPO
 An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon
sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield.
 MARY'S CAR
 She presses down, forces the car to move on through the
flooded road.
  THE ROAD
 As we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can
faly make out the large letters which read "Motel." Mary
stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see
the sign clearly now: "BATES MOTEL." Mary opens the car door
and dashes out o the rain and up onto the porch of the
motel office.
  BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
 Mary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office.
She tries door, finds it open, goes o office. CAMERA
FOLLOWS her o office. There is no one present. Mary goes
to the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response.
Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes
back out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction,
slightly behind the office, and sees...
 MARY'S VIEWPO - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)
 A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house.
There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN
passes the window, pauses, peers out.
 We see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from
the window.
  PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
 Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get
some attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.
 No one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes
out o the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window,
begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open
the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path.
After a few steps, he turns and runs back o the house.
Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the
porch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back
only to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to
the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his
hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached
it.
 He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging
useless in his hand, then back to her.
 There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look.
Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him
almost smile. He gestures her o the office, standing back
to indicate that he will go after her. She goes o the
office.
  OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
 The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN
BATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-
spoken and hesitant.
 NORMAN
Dirty night.
 MARY
(not really a question)
You have a vacancy?
 NORMAN
(simply, almost
cheerfully)
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve
cabins, twelve vacancies.
(a pause)
They moved away the highway.
 MARY
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
 NORMAN
I knew you must have. No one stops
here anymore unless they do.
 He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration
book.
 NORMAN
But it's no good dwelling on our
losses, is it. We go right ahead
lighting signs and following the
formalities... Would you sign,
please.
 Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the
registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with
the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes
the name Marie Samuels.
 NORMAN
Your home address. Oh, just the town
will do.
 MARY
(glancing at newspaper
sticking out of her
handbag)
Los Angeles.
 She realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write
it down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false
name. Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.
 NORMAN
Cabin One. It's closer in case you
want anything... right n to the
office.
 CLOSEUP - NORMAN
 He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a
remaining key on the board.
 TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN
 MARY
I want sleep more than anything.
Except maybe, food.
 NORMAN
There's a big diner about ten miles
on up... just outside Fairvale.
 MARY
Am I that close to Fairvale?
 NORMAN
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
 He goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down
considerably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate
some pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door,
goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to
her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of
Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door
of Cabin One.
 Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door,
opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches
on a light. Mary goes o the cabin. Norman follows her.
  CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)
 Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it.
 NORMAN
Stuffy in here.
(turns to her)
Well... the mattress is soft and
there're hangers in the closet and...
stationary with "Bates' Motel" pred
on it in case you want to make your
friends back home envious... and...
the... over there....
(he pos to the
bathroom, fairly
blushes)
 MARY
The bathroom.
 NORMAN
(quickly, starting to
leave)
I'll be in the office if you want
anything... just tap on the wall.
 MARY
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
 NORMAN
Norman Bates.
 He pauses at the door, gazes at her. She smiles.
 NORMAN
You have something most girls never
have.
 MARY
I have?
 NORMAN
There's no name for it... But it's
something that, that puts a person
at ease.
 MARY
Thank you. Again.
 NORMAN
(not really a question)
You're not going to go out again and
drive up to that diner, are you?
 MARY
No.
 NORMAN
Then will you do me a favor?
(without waiting for
her response)
Will you have supper here? I was
just about to, myself... nothing
more than some sandwiches and a lot
of milk, but I'd like it if you'd
come up to the house and... I don't
set a fancy table but... the kitchen's
awful homey.
 MARY
I'd like to.
 NORMAN
All right, you get your dresses
hanging out and... change those wet
shoes, and I'll come for you soon as
it's ready...
(starts out)
...with my trusty umbrella.
(he laughs a small
laugh, runs off)
 Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to
take out a dress. Her handbag is n to the suitcase. She
glances down o it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches o
the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at
it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides
to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks
about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such
places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her
bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places
the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then
places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later
reading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes
to her suitcase to start unpacking.
 Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of
a woman's voice, raised in anger.
 WOMAN'S VOICE
No! I tell you no!
 Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible
voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA
FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is
still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming
from that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.
 WOMAN'S VOICE
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper...
(an ugly, sneering
note creeps o the
voice)
...by candlelight, I suppose, in the
cheap erotic fashion of young men
with cheap, erotic minds!
 NORMAN'S VOICE
Mother, please...
 WOMAN'S VOICE
And then what? After supper, music?
Whispers?
 NORMAN'S VOICE
Mother, she's just a stranger...
hungry, and the weather's bad...
 WOMAN'S VOICE
(mimicking cruelly)
Mother, she's just a stranger!
(hard, cruel again)
As if men don't desire strangers, as
if... oh, I refuse to speak of
disgusting things because they disgust
me! You understand, Boy?
 WOMAN'S VOICE
(pause)
Go on, go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite with my
food... or my son! Or do I have to
tell her, cause you don't have the
guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts,
boy?
 NORMAN'S VOICE
(blurted cut fury and
shame)
Shut up! Shut up!
 There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there.
Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress
and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes
sadly at the little empty room.
 In a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door
slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.
 FROM MARY'S VIEWPO - (NIGHT)
 We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered
tray.
  CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)
 Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to
the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.
  THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
 Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when
Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch,
past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He
stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her
eye.
 MARY
I've caused you some trouble.
 NORMAN
Mother...
(a hollow little laugh,
an attempt at sardonic
humor)
...what is the phrase... "she isn't
herself today"... I think that's it.
 MARY
(looking at the tray)
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.
 Norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's
reference to Mary's appetite.
 NORMAN
I'm sorry. I wish... people could
apologize for other people.
 MARY
Don't worry about it.
(a warm smile)
But as long as you've made us supper,
we may as well eat it. Huh?
 She begins to back o her room. Norman starts to follow,
hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young
woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in
defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his
defiance for one day. He cannot go o Mary's room.
 NORMAN
It might be nicer... warmer in the
office.
 Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries
to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused
sympathy, then follows.
  THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
 Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable
place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing
in the doorway.
 NORMAN
Eating in an office...
(a rueful smile)
...to officious, even for me. I have
the parlor behind this... if you'd
like.
 Mary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and o the
darkened parlor. Mary follows.
  NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)
 In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office
spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary
comes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to
lamp, turns on the light.
 Mary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one
lamp, the strange, raordinary nature of the room rushes
up at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over
the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to
the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are
of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary
stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.
 CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN
 NORMAN
Please sit down. On the sofa.
 As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and
pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies
the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked
with books on the subject of "Taxidermy."
 CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY
 She notices, too, the paings on the wall; nudes, primarily,
and many with a vaguely religious overtone.
 Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.
 MARY
You're very... kind.
 NORMAN
It's all for you. I'm not hungry.
Please go ahead.
 Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a
small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in
the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.
 Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles
and then laughs.
 NORMAN
You eat like a bird.
 MARY
You'd know, of course.
 NORMAN
Not really. I hear that expression,
that one eats "like a bird," is really
a falsie, I mean a falsity, because
birds eat a tremendous lot.
(A pause, then
explaining)
Oh, I don't know anything about birds.
My hobby is stuffing things...
taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because... well, I hate
the look of beasts when they're
stuffed, foxes and chimps and all...
some people even stuff dogs and
cats... but I can't... I think only
birds look well stuffed because
they're rather... passive, to begin
with... most of them...
 He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return
of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him,
with some compression, smiles.
 MARY
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I
mean.
 NORMAN
Uncommon, too.
 MARY
I imagine so.
 NORMAN
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
Cheap, really. Needles, thread,
sawdust .. the chemicals are all
that cost anything.
(He goes quiet, looks
disturbed)
 MARY
A man should have a hobby.
 NORMAN
It's more than a hobby... sometimes...
a hobby is supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.
 MARY
(after a pause, softly)
Is your time so empty?
 NORMAN
Oh, no!
(forcing brightness
again)
I run the office, tend the cabins
and grounds, do little chores for
mother... the ones she allows I might
be capable of doing.
 MARY
You go out... with friends?
 NORMAN
Friends? Who needs friends.
(Laughs, then with
gallows humor)
A boy's best friend is his mother.
(Stops laughing)
You've never had an empty moment in
your whole life. Have you?
 MARY
Only my share.
 NORMAN
Where are you going? I don't mean to
pry...
 MARY
(A wistful smile)
I'm looking for a private island.
 NORMAN
What are you running away from?
 MARY
(Alert)
Why do you ask that?
 NORMAN
No. People never run away from
anything.
(A pause)
The rain didn't last very long.
(Turning suddenly)
You know what I think? I think we're
all in our private traps, clamped in
them, and none of us can ever climb
out. We scratch and claw... but only
at the air, only at each other, and
for all of it, we never budge an
inch.
 MARY
Sometimes we deliberately step o
those traps.
 NORMAN
I was born in mine. I don't mind it
anymore.
 MARY
You should... mind it.
 NORMAN
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
(Laughs boyishly)
 MARY
(Staring at him,
shaking her head
softly.)
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way
I heard... The way she spoke to you,
I don't think I could ever laugh
again.
 NORMAN
(Controlled resentment)
Sometimes when she talks that way to
me I'd like to... curse her out and
leave her forever!
(A rueful smile)
Or at least, defy her.
(A pause, a hopeless
shrug)
But I couldn't. She's ill.
 MARY
She sounded strong...
 NORMAN
I mean... ill.
(A pause)
She had to raise me all by herself
after my dad died... I was only
five... and it must have been a
strain. Oh, she didn't have to go
out to work or anything, Dad left us
with a little something... anyway, a
few years ago... Mother met a man.
He talked her o building this
motel... We could have talked her
o anything... and when. Well...
It was just too much for her when he
died, too... And the way he died...
Oh, it's nothing to talk about when
you're eating.
(Pauses, smiles)
Anyway, it was too much of a loss
for my mother... she had nothing
left.
 MARY
(Critically)
Except you.
 NORMAN
A son is a poor substitute for a
lover.
(Turns away as if in
distaste of the word)
 MARY
Why don't you go away?
 NORMAN
To a private island, like you?
 MARY
No, not like me.
 NORMAN
It's too late for me. And besides...
who'd look after her? She'd be alone
up there, the fire would go out...
damp and cold, like a grave. When
you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them. Oh,
I don't hate her. I hate... what
she's become. I hate... the illness.
 MARY
(Slowly, carefully)
Wouldn't it be better if you put her
in... someplace...
 She hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a
striking coldness.
 NORMAN
An Institution? A madhouse? People
always call a madhouse "someplace."
(Mimicing coldly)
Put her in Someplace!
 MARY
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to
sound uncaring...
 NORMAN
(The coldness turning
to tight fury)
What do you mean about caring? Have
you ever seen one of those places?
Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel
eyes studying you... and my mother
there? Why? has she harmed you?
She's as harmless as... one of these
stuffed birds.
 MARY
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed
she was harming you. I meant...
 NORMAN
(High fury now)
Well? You meant well? People always
mean well, they cluck their thick
tongues and shake their heads and
suggest so very delicately that...
 The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks
back o his chair. There is a brief silence.
 Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained
by his anguish.
 NORMAN
(Quietly)
I've suggested it myself. But I hate
to even think such a thing. She
needs me... and it isn't...
(Looks up with a
childlike pleading
in his eyes)
...it isn't as if she were a maniac,
a raving thing... it's just that...
sometimes she goes a little mad. We
all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't
you?
 MARY
(After a long
thoughtful pause)
Yes, and just one time can be enough.
(Rises)
Thank you.
 NORMAN
(Cheerfully, correcting)
Thank you, Norman.
 MARY
Norman.
 NORMAN
You're not going to... to your room
already?
 MARY
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long
drive tomorrow. All the way back to
Phoenix.
 NORMAN
Phoenix?
 MARY
I stepped o a private trap back
there -- and I want to go back and...
try to pull myself out.
(Looking close at
Norman)
Before it's too late for me, too.
 NORMAN
(Looking at her)
Why don't you stay a little while,
just for talking.
 MARY
I'd like to, but...
 NORMAN
Alright. I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you breakfast. What time
will you...
 MARY
Very early. Dawn.
 NORMAN
Alright, Miss...
(He has forgotten her
name)
 MARY
Crane.
 NORMAN
That's it.
(He frowns, as if
bothered by not being
able to match the
name to the memory
of the name in the
registration book)
 MARY
Good night.
 She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's
viewpo, as she crosses the small office, goes out o
the night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see
his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of
determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts
to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of
Mary's door in the cabin n door.
 He holds still, listens. He goes o the office and looks
at the book.
 C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"
 M.S. - NORMAN
 He goes back o the parlor with a mystified expression.
The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft
SOUNDS, somehow imate in the night quiet. Norman turns
his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting
an impulse to listen, or more than listen.
 But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and,
resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of
his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too
had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a
picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning
against. Slowly he starts toward it.
 He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame
off the wall.
 A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the
hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is
very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light
striking Norman's face.
 We move close to Norman, remely close, until his profile
fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See
the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps
through.
 NORMAN'S VIEWPO
 Through the hole we look o Mary's cabin, see Mary
undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over
a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to
unhook her bra.
 NORMAN - ECU
 He watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up
and down the unseen figure of Mary.
 NORMAN'S VIEWPO
 Mary, just slipping o a robe, covering her complete nudity.
 NORMAN
 He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues
turning until he can look out the small parlor window.
 We see, as he sees...
 THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
 NORMAN
 He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we
see anger and anguish. And then resolve.
 Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in
the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go
through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering
to close the door behind him.

  THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)
 Norman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big
house. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in
the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his
shoulders, strides manfully up the path.
 CAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house,
enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look
up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He
holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage
evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-
passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen.
At the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops
wearily o a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg
and gently pushes the kitchen door closed.

  MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)
 Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a
small notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which
indicates her ention to make a restitution of the money
she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her
bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly
beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after
subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which
matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.
 Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after
subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not
wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure
that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to
continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the
page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it o
small pieces. She goes o the bathroom, drops the pieces
o the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her
robe and steps o the tub and turns the shower on.
  MARY IN SHOWER
 Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see
the bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch
Mary as she washes and soaps herself.
 There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she
looks somewhat relieved.
 Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.
 The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is
then slowly and carefully closed.
 And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower
curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white
brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.
 Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain,
rip it aside.

 MARY - ECU
 As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower
curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in
her face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her
throat. A hand comes o the shot. The hand holds an enormous
bread knife. The fl of the blade shatters the screen to
an almost total, silver blankness.
 THE SLASHING
 An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very
screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of
screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as
Mary's body falls in the tub.
 REVERSE ANGLE
 The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand
pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a
glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with
madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a
fright-wig. And then we see only the curtain, closed across
the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the
shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a
moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.

 THE DEAD BODY
 Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over,
touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if
popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.
Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along
the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA
FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the
bathroom, past the toilet, out o the bedroom. As CAMERA
approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed
it on the bedside table.
 CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER
 beside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window
and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR,
coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful,
shocked voice.
 NORMAN'S VOICE
Mother! Oh God, what... blood,
blood... mother...!
 We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.
 After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the
front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.
 QUICK :
  THE PATH - (NIGHT)
 Norman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes o
an reme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in
his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman
runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's
room.
  MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)
 Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the
room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open.
He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.
 Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face,
covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the
window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we
see the bedside table with the newspaper on it.
 After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the
edge of the bed.
 FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN
 Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can
see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile
floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of
his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the
peace that comes with decision.
 Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with
resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across
it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch,
and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the
bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from
the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.
  THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
 Norman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully
behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We
stay outside. Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and
then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the
office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door
opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman
comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about,
goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes o
Mary's cabin, closing the door after him.
  MARY'S CABIN
 With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see
him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then
gathers his strength and goes o the bathroom. We HEAR him
set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower
being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES
FORWARD so that we can see o bathroom.
 CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up.
Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges
with it o the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him
spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside
the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of
it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over
and onto the tile floor. Again he goes o the bathroom and
CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman.
He works carefully, with his arms ended away from his
body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it
across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain
in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up,
examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to
the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.
 CLOSE SHOT
 We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being
diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.
 NORMAN
 We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn
to the job of cleaning the bathroom.
 He places the pail in the tub, runs water o it, dips the
mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the
wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and
even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel
and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.
Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail,
cleans out the tub, and goes out o the bedroom.
  MARY'S BEDROOM
 Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to
the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of
her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk,
where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up
the keys, crosses the room, goes out.
  THE PORCH
 We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then
hurry across the porch and o Mary's car. He circle-turns
the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch,
directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.
 Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key
and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back o the cabin.
  MARY'S ROOM
 From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to
wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of
the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he
picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his
foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind
him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body
in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it.
He comes back o the cabin, closes the door completely,
flicks on the light.
 Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he
pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he
is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues
with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to
gather up all Mary's articles and toss them o the suitcase.
He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks
under bed and bureau, goes o the bathroom, checks that
room again, comes back o the bedroom, looks about
carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that o the
suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl
are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks
it up.
 With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the
mop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches
off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts
out.
  THE PORCH
 As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly
lit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of
the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a
flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman
to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the
car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and
the pail o it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then
realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin.
He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the
newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the
newspaper, and looks once again o the bathroom. His glance
goes right over the toilet bowl.
 He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes
out onto the porch.
 He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it.
He goes around and jumps o the car and starts away.
 We HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then
 DISSOLVE TO:
  THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
 The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as
CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.
 It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects.
Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns
off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the
swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car,
realizes he has no choice. He leans o the car, releases
the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car
begins to roll o the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW,
THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.
 The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane
flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps
away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the
plane overhead grows louder.
 Norman looks up.
 NORMAN'S VIEWPO - THE BLACK SKY
 We see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to
diminish.
 CUT BACK TO:
 NORMAN
 We see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.
 More than two-thirds of it have already sunk o the swamp.
The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime,
as if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to
panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And
slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear
only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only
the small after-bubble, like a visual burp.
 Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire
marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.
 He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:
 DISSOLVE TO:
 CLOSE UP NORMAN
 standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post.
He is staring out o the night, a look of guarded, casual
innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment
of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down
and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground
outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the
tire marks.
 After a moment, Norman's hand comes o shot, picks up hose,
places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see
that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the
road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a
car had been parked here.
 After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it
off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away
from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that
leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps
of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up
the steps and o the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES
as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the
stairs.
 On the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is
closed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained
dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an REMELY
HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up
the stained dress and shoes.
 He rolls the shoes o the dress, tucks the small, neat
bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading
for the basement.
  A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)
 It stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait.
Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.
 FADE OUT:
 FADE IN
  BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)
 Sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence
 begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can
read as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead
reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest
right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room
which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks
big enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped
and miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come
to your senses, and still want to...
 CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper
over, continues backing away out of the small back room and
heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk,
BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter,
a look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a
meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and
examining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:
 WOMAN CUSTOMER
...They tell you what its ingredients
are and how it's guaranteed to
erminate any insect in the world,
but they do not tell you whether or
not it's painless. And I say insect
or man, death should always be
painless.
 CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware
store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door.
She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a
look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small
overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.
 Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her,
gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.
 Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her
eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:
 LILA
Sam?
 SUMMERFIELD
You want to see Sam?
 LILA
Sam Loomis.
 SUMMERFIELD
(yelling toward back
room)
Sam! Lady wants to see you!
 Lila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on
worriedly examining the fine pr of the insecticide can.
Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a
moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he
does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried
expression.
 SAM
Yes?
 LILA
May I talk to you?
 SAM
(a bit mystified)
Sure...
 Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts
toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then
follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him
ently as she says:
 LILA
I'm Mary's sister.
 SAM
Lila.
 LILA
(quickly)
Is Mary here?
 Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile
expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment.
Behind them is a display of various size carving knives.
 SAM
Is something wrong?
 LILA
I want to know if my sister is here.
 SAM
Here?
 LILA
With you.
 SAM
Where?
 LILA
I don't know where. In your store,
somewhere in your town... anywhere.
 SAM
What's the matter?
 LILA
Don't you know?
 As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing
past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.
 WOMAN CUSTOMER
All I can do is hope if it isn't
painless, it's quick!
 She speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods
happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring
apprehensively at Lila.
 SAM
What should I know?
 LILA
To begin with, where Mary is. Do
you?
 SAM
No. I take it you don't either?
(As Lila shakes her
head)
How long?
 LILA
Last Friday. She left work, and
home... I was in Tucson over the
weekend... I haven't heard from her,
not even a phone call.
 SAM
And you thought she'd come up here,
to me? If she had, what reason would
she have for not calling you?
 LILA
A good reason, I suppose.
 SAM
(Slightly exasperated)
Well what do you think, we eloped or
something? Or we're living in sin
and...
 LILA
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being
defensive that you haven't even
reacted to the most serious fact of
all. Mary is missing.
 SAM
I was getting to that!
 LILA
What do you know about it?
 SAM
Nothing! You're putting me on the
defensive.
 LILA
Look, if you two are in this thing
together, I don't care, it's none of
my business... But I want to see
Mary. I want her to tell me she's
all right and it's none of my
business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix
and...
 She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes
beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a
moment, then turns and calls:
 SAM
Bob? Run out and get yourself some
lunch.
 SUMMERFIELD
It's okay, Sam, I brought it with
me.
 SAM
Run out and eat it.
 Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way.
 Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.
 SAM
What thing?
 LILA
Huh?
 SAM
What thing could we be in together?
 LILA
(A pause)
I hate tears.
(Takes out hankie)
 SAM
Is Mary... in trouble?
 LILA
Yes.
 SAM
Well why didn't she come to me...
call me...?
 LILA
Not that kind...
(Almost a smile)
You men and your egos.
 SAM
(Seriously)
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about
Mary.
 Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled
quietly o the room. He ignores them, walks past them,
goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "CLOSED
FOR LUNCH," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the
sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam
and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly
smile.
 ARBOGAST
Let's all talk about Mary.
 SAM
Who are you, friend?
 ARBOGAST
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.
(To Lila)
Where is she, Miss Crane?
 LILA
I don't know.
 ARBOGAST
Wouldn't have been able to tail you
if you did.
 SAM
What's your erest?
 ARBOGAST
Money.
 There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the
sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes.
 SAM
Somebody better tell me what's going
on and tell me fast! I can take so
much and then...
 ARBOGAST
(errupting calmly)
Your girl friend stole forty thousand
dollars.
 Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks
one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.
 SAM
Why?
 ARBOGAST
(An almost amused
smile)
Must've needed it.
 SAM
What are you talking about?
(To Lila)
What is this?
 LILA
She was supposed to bank it, on
Friday, for her boss. She didn't.
 And no one has seen her since.
 ARBOGAST
(Looking at Sam)
Someone has seen her. Someone always
sees a girl with forty thousand
dollars.
(To Sam)
She is your girl friend, isn't she?
 LILA
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back. It
was all in cash...
 ARBOGAST
(Correcting with
Cassidy's word)
Casharoonie!
 LILA
Sam, if she's here...
 SAM
She isn't!
 A real look of anguish comes o Lila's face. And Arbogast
studies it, then speaks.
 ARBOGAST
You came up here on a hunch, Miss
Crane? Nothing more? No phone call...
from him, or from your sister herself?
 LILA
(wearily)
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
 ARBOGAST
With a little checking, I could get
to believe you.
 LILA
(anxiously)
I don't care if you do or... I want
to see Mary... before she gets in
any deeper...
 SAM
Did you check in Phoenix...
hospitals... maybe she had an
accident... a hold-up...
 ARBOGAST
She was seen leaving town in her
car. Seen by her very victims, I
might add.
 SAM
(after a moment)
I don't believe it.
(to Lila, slowly)
Do you?
 LILA
(a thoughtful pause)
Yes... I just... did. The moment
they told me...
 SAM
You might have doubted for say five
minutes or so, Sister.
 Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face.
Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.
 ARBOGAST
We're always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest.
I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where
there's a boyfriend...
(Trails off, smiles
encouragingly)
She won't be back there among the
nuts and bolts... but she'll be in
this town... somewhere. I'll find
her.
 He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to
the counter, opens door, goes out o the street.
 After a quiet moment:
 LILA
I just listened... and believed
everything they told me. 'She stole
the money.' 'We don't want to get
her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the
police in'...
 SAM
It was her boss' idea not to report
it to the police?
 LILA
No. The man whose money she... he
talked so loud and fast, and I... I
should've called the police.
 SAM
He must have had a darn good reason
for wanting them kept out of it...
All that cash...
 LILA
I ought to call the police right
now!
 SAM
No.
 LILA
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here?
Are you two planning to go away with
the money?
 SAM
How could I go away? I'm in debt up
to my...
(Smiles at the
incongruity of his
reply, then goes
serious)
If she did steal that money... It's
hard to believe she did because it's
hard to see why she would. Unless
she had some wild idea that it would
help me... us...
 LILA
She haven't even called you?
 SAM
I didn't see her... and I didn't
hear from her! Believe that!
 LILA
I need to... I need to believe
something. This is the first time
I've ever come up against anything I
couldn't... understand.
 SAM
You've led a charmed life.
 LILA
No. I just think... anything can be
explained. But Mary, doing a thing
like this... I don't know how to
handle...
 SAM
Maybe we can handle it together.
(He smiles
encouragingly)
 LILA
(A rueful shrug)
I came flying up here expecting to
get some explanation... for all I
know, she may be trying to get in
touch with me, at home. I'd better
go home.
 SAM
(A thoughtful pause)
I think she'll contact me if she
contacts anybody. Why don't you stay
here. When she shows up... or calls...
be here.
 LILA
(A long study, her
suspicion of him
evaporating)
You want me to stay here?
 SAM
She'll need both of us.
 LILA
(considers, then:)
Where... can I stay?
 SAM
(brightly)
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the
street. Come on.
(as he reaches for
the closed-for-lunch
sign)
After we check you in we'll go to
the drugstore and get you a sandwich.
Then we'll come back here... and
wait.
 He hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door
behind him.

  STREET - (DAY)
 They emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel. As
they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white
Ford sedan from a rental car man. They glance at him and he
returns a cynical look.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  HOTEL - (DAY)
 Outside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white
car and go o new hotel.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  COUNTRYSIDE - (DAY)
 The white car speeding along the highway.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  NEW MOTEL - (DAY)
 Arbogast going o the office - we see the sign above him.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)
 A high shot showing the freeway and Bates house and motel on
the side old highway. A pause and then across the bottom of
the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  HOTEL - (DUSK)
 Another Hotel. Arbogast goes in.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)
 The white car speeding along the freeway again going in the
opposite direction to last time. Norman, a tiny figure, is
seen going up the steps to his mother's house.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  BOARDING HOUSE - (DAY)
 Arbogast's search is getting down in the scale. This is an
entrance to a cheesy boarding house. "Rooms to Rent," etc.
He looks at his list and then goes in.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)
 The white car goes by on the freeway again.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  ROOMING HOUSE - (DAY)
 Arbogast goes in.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  BATES' MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)
 Heavy traffic on the freeway. A beat or two - again the white
car. It slows up opposite the distant motel. It makes a turn
and goes back out of scene. A pause and it reappears on the
old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates' Motel.
  THE BATES' HOUSE AND MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)
 We now see Norman. He has brought out an old rocking chair
and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched
in it. And he is darning one of his own socks. CAMERA HOLDS.
Beyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can
barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his
mother seated at the window. Here, too, there is that quality
of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding.
 Now Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car.
 And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast
gets out. Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes
at Norman, starts forward. In his steps and manner there is
that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too
many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers
over too short a period of time.
 Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward.
 NORMAN
(shoving sock in his
pocket)
I always forget to put the sign on,
but we do have vacancy.
(Cheerfully)
Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve
vacancies.
 ARBOGAST
(pleasantly)
In the past two days I've been to so
many motels, my eyes are bleary with
neon. This is the first one that
looked like it was hiding from the
world at large.
 NORMAN
I don't really forget the sign, it
just doesn't seem... any use.
(Pos)
This used to be the main highway.
(Starts for office)
Want to register, please?
 ARBOGAST
Sit down. I don't want to trouble
you, just want to ask...
 NORMAN
No trouble. Today's linen day. I
change all the beds once a week,
whether they've been used or not...
dampness. I hate the smell of
dampness.
(Opening office door)
It's such a dank smell.
 Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in.
 Norman follows.
  MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT)
 Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen
closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has
remained standing by the door.
 NORMAN
You out to buy a motel?
 ARBOGAST
No.
 NORMAN
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been
to so many in two days... What was
it you wanted to ask?
 ARBOGAST
I'm looking for a missing person.
(takes out and opens
wallet and ends
it as he speaks)
My name's Arbogast, private
investigator...
(takes back wallet
when Norman doesn't
look at it)
Trying to trace a young girl who's
been missing almost a week. From
Phoenix.
(A look at Norman's
frightened expression)
It's a private matter... family wants
to forgive her...
(smiles)
She isn't in trouble.
 NORMAN
(forcing a smile)
I didn't think the police went
searching for people who weren't in
trouble.
 ARBOGAST
I'm not the police.
 NORMAN
Oh.
 He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out
sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.
 Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he
crosses to Norman.
 ARBOGAST
We have reason to believe she came
this way... might have stopped in
this area...
(ends photograph,
which Norman doesn't
glance at)
Did she stop here?
 NORMAN
No. No one has stopped here in
weeks...
 ARBOGAST
Mind looking at the picture before
committing yourself?
 NORMAN
Committing myself to what? You sure
talk like a Policeman.
 ARBOGAST
Look at the picture. Please.
 Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow
cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively.
 NORMAN
No. At least I don't recall.
 ARBOGAST
She might have used an alias. Mary
Crane's the real name, but she
might've registered...
 NORMAN
(errupting)
I don't even bother with guests
registering any more... I mean, little
by little, you drop the formalities.
(more relaxed, because
Arbogast is listening
with a pleasant smile)
I shouldn't even bother to change
the linen. I guess habits die hard.
Which reminds me...
 He goes to the wall, flips a light switch.
 NORMAN
The vacancy sign. Just in case.
 We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't
been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining
town or something.
 ARBOGAST
Now there's a couple even remarking
about your sign, and see how easily
you forgot them?
 NORMAN
What?
 ARBOGAST
You thought no one has stopped here
in weeks. Now, try to remember if
this girl...
 ARBOGAST
(A pause, a study)
Maybe she even signed the register...
because habits die hard. Let's check
it, huh?
 Norman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the
registry book around, flips back a page or two.
 Norman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faly,
pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:
 ARBOGAST
Yes sir! Marie Samuels. eresting
alias.
 He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside
the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding
and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as
happy as it is making him.
 ARBOGAST
Don't know where she got "Marie,"
but "Samuels" figures. Her boy
friend's name is Sam.
(Turns to Norman, the
smile gone)
Was she in disguise? Or do you want
to check the picture again?
 NORMAN
I didn't lie to you. I just have
trouble keeping track of... time.
 Arbogast has reached him, the picture ended. Norman looks
dutifully at it.
 NORMAN
It was raining and her hair didn't
look like that... damped out, I guess.
 ARBOGAST
Tell me all about her.
 NORMAN
She arrived kind of late, wet and
hungry and she was very tired and
went right to bed and left early.
 ARBOGAST
How early?
 NORMAN
Very early. Dawn.
 ARBOGAST
Of which morning?
 NORMAN
The following morning. Sunday.
 ARBOGAST
No one met her?
 NORMAN
No.
 ARBOGAST
Or arrived with her.
 NORMAN
No.
 ARBOGAST
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
 NORMAN
No.
 ARBOGAST
You didn't spend the whole night
with her did you?
 NORMAN
No! Of all...
 ARBOGAST
How do you know she didn't make a
call?
 NORMAN
She was tired. She said she had a
long drive ahead of her, in the
morning... Yes, now I'm remembering
very clearly because I'm picturing.
When you make a picture of the moment
in your mind, you can remember every
detail. She was sitting back there,
no she was standing up, with some
sandwich still in her hand, and she
said she had to drive a long way.
 ARBOGAST
Back where?
 NORMAN
What do you mean?
 ARBOGAST
You said she was sitting "back there,"
or standing rather...
 NORMAN
Oh. My private parlor. She had an
awful hunger... so I made her some
supper. And then she went to bed and
left in the morning. I didn't even
see her leave.
 ARBOGAST
How did she pay you?
 NORMAN
What?
 ARBOGAST
Cash or check? For the cabin...
 NORMAN
Cash.
 ARBOGAST
And when she left, she never came
back.
 NORMAN
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have
work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
 ARBOGAST
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't
aspic!
(smiles)
This ain't jelling.
 NORMAN
I don't know what you expect me to
know about... people come and go...
 ARBOGAST
She isn't still here, is she?
 NORMAN
Not at all!
 ARBOGAST
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins,
all twelve... would I need a warrant?
 NORMAN
(as if pleasantly
exasperated)
Look, if you won't believe me, go
ahead. You can help me make beds if
you like.
(laughs, shakes his
head)
Come on.
 He starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the
young man's openness.

  THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
 Norman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One,
walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if
Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch,
but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of
the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old
house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the
Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene.
 NORMAN
Change your mind?
 Arbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts
to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.
 NORMAN
I guess I've got one of those faces
you can't help believing.
 ARBOGAST
(to Norman, but
continuing to stare
at the house)
Anyone at home?
 NORMAN
I live there. Alone.
 ARBOGAST
Someone is sitting in that window.
 NORMAN
My mother.
 Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.
 NORMAN
She's... ill. Confined to her room.
It's practically living alone.
 ARBOGAST
(after a pause)
If this girl Mary Crane were here,
you'd have no reason to hide her
would you?
 NORMAN
Of course not.
 ARBOGAST
If she paid you well?
 NORMAN
Now, look...!
 ARBOGAST
Or if she had you say... gallantly
protecting her... you wouldn't be
fooled... you'd know she was just
using you. Wouldn't you?
 NORMAN
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable
of being fooled! Not even by women!
 ARBOGAST
I didn't mean that as a slur on your
manhood. I'm sorry.
 NORMAN
(disturbed now)
That's all right. maybe she could
have fooled me. But...
(a rueful smile)
She didn't fool my mother.
 ARBOGAST
Your mother met her?
(quickly)
Can I talk to your mother?
 NORMAN
No. I told you, she's confined...
 ARBOGAST
Just for a moment. She might have
picked up a h you'd miss.
 ARBOGAST
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I
won't disturb...
 NORMAN
No! Just no! I have one of those
breaking pos like any other man,
believe it or not, and I'm near it.
There's just so much pushing I can
take and I think...
 ARBOGAST
All right!
(starts away, toward
his car, pauses)
Might save me a lot of leg-work if I
could just talk to your mother. But
I'd need a warrant for that, won't
I?
 Norman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts
the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own
face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around
very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the
lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his
headlights light up the porch.
 Norman stands, watching him drive away.
  PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)
 The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor
running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA
PULLS AWAY and we

  HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)
 Arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS
FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from
his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and
dial this number. As we reach phone booth,

 ARBOGAST
(o phone)
Miss Crane, please.
(listens)
She leave a number?
(listens)
Thanks.
(hangs up, dials again,
waits)
Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast.
(waits)
Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it
might make you feel a little better.
Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday
night at Bates' Motel, out here on
the old highway.
(listens)
Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent
the night, left, period!
(listens)
I did question him, believe me. I
think I got all there was to get.
Just have to try to pick up the scent
from here.
(listens)
Well... maybe that's because I don't
feel entirely satisfied. He's got a
sick old mother, confined type, and
I think she saw Mary and talked to
her. Shame, too... confined old women
love to talk to strangers.
(listens)
I was, but I think I'll go back to
the motel, first.
(listens)
No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis.
I should be back in an hour.
(listens)
All right. And Lila... You'll be
happy to know what I think. I think
our friend Sam Loomis didn't even
know Mary was here.
(smiles)
See you in an hour. Or less.
 He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
 A distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on
in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office.
We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch
toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He
goes o the last cabin and switches the light on. o the
foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and
stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office.
  MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
 Arbogast goes in.
  OFFICE - (NIGHT)
 Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls.
 ARBOGAST
Bates!
 He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks
around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees:
 C.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER
 C.U. - ARBOGAST
 goes over to it. He finds it unlocked. With a quick, cautious
look around he opens it.
 C.U. - THE EMPTY SAFE
 C.U. - ARBOGAST
 straightens up and goes out.
  MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
 Arbogast comes out and looks off. He sees:
 THE LAST LIT CABIN
 The door ajar.
 C.U. - ARBOGAST - (NIGHT)
 would go along but he stops with a new thought. He turns
around and looks off.
 L.S. - THE OLD HOUSE FROM HIS VIEWPO - (NIGHT)
 C.U. - ARBOGAST
 comes to a decision. He goes off.
 L.S. ARBOGAST
 dashes up the stone steps to the House.
 MEDIUM SHOT
 CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house
is dark within except, as we can now see, for a fa spill
of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs
hall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in,
sees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for
along moment, hears nothing.
 Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door
and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins
to open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip
through and o the foyer.

  FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT)
 Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it,
waiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no
one. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast
listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds
coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the
sounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait,
he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly,
placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks
or groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA
FOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the
stairway as Arbogast makes his way up.

 REMELY HIGH ANGLE
  STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING
 We see Arbogast coming up the stairs. And now we see, too,
the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly.
 As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother
steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous
knife flashing.
 C.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST
 The knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts.
The sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back
and staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically
gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the
stairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife
keeps thrusting itself o the foreground. As he collapses
at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates
plunges o the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain
the raising and descending murder weapon.
 FADE OUT
 FADE IN
  BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)
 Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't
moved from it in the last hour. Sam is pacing, occasionally
stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. The ash
tray close to Lila is filled.
 There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness
in the small, otherwise cozy room.
 SAM
(at window, quietly)
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice, Lila?
 LILA
(unable to keep up
small talk)
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
 SAM
It's been three.
 LILA
Are we just going to go on sitting
here?
 SAM
(suddenly cheerful)
He'll be back. Let's sit still and
hang on, okay?
 LILA
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
 SAM
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
 LILA
Whenever I start contemplating the
panic button, your back straightens
up and your eyes get that God-looks-
out-for-everybody look and... I feel
better.
 SAM
I feel better when you feel better.
 LILA
(a pause - then she
rises)
Where's the old highway?
 SAM
You want to run out there, bust in
on Arbogast and the sick old lady,
shake her up and maybe spoil
everything Arbogast's been building
for the last three hours.
 LILA
Yes.
 SAM
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
 LILA
Patience doesn't run in our family.
Sam, I'm going out there!
 SAM
Arbogast said...
 LILA
An hour! Or less!
 Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real
anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.
 SAM
(o phone)
Got the number of the motel out on
the old highway? Bates, I think.
(waits)
 LILA
Sam! Why call when we can go?
 SAM
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?
(o phone)
Thanks.
 He presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates'
 Motel. The fa other-end ringing tones can be heard,
repeatedly, annoyingly. He waits.
 SAM
(to Lila)
Probably on his way back right now.
 LILA
Sam, I'm going.
 SAM
(hangs up and picks
up his jacket)
You'll never find it.
 He starts for the door. Lila follows after him o the store.
  STORE
 He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms.
 SAM
Stay here.
 LILA
Why can't I go out there with you?
 SAM
(looks at her)
I don't know...
(he collects himself)
One of us has to be here in case
Arbogast's on the way.
 LILA
(nervously)
Just wait here?
 SAM
(a warm smile)
Contemplate your... panic button.
 He hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on
Lila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the
darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister
shapes.
 C.U.
 Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls
onto the floor.
 MEDIUM SHOT
 Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in
its place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street
with a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious
shiver.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
 Tall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of
Norman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at
the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet
face of it.

  THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)
 All light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's
room. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window,
relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned o the room.
After a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's
small pick-up truck swings o the driveway.
 Sam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights,
pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area.
Then he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office,
knocks on the door. As he waits for a response, he looks
down the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks
again, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the
house and the figure at the one lit window. He stares a moment
then calls loudly:
 SAM
Arbogast?

  THE SWAMP
 The silhouette of Norman. He is still. Over shot, very dimly,
comes the SOUND OF SAM'S VOICE, calling again for Arbogast.
 Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile,
his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in
the direction of the house. There is silence for a moment,
and then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)
 The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room
spilling in.
 L.S.
 With CAMERA placed with its back to the street door, we can
see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in
the back room beyond. There is a SOUND of a car pulling up.
The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back
room down the aisle of hardware and comes o a BIG HEAD.
We see Lila's desperate anxious look.
 MEDIUM SHOT
 From her viewpo we see Sam alighting from his truck and
coming toward the door of the store. He enters. He and Lila
exchange quiet glances.
 SAM
He didn't come back here?
 LILA
(worriedly)
Sam.
 SAM
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the
old lady at home...
(frowning)
A sick old lady unable to answer the
door... or unwilling.
 LILA
Where could he have gone?
 SAM
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on...
 LILA
Without calling me?
 SAM
In a hurry.
 LILA
Sam, he called me when he had nothing
definite, nothing but a dissatisfied
feeling. Don't you think he'd have
called if he had anything...
 SAM
(errupting)
Yes. I think he would have.
 Lila goes quiet. Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at
the doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking
out at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a
moment they share at each other across the darkened room.
 SAM
Let's go see Al Chambers.
 LILA
Who's he?
 SAM
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
 As he starts forward.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)
 A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses
dim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the
street, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA
MOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the
truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.
 SAM
Our Deputy sleeps.
 LILA
Well?
 SAM
Nothing. Just... all the lights
out... must be asleep.
 LILA
(a small exasperation)
Does that mean we can't...
 SAM
No. I'm just procrastinating. People
hate when the doorbell rings in the
middle of the night.
(gives up, starts out)
Come on.
 He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already
out. CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door.
Sam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost
knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST
OF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like
a fire alarm than a doorbell.
 He tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The
downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is
unhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick
of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of
hospitality.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Oh?
 SAM
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering
you...
 MRS. CHAMBERS
You didn't!
(a cross look up at
the bell)
It's tinkerbell.
(a quick smile at
Lila)
Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if
anyone rings it in the middle of the
night.
(to Sam)
Well come on in, at least!
 As she opens the door wide,

  DOWNSTAIRS HALL OF SHERIFF'S HOUSE - (NIGHT)
 Fat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted.
The lighting is bright.
 There is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch.
Mrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Albert!
(a tiny wait, a smile
as Sam and Lila enter)
Al Chambers!
 Sam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers
motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans
outside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is
even more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the
stairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER
SHOT.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Customers!
 SHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which
matches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face
originally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks
at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern.
 SAM
We have a problem.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
(to Lila)
Let's go out back and have some coca
while the men are talking.
 LILA
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
 SAM
I don't know where to start...
(a look at Lila)
Except at the beginning.
 LILA
Yes.
 SAM
(to Sheriff)
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.
She's been here for a few days,
looking for her sister. There's a
private detective helping... and,
well, we got a call tonight, from
this detective, saying he'd traced
Mary...
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Mary is Lila's sister?
 SAM
Yes. He traced her to that motel,
out on the old highway...
 MRS. CHAMBERS
(to the Sheriff)
Bates' Motel.
(to Lila)
He has a mind like a mechanical brain
and the more information you feed
it... Go on, Sam.
 SAM
He traced her there and called us to
say he was going to question Mrs.
Bates...
 MRS. CHAMBERS
(a pleasant shock)
Norman took a wife?
 SAM
No. An old woman, his mother.
(to Sheriff, quickly)
That was early this evening. And we
haven't seen or heard from him since.
I went out to the motel, just got
back. No one was in the office, and...
 LILA
(errupting,
anxiously)
Will you help us? I think something's
wrong out there!
 SHERIFF
(after a considerate
pause)
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
 LILA
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday.
And no trace until...
 SHERIFF
How'd you and this detective come to
trace her to Fairvale?
 SAM
They thought she'd be coming to me.
 SHERIFF
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
 LILA
Yes.
 SHERIFF
(a pause)
She ain't missing so much as she's
run away.
 SAM
Yes.
 SHERIFF
From what?
 LILA
(a look at sam, then:)
She stole some money.
 SHERIFF
A lot?
 LILA
Forty thousand dollars.
 SHERIFF
And the police haven't been able
to...
 SAM
(errupting)
Everyone concerned thought... if
they could get her to give back the
money... they could avoid involving
her with the police.
 SHERIFF
Explains the private detective. He
traced her to the Bates place. What'd
he exactly say when he called you?
 LILA
Mary had been there, one night, and
had left.
 SHERIFF
With the forty thousand dollars?
 LILA
He didn't mention the money.
(anxiously)
What he said on the phone isn't
important, is it? He was supposed
to come back after he spoke to the
mother, and he didn't! That's what I
want you to do something about!
 SHERIFF
Like what?
 LILA
Go out there! Find somebody, ask
some questions!
(a pause)
I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to
you. I keep thinking... something's
wrong. I have to know what!
 SHERIFF
I think something's wrong, too, Miss.
But not the same thing. I think your
private detective is what's wrong.
(As Lila is about to
object)
I think he got himself a hot lead as
to where your sister was going...
probably from Norman Bates... and
called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.
 LILA
He said he was dissatisfied... and
was going back.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
(to Sheriff)
Why don't you call Norman and let
him say just what happened, if he
give the man a hot lead and he did
just scooted off... it'll make the
girl feel better, Albert.
 SHERIFF
At this hour?
 SAM
He was out when I was there. If he's
back he probably isn't even in bed
yet.
 SHERIFF
He wasn't out when you were there.
He just wasn't answering the door in
the dead of night... like some people
do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Recluse. Kinder word.
 SHERIFF
(to Sam)
You must remember that bad business
out there. About ten years ago...
 SAM
I've only been here five. Right now
it feels like ten, but...
 LILA
All right! Then call! At least, call!
 Mrs. Chambers goes to phone, dials operator.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
(o phone)
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.
 She hands the receiver to the Sheriff. He takes it,
reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other
end. After a moment:
 SHERIFF
(o phone)
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
(listens)
Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we
got some worries here. Did you have
a man stop out there tonight...
(listens)
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer,
anyway. A private detective, name
of...
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Arbogast.
 SHERIFF
(o phone)
Arbogast.
(listens)
And after he left?
(listens)
No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been
going out there?
(listens)
Well, I think you oughta unload that
place and open up closer in to the
action, a smaller place, you know...
but...
 LILA
Please!
 SHERIFF
(o phone)
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to
sleep. Yeah, be glad to.
(hangs up, turns to
Mrs. Chambers)
Said to give you his regards.
 SAM
(fa irony)
Was that all?
 SHERIFF
This detective was out there and
Norman told him about the girl and
the detective thanked him and went
away.
 LILA
And he didn't go back? Didn't see
the mother?
 The Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head
sympathetically.
 SHERIFF
You should've called in the police
the second you found your sister has
skipped. You go starting private
investigations, using people you
don't even know...
 LILA
What difference does that...
 SHERIFF
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced
lie.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Barefaced.
 SHERIFF
He told you he wasn't coming right
back cause he wanted to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?
 LILA
Yes.
 SHERIFF
(a pause, then calmly)
Norman Bates' mother has been dead
and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for
the last ten years!
 There is a long silence. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
 SHERIFF
It ain't only local history, Sam,
it's the only murder-and-suicide
case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.
Bates poisoned this guy she was...
involved with, when she found out he
was married, then took a helping of
the same stuff herself. Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Norman found them dead together. In
bed.
 SAM
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Norman Bates'
mother?
 MRS. CHAMBERS
(hopefully, happily)
Maybe you saw Mary!
 SAM
I'd know the difference between Mary
and an old woman.
 SHERIFF
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you
saw an old woman?
 SAM
Yes! In the house behind the motel.
I pounded and called but she... just
ignored me.
 SHERIFF
And you want to tell me you saw Norman
Bates' mother.
 LILA
It must've been. Arbogast said so,
too... and he said the young man
wouldn't let him see her because she
was ill!
 The Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks
there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.
 SHERIFF
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs.
Bates... who's that woman buried out
at Greenlawn Cemetery?
 QUICK :
  NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)
 Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone n to
him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to
move his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-
like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and
resolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he
rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off
the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking
the bird off the shade.
 He watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the
floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at
it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust,
tries to press it o the split seam, picks up the bird,
puts it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out,
crosses the darkened office and goes outside.

  MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)
 Norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly
up to the house, opens the door and goes in.

  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)
 SHOOTING UP THE STAIRS
 Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door,
then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open.
 For a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his
words indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his
mother's derisive laughter.
 MOTHER'S VOICE
I am sorry, boy, but you do manage
to look ludicrous when you give me
orders!
 NORMAN'S VOICE
Please, mother...
 MOTHER'S VOICE
(Sharp, laughter all
gone)
No! I will not hide in the fruit
cellar!
(A shrill laugh)
Think I'm fruity, huh?
(Hard, cold again)
I'm staying right here! This is my
room and no one will drag me out of
it... least of all my big bold son!
 NORMAN'S VOICE
(Rising now, anxiously)
They'll come now, Mother. He came
after the girl and now someone will
come after him! How long do you think
you can go on... Mother, please,
just for a few days, just so they
won't find you!
 MOTHER'S VOICE
(Mimicking)
Just for a few days...
(Furious)
In that dank fruit cellar? No! You
hid me there once, boy, and you won't
do it again! Not ever again! Now
get out!
(A pause, quiet)
I told you to get out, boy!
(A longer pause)
Norman! What do you think you're
going to do? Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!
(A pause, then
cajolingly)
All right, son, put me down and I'll
go. I'll go on my own two feet. I
can go on my own two feet, can't I?
 During all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the
stairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues
on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.
 She starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.
 NORMAN'S VOICE
I'll carry you, mother.
 Norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms,
her head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down
the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs,
and then down those stairs to the basement.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)
 An overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is
just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little
I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as
they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways
away.
 Amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam
and Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no
contentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking.
Lila looks as if she has had no sleep.
 Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward
the church.
 CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and
Mrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at
Lila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely.
 SAM
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd
go out to the motel with you.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
He's already been.
 SHERIFF
Went out before service.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
Have you two had breakfast?
 SAM
(To Sheriff, not a
question)
You didn't find anything.
 SHERIFF
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
 He moves away and the others follow. CAMERA PANS them to the
curb.
 LILA
(errupting)
Did he say anything about my sister?
 SHERIFF
Just what he told your detective.
 She used a fake name, saw the register myself. Saw the whole
place, as a matter of fact. That boy is alone there.
 SAM
No mother.
 SHERIFF
You must've seen an illusion, Sam.
Now, I know you're not the seeing-
illusion type... But no woman was
illusion there and I don't believe
in ghosts, so there it is!
 LILA
I still feel...
 SHERIFF
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't
make you feel better. You want to
come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person... And the
theft, is what you want to do! Sooner
you drop this thing in the lap of
the law, that's the sooner you'll
stand a chance of your sister bein'
picked up. How about that?
 LILA
I don't know.
 MRS. CHAMBERS
It's Sunday. Come over and do the
reporting at the house, 'round dinner
time. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.
 She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss
this year's charity fandango, takes the
 Sheriff's arm, starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes.
 Sam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted
chapel. For a long moment they just stand there, their faces
as gray and overcast as the sky.
 SAM
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
 LILA
You're not.
 Sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward
the spot where his pick-up truck is parked.
 CAMERA FOLLOWS them.
 SAM
Want me to drop you at the hotel?
Or you want to come over to the store?
 Lila does not answer. They reach the truck. Lila looks
directly at Sam as he helps her o the cab.
 LILA
I won't feel satisfied unless I got
out there, Sam.
 SAM
Neither will I.
 He slams the door, hurries around truck, gets o driver's
seat, starts motor. As the truck drives off,
 DISSOLVE TO:
 SAM AND LILA IN TRUCK - (PROCESS - HIGHWAY)
 For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if
there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in
particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.
 LILA
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
 SAM
Of course we will.
 LILA
Alive.
 Sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something
to cheer her. He cannot. He remains silent.
 LILA
We lived together all our lives.
 When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans,
Mary quit college and got a job, so I could go to college.
 SAM
Where'd you go to college?
 LILA
I didn't. I got a job, too.
(A pause)
I wonder if that hurt her, my not
letting her sacrifice for me? Some
people are so willing to suffer for
you that they suffer more if you
don't let them.
 SAM
(Almost to himself)
She was willing to lick the stamps.
 Lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue
it.
 LILA
I wonder so many things about her
now. Why she never told me about
you... Funny, when you think there's
an answer to everything, you think
you know all the answers.
 SAM
We were going to get married. Are
going to get married!
 LILA
Do you know how I found out about
you? I found one of your letters...
it was a nice letter, Sam.
 SAM
This is the old highway.
 LILA
I suppose... when you were able to
marry her she'd have presented you,
all shiny and proper... she always
tried to be proper.
 SAM
Watch your tenses.
 LILA
Huh?
 SAM
She always tries to be proper.
 Sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a
cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.
 LILA
You going to wait here for me?
 SAM
I'm going with you. But we'd better
decide what we're going to say and
do when we walk in...
 LILA
We're going to register. As man and
wife. And get shown to a cabin...
and then search every inch of that
place, inside and... outside.
 SAM
You won't believe it...
(Starts motor)
But this will be the first time
I've ever pulled one of those man-
and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
 LILA
(A tiny smile, first
in hours)
I believe it.
 As truck starts to drive on,

  THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)
 The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep
gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning o the
driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila
get out of the truck.
 FRESH ANGLE
 Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the
truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in
b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then
turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the
window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door,
peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the
driveway, beside the truck.

  THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)
 CLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled
the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at
the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is
standing by the truck and looking up at the house. Norman
studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he
closes the curtains, turns away.
 We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic
and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA
remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the
frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel
office and joins Lila.
  MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA
 SAM
(Unconsciously
whispering)
I wonder where Norman Bates does his
hermiting?
 LILA
Someone was at that window. I saw
the curtain move.
 Sam takes Lila's arm.
 SAM
Come on.
 He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old
house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the
office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward
them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor
speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone;
containment and impassivity lie in their place.
 SAM
(Cheerfully)
Just coming up to ring for you.
 NORMAN
(Coming forward)
I suppose you want a cabin.
 SAM
We'd hoped to make it straight to
San Francisco, but we don't like the
look of that sky. Looks like a bad
day coming... doesn't it.
 Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick,
disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying,
goes onto the porch and o the office. Sam and Lila follow
Norman.
  MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
 Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to
cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have
entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.
 NORMAN
I'll take you to...
 SAM
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
 Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.
 NORMAN
It isn't necessary.
 SAM
(errupting with a
friendly cheerfulness)
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this
trip... ninety percent business...
and he wants practically notarized
receipts. I better sign in and get a
receipt.
 Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call
him "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings
out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the
book as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson." The
signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the
notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations
above Sam's.
 When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman.
Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.
 NORMAN
I'll get your bags.
 SAM
Haven't any.
 NORMAN
(after a stare)
I'll show you the cabin.
 As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns,
looks at him.
 SAM
First time I've seen it happen.
(to Lila)
Check in any place in this country
without bags, and you have to pay in
advance.
 Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his
pocket.
 NORMAN
Ten dollars...
 Norman returns to Sam, takes the ended bill, is about to
start out again.
 SAM
That receipt...?
 Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to
cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under
counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks
up the key, quickly, starts out.
 LILA
I'll start ahead.
 Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.
  THE MOTEL - (DAY)
 Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries
the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam
and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down
the porch.
 SAM
(To Norman, who is
following)
Don't bother yourself... we'll find
it.
 He goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one,
walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches
cabin twelve. CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by
the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert
and no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have
closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.
CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in
through the driver's window, twists the registration card
around, reads it.
 It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.
 Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward
cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are
confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his
face. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the
path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes
in.
  CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)
 Lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining
for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from
the window of this cabin.
 She turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot
of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased
in a sadness.
 LILA
We should have asked for Cabin One...
The one Mary was in.
 SAM
I'm glad we didn't.
 He pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits
wearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment,
feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge,
turns again and looks at Sam's back.
 LILA
We have to go o that cabin and
search it, Sam... no matter what
we're afraid of finding and no matter
how much it may hurt.
 SAM
I know.
(A pause)
Do you think if something happened,
it happened there?
 LILA
(A pause, then:)
Sam, if you owned a useless business
like this motel... one you probably
couldn't even sell... what would
you need to get away, to start a new
business, somewhere else?
(As Sam studies her)
Forty thousand dollars?
 SAM
How could we prove...
(An almost hopeless
laugh)
Well, if he opens a new motel on the
new highway... say, a year from now...
 LILA
There must be some proof that exists
right now! Something that proves he
got that money away from Mary...
Some way!
 SAM
What makes you sound so certain?
 LILA
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or
felt sorry for me... and he was
starting to feel the same about you.
I heard it when he called... in his
voice, a caring. He wouldn't have
gone anywhere or done anything without
telling us. Unless he was stopped.
And he was stopped, so he must have
found out something!
 Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.
 SAM
We'll start with Cabin One.
 He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then,
back to Lila:
 SAM
If he sees us... we're just taking
the air.
 Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out.
  THE MOTEL - (DAY)
 Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand.
 Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin
One. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin
One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on
to the office, opens the door, calls in:
 SAM
Bates?
 He waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment
comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.
 She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started
to enter.
  CABIN ONE - (DAY)
 The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.
 Sam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.
 For a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to
tell them some satisfactory story.
 Neither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search,
going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the
closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners,
not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to
find some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The
windowless room is very dark. She switches on the light,
goes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow
her in when he notices which room it is and automatically
catches himself up, backs out.
 SAM
Sorry.
 LILA
Hospital clean.
 SAM
What?
 LILA
The bathroom. Look at how clean it
is. The one in our cabin is clean...
but this is clean!
 Sam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the
medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny
tabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the
tub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more
erested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence
he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower
curtain rod.
 And realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about
to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of
shot, errupts.
 Sam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above
the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip
of her right index finger.
 SAM
What is it?
 LILA
It didn't get washed down. It's
figuring... the kind you tear up and
get rid of.
(ending her finger
toward Sam)
Some figure has been added to or
subtracted from... forty thousand.
 Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it,
takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's
license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet
away.
 LILA
That's proof Mary was here! It would
be too wild a coincidence for somebody
else to...
 SAM
(Reminding)
Bates never denied Mary was here.
 LILA
(Reminded)
Yes.
(A thought)
But maybe this proves that Bates
found out about the money.
 SAM
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden
it?
 LILA
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is.
I think she told Arbogast something!
And I want her to tell us the same
thing!
 She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm,
stops her.
 SAM
You can't go up there.
 LILA
Why not?
 SAM
Bates.
 CAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them, moves slowly over the
room, very slowly.
 LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
Let's find him. One of us can keep
him occupied while the other gets to
the woman.
 SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
You won't be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held. And I
don't like you going o that house
alone, Lila.
 CAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and
is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall
paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.
 LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
I can handle a sick old woman.
 Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is
the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch
Mary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now.
 SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
All right. I'll find Bates and keep
him occupied.
 The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before
the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung
paing.
 FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM
 They are about to start out. Sam stops her again.
 SAM
Wait a minute. If you get anything
out of the mother...
(A thought)
Can you find your way back to town?
(As Lila nods yes)
If you do get anything, don't stop
to tell me.
 Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first,
opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough
for Lila and Himself to pass through.
  THE MOTEL - (DAY)
 ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her
left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at
the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes
the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside
the open door.
 NORMAN
Looking for me?
 SAM
(Recovering)
Yes, matter of fact.
(The friendly grin)
The wife's taking a nap and... I can
never keep quiet enough for her...
so I thought I'd look you up and...
talk.
 NORMAN
Satisfied with your cabin?
 SAM
Fine.
 Sam starts o the office. Just before going in, he glances
down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of
cabin twelve, waves her a tiny "all clear" signal.
 LILA
 CAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her po of view.
 She watches Sam disappear o the office, waits until she
hears the door close, then looks about for another way to
reach the house. She sees the small alley at the end of this
L of cabins, starts toward it.
  REAR OF MOTEL - S.C.U. LILA - (DAY)
 Behind the motel Lila hesitates. She looks ahead.
 LONG SHOT - (DAY)
 The old house standing against the sky.
 CLOSE UP - (DAY)
 Lila moves forward.
 LONG SHOT - (DAY)
 The CAMERA approaching the house.
 CLOSE UP - (DAY)
 Lila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor. She moves
on.
 LONG SHOT - (DAY)
 The house coming nearer.
 CLOSE UP - (DAY)
 Lila looks up at the house. She moves forward purposefully.
 S.L.S. - (DAY)
 The house and the porch.
 CLOSE UP - (DAY)
 Lila stops at the house and looks up. She glances back.
 She turns to the house again.
 S.L.S. - (DAY)
 The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch.
 C.U. - (DAY)
 Lila puts out her hand.
 S.C.U. - (DAY)
 Lila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway.
 Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA.
  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet,
listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which
leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and
the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the
kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent.
She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares
at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor.
She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor
and dining room.
  THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
 Norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who
is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of
one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a
protective wall against the threatening world across it.
 SAM
(Cheerfully, as if
after a self-conscious
pause)
I've been doing all the talking so
far, haven't I?
 NORMAN
Yes.
 SAM
I always thought it was the people
who are alone so much who do all the
talking when they get the chance.
Yet there you are, doing all the
listening!
(A pause)
You are alone here, aren't you?
(As Norman does not
reply)
It would drive me crazy.
 NORMAN
That would be a rather reme
reaction, wouldn't it?
 SAM
(Lightly)
Just an expression...
(More seriously)
What I meant was... I'd do just about
anything... to get away. Wouldn't
you?
  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled
by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She
steps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING
UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The
door on her right, which opens o the mother's room, is
closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly
before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment,
trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on
the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door,
the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.
  THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR
 We hear Lila's second knock, then, faly, her soft call.
 LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
Mrs. Bates?
 There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open,
and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at
the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her
expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go
away from this room forever.
 After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind
her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as
Lila sees it.
 It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe,
an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of
the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the
dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a
great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-
length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite
the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the
window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled
with ashes.
 And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if
even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long
vacated by some musty presence.
 Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over
it, but it is not neat, there is the impr of a body on
it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-
like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes
to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and
jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an
opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of
hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of
herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to
the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high
wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it,
hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed
dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters
and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-
type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.
Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished
shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once
again over the whole room, starts out,
  THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind
her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to
the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark,
the shades drawn full.
 Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall,
throws on a switch.
  MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
 Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.
 SAM
I'm not saying you shouldn't be
contented here, I'm just doubting
that you are. I think if you saw a
chance to get out from under...
you'd unload this place...
 NORMAN
(Angrily)
This place! This isn't 'a place.'
It's my only world. I grew up in
that house back there. I was a happy
child. My mother and I... we were
more than happy.
 SAM
And now that your mother's dead?
 Norman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him.
 NORMAN
My mother is not dead!
 SAM
(Softly)
I didn't think so.
  NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick
dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy
of childhood held beyond the po of decency.
 It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping
silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and
fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far
too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled
covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.
N to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top
there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an
ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's
shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.
 Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled
with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white
chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record
on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be
Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.
 Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances
at the bookcase, comes o the room, goes to the bookcase
and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens
it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust.
She slams the book closed, drops it.
  THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
 Norman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall.
Sam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning
forward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.
 Norman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark,
high sheen of a cornered animal.
 SAM
(Pressing)
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?
 NORMAN
I don't know what you've been saying.
 SAM
I've been talking about your mother...
about your motel. How are you going
to do it?
 NORMAN
Do what?
 SAM
Buy a new one! In a new town!
Where you won't have to hide your
mother!
 NORMAN
Shut up!
 SAM
Where will you get the money to do
that, Bates... or do you already
have it... socked away... a lot of
it...
 NORMAN
Leave me alone!
 SAM
...Forty thousand dollars!
 NORMAN
Leave me alone!
 He is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back
o his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter,
follows.
  NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)
 Norman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached
by this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear
window, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.
Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away
as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief
flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to
gaze at Norman, hard.
 SAM
I bet your mother knows where the
money is. And what you did to get
it. And I think she'll tell us.
 Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives
Norman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances
out the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and
there is terror in his voice.
 NORMAN
Where's that girl? The girl you came
with! Where is she?
 Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine
a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.
 NORMAN
(A horrible groan)
Oh, God!
  UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out
of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in
the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite
the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the
bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.
  NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)
 Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A
candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking
as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's
footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse
of him going out o the office, almost at a run.
  STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.
 She is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound
she might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down
the stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the
front door, sees out through the door window:
 LILA'S VIEWPO - (DAY)
 Norman coming.
  STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps,
cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the
stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The
SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard.
Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the
basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching
there.
 Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens.
He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He
seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes
from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time
state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.
 Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to
the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed
by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an
upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs
for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the
steps, is about to turn o the hallway when her eye is
caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses,
looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the
not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving
SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.
 Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while
she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check
that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she
desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what
happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down
the stairs.
  THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
 Lila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards
creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She
turns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman
is sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair,
and the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh,
frightened whisper.
 LILA
Mrs. Bates...?
 Lila goes o the room.
  THE FRUIT CELLAR
 Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the
figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise
movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a
woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the
mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.
The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose
has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are
sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and
flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed
dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.
 The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning
as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually
graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.
 Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins
to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.
 And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more
dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind
her.
 NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(screaming)
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma
Bates!
 Lila turns.
 NORMAN
 His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a
woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is
similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand
is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long
breadknife in it.
 LILA
 Close on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.
 BACK TO NORMAN
 As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in
from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes
through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling
back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman,
football tackle style.
 SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT
 Norman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face,
the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified,
fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.
 MRS. BATES
 A close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying
the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the
screams of Norman.
 DISSOLVE TO:
  COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)
 There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious
and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of
newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit
truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and
chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the
sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being
moved o the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and
the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back.
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden
light thrown on a fearful darkness.
 CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE
 A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men,
muttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION
MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and
CAMERA FOLLOWS him o the courthouse vestibule.
 Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters,
Television Men. The Television Men we have been following
stops beside a Policeman.
 TELEVISION MAN
(Indicating the front
door he has just
come in through)
You think they'll take him out that
way?
 POLICEMAN
(Looking at waiting
crowd, shrugging)
Probably have to.
(A rueful smile)
Besides, the taxpayers hate it when
something gets slipped out the back
door on them!
 Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement
of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door
of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow
with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-
for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY
pauses a moment, then goes o the room.

  OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)
 Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart
from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with
the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT
ATTORNEY.
 The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes
a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila,
checking the notation on the lid as he goes.
 MED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA
 SAM
(quietly)
It's regular. Okay?
 LILA
(ruefully)
I could stand something regular.
 Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff
Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has
brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.
 For a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam
disheveled, but contained.
 CHAMBERS
You two can go on home if you like.
(a sympathetic look
at Lila)
Making that statement was enough for
one night.
 SAM
(to Lila)
Want to?
 LILA
No. I'm all right. I'll feel better
when all this is explained... if it
can be.
 Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs
doubtfully.
 CHAMBERS
If anybody gets any answers, it'll
be the fellow talking to him now...
the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't
reach Norman... and he knows me.
(to Lila)
You warm enough, Miss?
 Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come o the
room and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn,
follow her gaze.
  OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT
 A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come o
the room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.
 He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has
been placed, takes up a container.
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Did he talk to you?
 SIMON
No. I got the whole story... but not
from Norman. I got it from... his
mother.
 Everyone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes
lid from coffee container.
 SIMON
Norman Bates no longer exists. He
only half-existed to begin with...
now, the other half has taken over.
Probably for all time.
 LILA
(With difficulty)
Did he kill my sister?
 SIMON
Yes... and no.
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Look, if you're trying to lay a lot
of psychiatric groundwork for some
sort of plea this fellow would like
to cop...
 SIMON
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the
groundwork .. he merely tries to
explain it.
 LILA
But my sister is...
 SIMON
Yes. I'm sorry.
(to Chambers)
The Private Investigator, too. If
you drag that swamp somewhere in the
vicinity of the motel...
(To the Chief of Police)
Have you any unsolved missing persons
cases on your books?
 CHIEF OF POLICE
Yes. Two.
 SIMON
Young girls?
 CHIEF OF POLICE
(nods, astounded,
then:)
Did he confess to...
 SIMON
(errupting)
As I said, the mother...
(Pauses, goes on afresh)
To understand it, as I understood it
hearing it from the mother... That
is, from the mother-half of Norman's
mind, you have to go back ten years...
to the time when Norman murdered his
mother and her lover.
(A pause, then as no
one errupts)
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.
His mother was a clinging, demanding
woman... and for years the two of
them lived as if there was no one
else in the world. Then she met a
man and it seemed to Norman she "threw
him over" for this man. That pushed
him over the thin line... and he
killed them both. Matricide is
probably the most unbearable crime
of all... and most unbearable to the
son who commit it. So he had to erase
the crime, at least in his own mind.
(A pause)
He stole her corpse... and a weighted
coffin was buried. He hid the body
in the fruit cellar, even "treated"
it to keep it as well as it would
keep. And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.
So he began to think and speak for
her, gave her half his life, so to
speak. At times he could be both
personalities, carry on
conversations... at other times, the
mother-half took over completely. He
was never all Norman, but he was
often only mother. And because he
was so pathologically jealous of
her, he assumed she was as jealous
of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman, the
mother side of him would go wild.
(To Lila)
When Norman met your sister, he was
touched by her... and aroused by
her. He wanted her. And this set off
his "jealous mother" and... "mother
killed the girl." After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep
sleep... and like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime
he was convinced his mother had
committed.
 SAM
Why was he... dressed like that?
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
He's a transvestite!
 SIMON
Not exactly. A man who dresses in
woman's clothing in order to achieve
a sexual change... or satisfaction...
is a transvestite. But in Norman's
case, he was simply doing everything
possible to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive. And
whenever reality came too close,
when danger or desire threatened
that illusion, he'd dress up, even
to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd
walk about the house, sit in her
chair, speak in her voice... He tried
to be his mother.
(A sad smile)
And now he is.
(A pause)
That's what I meant when I said I
got the story from the mother. She
thinks Norman has been taken away...
because of his crimes. She insists
she did nothing, that Norman committed
all the murders just to keep her
from being discovered. She even smiled
a bit coquettishly as she said that.
Of course, she feels badly about
it... but also somewhat relieved to
be, as she put it, free of Norman,
at last.
(A pause)
When the mind houses two
personalities, there is always a
battle. In Norman's case, the battle
is over... and the dominant

(To Simon)
And the forty thousand dollars? Who
got that?
 SIMON
The swamp. These were murders of
passion, not profit.
 A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-
whisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a
folded blanket over his arm.
 POLICE GUARD
He feels a little chill... can I
bring him this blanket?
 The Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA
FOLLOWS him out of the room and out o the hallway. Guard
moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.
  ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE
 A narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of
shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered
glass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking
reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance
o the room.
 The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this
corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed

   NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)
 The walls are white and plain. There is no window.
 There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which
Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality
of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.
 The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding
it. His face, although without makeup and without the
surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity
about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch
womanliness about the brows.
 Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if
it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so
that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in
position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the
voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.

It's sad... when a mother has to
speak the words that condemn her own
son... but I couldn't allow them to
believe that I would commit murder.

They'll put him away now... as I
should have... years ago. He was
always... bad. And in the end, he
ended to tell them I killed those
girls... and that man. As if I could
do anything except just sit and
stare... like one of his stuffed
birds.
(A pause)
Well, they know I can't even move a
finger. And I won't. I'll just sit
here and be quiet. Just in case they
do... suspect me.

about Norman's face.

They're probably watching me. Well,
let them. Let them see what kind of

lights on Norman's
hand)
I'm not going to swat that fly. I
hope they are watching. They'll see...
they'll see... and they'll know...
and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't

Sir:
Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:
In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.
This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.
The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.
In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:
a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.
b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.
I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.
Yours very truly,
Albert Einstein
EXT.  VIETNAM - DUSK
A swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and
deposits an army of men over a Vietnamese hillside.
The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the
protection of the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands
of soldier ants, seventy-five men, at combat readiness,
assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness.
It is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one
platoon huddle close to the ground smoking a joint.
		JERRY
Strong stuff.
		ROD
	(to JACOB, a soldier
	squatting several yards
	away)
Hey, Professor, how many times can
you shit in an hour?
		GEORGE
Don't bug 'im.
		DOUG
Where are those gooks already?
		FRANK
Some offensive. I don't even think
they're out there.
		PAUL
Jesus, this grass is something else.
JACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants.
		ROD
Why even bother to pull 'em up?
		FRANK
You jackin' off out there again, huh
Jake?
		PAUL
Hey, get off his back.
		ROD
It's called philosophizing, right
Professor?
JACOB gives them the finger.
		JACOB
Up yours, you adolescent scum.
Laughter.
		SERGEANT (V.O.)
Mount your bayonets.
		FRANK
	(frightened)
Oh shit!
		PAUL
Goddam!
		ROD
Gimme that joint!
		JERRY
Hey, something's wrong.
		GEORGE
What is it?
		JERRY
My head.
		GEORGE
It's nerves. Take another toke.
GEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and
falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The
others stand back, startled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a
rifle barrel between his chattering teeth.
		ROD
What's going on?
Before anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He
turns frantically in all directions.
		JERRY
Help me! Help me!
		PAUL
What the hell ... ?
In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head
shaking into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the
force of a truck. FRANK slams into the ground as all the air
rushes from his lungs. He begins gasping and
hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as he
gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The
MEN watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond
reason into all-out panic.
Suddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet
and, without warning, attacks the MEN around him.
		PAUL
God Almighty!
PAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the
ground. JACOB jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into
the tall grass. PAUL rushes to his assistance.
JACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him.
It is the face of a madman.
		PAUL
Good God! What's happening?
The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting
erupting behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light
penetrate the darkening sky.
		ROD
Behind you! Look out! This is it!
The MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet,
leaving JACOB alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with
demonic force as he gathers his strength.
		JACOB
Don't leave me.
Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming
at them. SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.
		PAUL
They're coming!
Gunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He
begins screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and
skin. FRANK is struggling like four men and JACOB is
weakening in his effort to restrain him. Bayonets glimmer in
the exchange of fire. Bodies fall. More bodies keep coming.
The first wave is upon them.
ROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward
screaming like banshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his
bayonet, piercing the belly of his attacker. Agonizing cries
accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet out and stabs
again.
In the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and
slams the butt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a
cracking sound. JACOB's eyes freeze with pain. His hands
rush for his spine. As he spins around one of the ATTACKERS
jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into JACOB's
stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.
CUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a
long dark tunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed
accelerating toward a brilliant light. The rush suggests a
passage between life and death, but as the light bursts upon
us we realize that we are passing through a SUBWAY STATION
far below the city of NEW YORK.
INT.  SUBWAY - NIGHT
THE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station.
JACOB SINGER, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. The
sounds of the scream and the grating wheels merge. He is
dazed and confused, not certain where he is.
JACOB glances around the empty car. His eyes gravitate to
overhead advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and
savings banks. Gradually his confusion subsides. Shifting
uncomfortably he pulls a thick book out of his back pocket,
"The Stranger" by Albert Camus. He begins reading. Another
station blurs by.
JACOB is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence. He is
in his mid-thirties. It is surprising that he is wearing a
mailman's uniform. He doesn't look like one.
The subway ride seems to go on interminably. JACOB is
restless and concerned. He glances at his watch. It is 3:30
A.M. Putting his book in his back pocket, JACOB stands up
and makes his way through the deserted car.
INT.  SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT
JACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. The
wheels spark against the rails. The dark tunnel walls flash
by. He pulls the handle on the door to the next car. It is
stuck. He struggles with it. A LADY sitting alone inside
turns to look at him. She seems threatened by his effort. He
motions for her to help. She turns away.
A look of disgust crosses JACOB's face. He kicks the door.
It slides open. The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches
her.
		JACOB
Excuse me, do you know if we've
passed Nostrand Avenue yet?
	(she doesn't answer)
Excuse me.
	(she does not
	acknowledge his
	existence)
Look, I'm asking a simple question.
Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell
asleep.
		WOMAN
	(speaking with a Puerto
	Rican accent)
I no from around here.
		JACOB
	(glad for a response)
Yeah, you and everyone else.
JACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down. The
only other passenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the
fiberglass bench. Occasionally his body shudders. It is the
only sign of life in him.
The train begins to slow down. JACOB peers out of the
window. Nostrand Avenue signs appear. He is relieved. He
gets up and grabs hold of the overhead bar.
The OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat. As he
adjusts his position, tugging at his coat, JACOB catches a
brief glimpse of something protruding from beneath the
coat's hem. His eyes fixate on the spot, waiting for another
look. There is a slight movement and it appears - a long,
red, fleshy protuberance. The sight of it sends shivers up
JACOB's spine. It looks strangely like a tail. Only the
stopping of the train breaks JACOB's stare.
INT.  SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
JACOB is the only passenger getting off. The doors close
quickly behind him. He glances at the LADY sitting by the
window. There is a fearful expression on her face as the
train carries her back into the dark tunnel, out of his
sight.
JACOB reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door
surrounded by floor to ceiling gates. He is about to push
when he notices a chain locking it shut. He stares at it in
disbelief.
		JACOB
Goddam it.
He turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the
platform. As he approaches the far exit, his eyes widen. The
gate there is also locked. His hands reach for his hips as
he studies an impossible situation.
CUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down
to the tracks. A rat scampers by and he gasps.
		JACOB
No way!
He starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is
nowhere else to go. He juts out his jaw and steps back down.
JACOB is not comfortable on the tracks. He cannot see where
he is stepping. His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which
makes him grimace. The steel girders are coated in subway
grime. The oily substance coats his hands as he reaches for
support.
		JACOB
Goddam fucking city!
He wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward
the center track. He reaches for another girder when it
begins to vibrate. Two pinpoints of light hurl toward him.
Then the noise arrives confirming his fear. A train is
bearing down on him. JACOB looks frightened, not sure which
way to go. He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. He
cannot tell which track the train is on. It is moving at
phenomenal speed. The station is spinning. The train's
lights merge into one brilliant intensity.
In near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train
spins by. Its velocity blows his hair straight up as though
it is standing on end. He clings to a pillar for support,
gasping in short breaths.
A few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train. Their
faces, pressed up against the glass, seem deformed. A lone
figure waves at him from the rear window. The train bears
them all away. Then it is quiet again. For a moment JACOB is
afraid to move but slowly regains his composure. He
continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up
the ladder to the UPTOWN PLATFORM.
							CUT TO:
JACOB smiling. The smile, however, is one of irony, not
amusement. This exit too is locked. A heavy chain is wrapped
through the bars. JACOB stares at it with an expression of
total bewilderment.
A sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone.
His head turns but sees no one. He hears the scream again.
He senses its direction and walks toward the MEN'S ROOM. A
crack of light appears under the door. He can hear someone
moaning inside. JACOB knocks softly and the moaning stops.
The lights click off.
		JACOB
Hey, is someone in there?
There is no answer. JACOB stands silently for a moment, not
sure what to do. He can hear whispering. He chews his lower
lip nervously and then reaches for the door. It pushes open.
The light from the station penetrates the darkness. He
gasps. He sees a MAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER
NAKED MAN grabbing quickly for his clothes. The BOUND MAN
screams.
		BOUND MAN
Fuck off! Mind your own business!
A THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at
JACOB's throat.
		MAN
You cocksucker! Get outta here.
The MAN's face is barely human. Before JACOB can even react
the door slams shut. The lock engages. The crack of light
reappears. JACOB can hear laughter coming from inside,
followed by a scream. He backs away from the door. His face
is white.
JACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate. The chain
gives wayto his anger. It flies apart and the gate flings
open. He stands in amazement, observing the chain as it
slides from between the bars and drops to the concrete
below. The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes it aside and
clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.
EXT.  WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN
JACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC
HOUSING PROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes
the huge monolithic structures. JACOB passes through a vast
COURTYARD dominated by the imposing shapes. Aside from his
moving body everything is still.
INT.  HALLWAY - DAWN
JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long
impersonal hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to
his APARTMENT.
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN
JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He
tries to navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a
tiny nightlight in the distance. His effort is unsuccessful.
He bangs loudly into a table. A WOMAN"s voice calls out.
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
Jake, is that you?
		JACOB
What the hell did you do, move all
the furniture?
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
Why didn't you turn on the light?
		JACOB
I didn't want to wake you.
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
	(sleepy but pleasant)
Gee, thanks a lot.
		JACOB
Where is the lamp?
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
Where are you?
		JACOB
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask.
What did you do? I was happy the way
it was.
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
I moved the couch. That's all.
		JACOB
Where to?
JACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL
"JEZZIE" PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a
man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy,
disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that
JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual.
		JEZZIE
That help?
		JACOB
	(nearly sprawled over
	the couch)
Thanks.
He pushes himself up.
		JEZZIE
What do you think?
		JACOB
What do you mean?
		JEZZIE
The room!
		JACOB
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
		JEZZIE
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come
you're so late?
		JACOB
Roberts didn't show up. What could I
say? Besides, it's double time.
		JEZZIE
	(seeing the grease on
	his uniform)
What happened to you?
		JACOB
	(unbuttoning his shirt
	as he walks to the
	BATHROOM)
Don't ask.
JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes,
leaving them in a pile on the floor. He reaches for the
faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the
porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's nakedness. She reaches
out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. His body
tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter the
shower together.
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water.
JACOB is crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese
JUNGLE. His shirt is bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping
on his right forearm. His left arm is holding his intestines
from spilling onto the grass.
		JACOB
Help me. Someone.
Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It
dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It
is impossible to see who is carrying it. The light darts
near the ground where JACOB is lying and then bursts
directly into his eyes.
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY
SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping
fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand
rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is
done. He is awake.
JACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand
gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for
his glasses. He has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps
blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends
it crashing to the floor. He sits up with a disgusted look
on his face and searches the out-of-focus shelf behind him.
Suddenly JEZZIE enters.
		JEZZIE
You up?
		JACOB
No. Have you seen my glasses?
		JEZZIE
	(shaking her head)
Where'd you leave 'em?
		JACOB
I don't know.
		JEZZIE
Did you look around the headboard?
		JACOB
	(wearily)
Jezzie, I can't see.
		JEZZIE
	(she scans the shelf)
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a
large paper bag. She tosses them both onto the bed.
		JACOB
Thanks.
	(he puts on his glasses
	and notices the bag)
What's that?
		JEZZIE
Your kid dropped it off.
		JACOB
Who? Jed?
		JEZZIE
	(stooping to pick up the
	phone)
No. The little one.
		JACOB
Eli. Why can't you remember their
names?
		JEZZIE
They're weird names.
		JACOB
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
		JEZZIE
Well, personally, I never went for
church names.
		JACOB
And where do you think Jezebel comes
from?
		JEZZIE
I don't let anybody call me that.
		JACOB
	(shaking his head)
You're a real heathen, you know that,
Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get
involved with such a ninny?
		JEZZIE
You sold your soul, remember? That's
what you told me.
		JACOB
Yeah, but for what?
		JEZZIE
A good lay.
		JACOB
And look what I got.
		JEZZIE
The best.
		JACOB
I must have been out of my head.
		JEZZIE
Jake, you are never out of your head!
		JACOB
	(ignoring the criticism
	and reaching for the
	paper bag)
What's in here?
		JEZZIE
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss
'em so "what's his name" brought 'em
over on his way to school.
JACOB lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed.
There are hundreds of them. He examines them with growing
delight.
		JACOB
Look at these, will ya? I don't
believe it. Jesus, these are
fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ...
And here's my brother, when we were
down in Florida.
		JEZZIE
Lemme see.
		JACOB
	(rummaging excitedly
	through the pile)
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when
I was still at City College.
		JEZZIE
	(looking closely)
That's Sarah?
	(she studies the photo)
I can see what you mean.
		JACOB
What?
		JEZZIE
Why you left.
		JACOB
What do you mean you can see?
		JEZZIE
Look at her face. A real bitch.
		JACOB
She looked good then.
		JEZZIE
Not to me.
		JACOB
Well, you didn't marry her.
He digs through more photos. Suddenly he stops.
		JEZZIE
What's wrong?
To JEZZIE's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes.
For a moment JACOB is unable to speak. He just stares at one
of the photos. JEZZIE looks at the picture. It is an image
of JACOB carrying a small child on his shoulders.
		JEZZIE
Is that the one who died?
		JACOB
	(nodding)
Gabe.
JEZZIE is silent. JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Sorry. it just took me by surprise. I
didn't expect to see him this morning
... God, what I wouldn't ... He was
the cutest little guy. Like an angel,
you know. He had this smile ...
	(choking up again)
Fuck, I don't even remember this
picture.
Hiding his emotions, JACOB scrambles over the bed and
reaches for a pair of pants. He pulls out his wallet and
then carefully puts the photo of GABE inside. It joins
photos of his two other boys. JEZZIE begins shoving the
remaining pictures back into the paper bag.
		JACOB
Wait. Don't.
		JEZZIE
I don't like things that make you
cry.
		JACOB
I just want to look ...
He reaches into the pile for other snapshots. We see an
array of frozen moments, happy, unfocused, obscure. Suddenly
he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot.
		JACOB
God, this is me!
	(he holds up a baby
	photo)
Look. It's dated right after I was
born.
	(he stares at it
	intently)
What a kid. Cute, huh? So much
promise.
JEZZIE surveys the scene.
		JEZZIE
It's amazing, huh Jake? Your whole
life ... right in front of you.
	(she pauses before
	making her final
	pronouncement)
What a mess!
INT.  HALLWAY - DAY
JEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the
hall. She is carrying several bags. Two of them are tossed
instantly down the chute. She hesitates with the third.
After a moment she reaches into it and pulls out a handful
of photos. They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH. With cool
deliberation she drops them down the chute. An apartment
door slams shut. Quickly she disposes of the pictures
remaining in her hand. JACOB opens the door to the tiny room
as the bag filled with the memories of his life falls to the
fire below.
		JACOB
Ready?
		JEZZIE
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
JACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the
ELEVATOR. They are surprised that it has arrived promptly.
JEZZIE reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into
JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the ELEVATOR. They disappear,
laughing, behind its closing doors.
EXT.  NEW YORK CITY - DAY
JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of
midtown Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a
rendition of Al Jolson's "Sonny Boy."
JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th
Street. He opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes
toward him. He lifts them with effort and slams the door
with his foot. It doesn't close. He considers giving it
another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns instead and
waddles toward the store.
INT.  LAUNDRY - DAY
A heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a
counter cluttered with laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon
is still stapled to the wall. She looks at JACOB.
		WOMAN
Where do you expect me to put those?
I don't have any room.
She tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help.
		WOMAN
	(continuing)
How 'bout over there?
	(she points to a table)
No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to
the back room.
		JACOB
They're awfully heavy.
		WOMAN
I know. That's why I'm asking.
JACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store.
CHINESE LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam
from the pressing machines shoots into the air.
		JACOB
	(huffing and puffing)
Where's Wong?
		WOMAN
That's what I'd like to know. If you
see him on the street somewhere, tell
him he's fired.
JACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a
snapping sound and he winces in pain. Massaging his back,
JACOB unfolds some papers for the WOMAN's signature.
		JACOB
How was Palm Springs?
		WOMAN
Hot. Where do I sign?
		JACOB
	(pointing to the line)
You got a nice tan, though.
		WOMAN
Tan? What tan? It faded on the
airplane. I'd try to get my money
back, but who do you ask?
	(she looks heavenward)
Two hundred dollars a night, for
what?
She hands JACOB the wrong sheet.
		JACOB
No. I'll take the other one.
	(he takes it)
Right. Well it's good to have you
back. See you tomorrow, probably.
		WOMAN
If you're lucky.
JACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks
carefully. His back is out.
INT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY
ANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving.
Horns are blaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches
for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags. To his shock
one of the bags appears to move. Curious, JACOB pokes at it.
Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and
stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps back,
stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is
looking at an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck.
The man's face is covered in strange bumps.
		JACOB
Goddamn it! What the hell ... ?
		WINO
	(pleading)
I didn't take nothin'. I was just
napping. Don't hit me. I was cold.
		JACOB
	(lifting the man up)
What the hell do you think you're
doing? You can't do this. This is
government property.
He begins opening the door. The WINO begs.
		WINO
Don't throw me out. They're gonna get
me. They'll tear me to pieces.
He holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away.
		JACOB
Come on. You can't stay here.
		WINO
Please! I never hurt anybody when I
was alive. Believe me. I don't belong
here.
JACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him
from the truck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars
and follow him as he leads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB
pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the
WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a ball and turns
away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB returns to
the truck shaking his head.
		JACOB
New York!
He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view
mirror. He notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side
of a building. A horn honks and traffic begins moving. When
JACOB looks back the WINO is no longer there.
INT.  GARAGE - DAY
JACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE
PARKING GARAGE on 34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He
has difficulty parking.
INT.  POST OFFICE - DAY
We see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting
and moving mail.
JACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks
stiffly through the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back.
Several workers greet him and grab for his french fries. He
offers them around.
ANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in,
correcting mistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE
looks up and smiles.
		JEZZIE
Jake!
		JACOB
How's it going?
She takes the hamburger and shrugs.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
I'm going home.
		JEZZIE
What's wrong?
		JACOB
I don't know. One of these days, I'm
gonna see Louis. My back's killing
me.
		JEZZIE
Now? What about the boss? He's not
gonna like it.
JACOB shrugs.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Well, I'll miss riding home with you.
I was looking forward to it.
		JACOB
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
		JEZZIE
I enjoy crushing into you.
She grabs him and hugs him tightly.
		JACOB
Gently. My back.
JEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again.
INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
CUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTOR'S OFFICE. He is
lying on a long leather padded device that looks like an
instrument of torture. LOUIS, the Chiropractor, is a giant
of a man, 280 pounds. He is adjusting JACOB's spine.
		LOUIS
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
		JACOB
How do you know?
		LOUIS
I know you. How come you're so tense
today?
		JACOB
What can I tell you?
		LOUIS
I saw Sarah the other day.
		JACOB
Her knee acting up?
		LOUIS
A bit.
		JACOB
What did she have to say?
		LOUIS
Turn on your right side.
	(he turns on his left)
How about the other "right?"
	(JACOB turns back)
I don't understand you philosphers.
You've got the whole world figured
out but you can't remember the
difference between right and left.
		JACOB
I was absent the day they taught that
in school. What did she say?
		LOUIS
Who?
		JACOB
Sarah.
		LOUIS
Not much. She's like you that way.
Two clams. No wonder your marriage
didn't last. Put your hand under your
head. Take a breath and then let it
out.
He makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOB's thigh.
JACOB groans.
		LOUIS
	(continuing)
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
		JACOB
She talk about the boys?
		LOUIS
She says she can't get them new coats
because you haven't sent the alimony
for three months.
		JACOB
She told you that?
	(he shakes his head)
Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm
still paying for the orthodontist?
I'll bet she didn't mention that.
		LOUIS
She said you were a son of a bitch
and she regrets the day she set eyes
on you.
		JACOB
I thought you said she didn't say
much.
		LOUIS
She didn't. That's about all she
said. Put your hand up. Good. I think
she still loves you. Take a breath
and let it out.
He makes an adjustment. JACOB screams.
		JACOB
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind
word about me in years!
		LOUIS
Right. She doesn't stop talking about
you. You're always on her mind.
That's love, Jake.
		JACOB
She hates me, Louis.
		LOUIS
You should go back to her.
		JACOB
What? She threw me out, remember. She
wanted some professor to carry her
far away from Brooklyn. Only we
didn't make it. She can't forgive me
that she still lives in the same
house she grew up in.
		LOUIS
Her problem is that you spent eight
years getting a PhD and then went to
work for the post office.
		JACOB
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam
I didn't want to think anymore. I
decided my brain was too small an
organ to comprehend this chaos.
		LOUIS
	(looking at JACOB with
	affection)
If it was any other brain but yours,
I might agree. Relax, this is going
to be strong.
		JACOB
I can't relax.
		LOUIS
Wiggle your toes.
JACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists
JACOB's neck rapidly. There is a loud cracking sound.
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera
yelling.
		MAN
I found one. He's alive.
He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and
halos.
CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
Suddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind
his head.
		JACOB
God almighty. What did you do to me?
		LOUIS
I had to get in there. A deep
adjustment. Rest a moment and let it
set a bit.
		JACOB
I had this weird flash just then.
		LOUIS
What?
		JACOB
I don't know. I've been having them
recently.
	(he thinks a moment,
	then changes the
	subject)
You know, you look like an angel,
Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone
ever tell you that?
		LOUIS
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No
more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back
won't take it. You tell your girl
friend to calm down if she knows
what's good for you.
		JACOB
Louis, you're a life saver.
		LOUIS
I know.
EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to
himself and imitating Al Jolson.
		JACOB
When there are gray skies, I don't
mind the gray skies, as long as
there's you ...
He hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The
shop windows have a particularly garish look about them. The
mannequins are dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry,
clothes and have a pathetic appearance. A few shops have set
up their Christmas decorations.
The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost
blasphemous.
JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a
local drug store. They chortle and make taunting sounds.
		GIRL
	(shaking her tits,
	singing)
"Hey, Mr. Postman ... "
JACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins
to sing with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is
a sweet moment.
JACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The
light is green. He is still singing to himself and does not
notice a BLACK CAR sharging around the corner. The car is
moving at full speed, heading straight toward him. A YOUNG
MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.
		YOUNG MAN
Look out!
JACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but
it swerves in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.
		YOUNG MAN
Jump!
With a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the
car shoots by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back
seat. They are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads.
They do not look human. JACOB yells and waves his fist, to
no effect. After a moment he turns to thank the YOUNG MAN
whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK
JACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple
and even in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their
positioning is erotic and stimulating. Both of them are
nude. JACOB's hands are clasped behind his neck and he is
staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is lying on her
side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head is
propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the
bayonet scar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking.
Suddenly, out of the blue, JEZZIE speaks.
		JEZZIE
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake.
The money. Things like that. Or your
wife.
		JACOB
Why do you bring her up?
		JEZZIE
'Cause she's always on your mind.
		JACOB
When was the last time I said a word?
		JEZZIE
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
She pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the
conversation is over. Then she continues.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Or maybe it's the war.
JACOB closes his eyes.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
It's still there, Jake.
	(she points to his
	brain)
Even if you never say a word about
it. You can't spend two years in
Vietnam ...
		JACOB
	(annoyed)
What does that have to do with
anything? Does it explain the
barricaded subway stations? Does it
explain those Godforsaken creatures?
		JEZZIE
New York is filled with creatures.
Everywhere. And lots of stations are
closed.
		JACOB
They're like demons, Jez.
		JEZZIE
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos
and bag ladies. Low life. That's all
they are. The streets are crawling
with 'em. Don't make em into
somethin' they're not.
	(she rubs his forehead)
It's the pressure, honey. That's all
it is.
		JACOB
Those guys tried to kill me tonight.
They were aiming right at me.
		JEZZIE
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the
time.
		JACOB
They weren't human!
		JEZZIE
Come on. What were they, Jake?
JACOB doesn't answer. He turns over on his stomach. JEZZIE
stares at his naked back and drags her fingernails down to
his buttocks. Scratch marks follow in their wake.
		JEZZIE
You still love me?
He does not respond.
INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY
JACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table. JEZZIE
is reading the National Enquirer and chewing at her lip.
Suddenly a drop of blood forms and falls onto the formica
table top. Staring at it for a moment, she wipes it with her
finger and then licks it with her tongue.
JACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window
at the housing project across the way. The toaster pops.
JEZZIE jumps. She gets up, butters her toast, and returns to
her paper.
		JEZZIE
Says here the world's comin' to an
end. The battle of heaven and hell
they call it. Should be quite a show;
fireworks, H-bombs, and everything.
You believe them, Jake?
JACOB doesn't answer.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Me neither ... God, look at this. Two
heads. Only lived two days. A day for
each head. Could you imagine me with
two heads? We'd probably keep each
other up all night - arguing and
whatnot. You wanna see the picture?
He does not respond. JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB.
Standing in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets
it fall apart. She is naked underneath it. Sensuously she
leans forward, unbuttons his shirt, and strokes his chest.
She waits for a response from him, but there is none. He
sits silently, disinterested.
Furious, JEZZIE turns away. Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from
the broom closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches
it on. Breasts flash from beneath her gown as the vacuum
roars back and forth across the floor.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My
uncle's dogs used to treat me better
than you do. At least they'd lick my
toes once in a while. At least they
showed some fucking interest.
A NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall, shouting.
		JEZZIE
All right! All right! All right!
JACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and
watches the patterns of early morning movement. Tiny figures
drift purposefully over the concrete.
Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. In the silence, JACOB
realizes that JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled
over the kitchen table. He walks to her side and strokes her
hair. JEZZIE begins to sob. After a moment she looks at him
with puffy eyes.
		JEZZIE
You love me?
He nods his head "yes." She smiles coyly and rubs her hair
like a kitten against his crotch. After a few moments she
speaks.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Della's party's tonight. Why don't we
go? It'll take your minf offa things.
And I won't make you dance. I
promise. Huh?
	(he nods his head in
	consent. JEZZIE hugs
	him)
You still love me, Jake?
He nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question
exhausts him.
INT.  BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY
JACOB is in the "Mental Health Clinic" at BELLVUE HOSPITAL
walking through the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. It is
overflowing with people. Some are handcuffed to their
chairs. POLICEMEN are with them. JACOB approaches the main
RECEPTION DESK. He speaks nervously.
		JACOB
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson,
please.
		RECEPTIONIST
Carlson? Is he new here?
		JACOB
New? He's been here for years.
She shrugs and looks at a log book.
		RECEPTIONIST
Not according to my charts. Do you
have an appointment?
		JACOB
	(shaking his head)
Look, I need to see him. I know where
his room is. Just give me a pass. I
won't be long. Ten minutes.
		RECEPTIONIST
Our doctors are seen by appointment
only.
		JACOB
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out-
patient program. He knows me.
		RECEPTIONIST
	(not happy)
What's your name?
		JACOB
Jacob Singer.
She walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several
times before coming back over to JACOB.
		RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry but there's no record of a
Jacob Singer in our files.
		JACOB
Whataya mean, no record?
		RECEPTIONIST
You want me to spell it out? There's
nothing here.
		JACOB
That's ridiculous. I've been coming
here for years. Listen to me. I'm
going out of my fucking mind here. I
need to see him.
		RECEPTIONIST
If this is an emergency we have a
staff of psychiatric social workers.
There's about an hour's wait. I'll be
glad to take your name. Why don't you
just fill out this form?
		JACOB
Goddamn it! I don't want a social
worker. Carlson knows me.
JACOB pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and
knocking the RECEPTIONIST's forms to the floor. She grunts
angrily and stoops to retrieve them. Standing up her cap
hits a drawer handle and slips off. TWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS
protrude from her skull where the cap had been. JACOB's eyes
lock on them like radar. He backs away. She immediately
replaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at
him with demonic intensity. JACOB, freaked, angry, turns and
runs toward the "In Patient" door.
		RECEPTIONIST
Hey! You can't go in there!
JACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs
after him.
JACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging
institution. A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands,
is moving down the hall. They break ranks as he charges by
and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT tries to calm them down
but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their hysteria.
They grab hold of him as he tries to get by.
		POLICEMAN
LET GO! GET AWAY!
INT.  GROUP ROOM - DAY
JACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor,
wildly searching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes
inside. He is surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN
seated in a circle. They all look up at him.
		LEADER
Can I help you?
		JACOB
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't
this his office?
The LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he
gets up and takes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone
is watching them. The LEADER speaks quietly.
		LEADER
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't
... Dr. Carlson died.
		JACOB
	(stunned)
Died?
		LEADER
A car accident.
		JACOB
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
		LEADER
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
		JACOB
How did it happen?
		LEADER
No one knows. They say it blew up.
		JACOB
	(growing pale)
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
The LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but
he pulls away.
		LEADER
Do you want me to get someone?
		JACOB
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
He backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he
realizes that all of the PEOPLE in the group are watching
him intently.
Unsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is
frightened and confused. Suddenly a voice calls out.
		POLICEMAN
HEY YOU! MAILMAN!
JACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun
is drawn.
		POLICEMAN
Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell
do you think you are? This is
Bellevue, for God's sake. People
running around here get shot.
The GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions
to the POLICEMAN.
		LEADER
It's alright. He's okay.
		POLICEMAN
	(nodding, reholstering
	his gun)
Come on, get out of here. I wouldn't
want to interfere with the U.S. Mail.
He leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back.
INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT
WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is
with some POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a
small apartment. A DRUNK is telling a bad joke and trying to
hold a glass of wine at the same time. It is constantly on
the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on it. In the
background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to
join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if
they "get it," takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of
confusion and keeps trying to re-explain the joke.
JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be
coming from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and
lifts the cover. The BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if
trying to get out. The sound, loud and insistent, startles
him. He lowers the cover.
In the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA,
an attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees
JACOB and calls over the music.
		ELSA
Hey, you! Let me look at your hand!
JACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.
		DELLA
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a
book.
		JACOB
No, thanks.
		DELLA
It's fun.
CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the
mounds and examining the lines. What begins as a playful
expression on her face turns suddenly serious. She reaches
for his other hand and compares the two of them. JEZZIE
looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene jealously.
		ELSA
You have an unusual hand.
		JACOB
I could have told you that.
		ELSA
You see this line here? It's your
life line. Here's where you were
born. And this is where you got
married. You're a married man, huh?
Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
She studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries
to get JACOB's attention. He ignores her.
		ELSA
	(continuing)
You know, you got a strange line
here.
		JACOB
	(examining it)
It's short, huh?
		ELSA
Short? It's ended.
		JACOB
	(laughing)
Oh, terrific.
		ELSA
It's not funny. According to this ...
you're already dead.
		JACOB
	(smiling)
Just my luck.
							CUT TO:
THE DANCERS. Their movements are loose and getting looser.
The music is strong and insistent. The smokey atmosphere
disfigures the dancers and gives them a strange, distorted
appearance. Suddenly JEZZIE breaks from the crowd and
reaches for JACOB. He pulls away. Some of the MALE DANCERS
call out to him.
		DANCERS
Come on man, show your stuff.
JACOB is easily intimidated. Relenting, he glares at JEZZIE
and nods apologetically to ELSA. It is obvious that he is
embarrassed at his inadequacy on the dance floor.
		MAN
Come on professor. You got feet, too.
JACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing.
JEZZIE is playing with him, mimicking his movement. A number
of DANCERS notice and laugh, which only increases his
discomfort. JEZZIE's taunting has a strange effect on JACOB.
He grows distant and withdrawn, even though his body is
still going through the motions of the dance.
A MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder. She spins around,
smiling, and begins dancing with him. JACOB is left alone,
dancing by himself. He looks away, uncomfortable.
In the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor. She seems
to be urinating on the carpet. JACOB is shocked. Several
DANCERS obscure his view. He turns around.
A PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen. JACOB
cannot believe what he sees.
In the next room, past JEZZIE, JACOB glimpses a terrifying
image, a MAN whose head seems to be vibrating at such
enormous speed that it has lost all definition. Something
about the image compels and frightens JACOB. Slowly he
approaches it. As he draws nearer to it the tortured image
lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that
JACOB backs away.
A WOMAN, laughing, grabs JACOB, spins him around, and begins
dancing with him. He is totally disoriented.
		WOMAN
Hold me, baby!
She takes JACOB's arm and guides it to her back. THE CAMERA
follows his hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her
sexy, loose fitting dress. He runs his fingers up to her
shoulder blades. Then, suddenly, he recoils. Her back is a
mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange, bony
protrusions. JACOB gasps. Out of the blue, JEZZIE leans into
him and wiggles her tongue in his ear. JACOB, startled,
jerks his head and his glasses go flying to the floor.
		JACOB
Shit!
He stoops down blindly to pick them up. Shoes just miss his
fingers as he digs between dancing legs trying to recover
them. Miraculously, he grabs the spectacles just before they
are crushed and slips them back on. Instantly his world
comes back into focus.
As he stands, JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him,
gyrating in wild abandon. There is a huge, satisfied smile
on her face. She grabs his hand as if encouraging him to
dance but it is obvious that she is dancing to her own
rhythm. JACOB stares at her, confused. It takes him a moment
to realize that her smile is not for him.
Standing behind JEZZIE is another DANCER, his hands around
her waist. They are moving together, locked in erotic
embrace. It appears that he is mounting her from behind.
Looking down we see that the DANCER's feet are deformed.
They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much
like hooves. They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet.
Something horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIE's back.
We cannot make out what it is, but it elicits a primal
terror. Before JACOB can react, JEZZIE opens her mouth. With
a roaring sound, a spiked horn erupts from her throat. It
juts menacingly from between her teeth and thrusts into the
air. A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited approval.
CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He
stares at the DANCERS who are crowding around him. They have
become perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves.
JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision
from his head but it won't go away. The music throbs. His
actions become spastic, almost delirious.
JACOB is out of control. His frenzy becomes a kind of
exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body
and his mind. WE MOVE IN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond
pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT fade away.
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness,
outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a
cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking.
		VOICE
He's burning up.
		VOICE
Total delirium.
		VOICE
That's some gash. His guts keep
spilling out.
		VOICE
Push 'em back.
		JACOB (V.O.)
Help me!
His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it
filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings
draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into
exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash
stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost sensual,
surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.
Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and
insistent, like a heart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies
the sound. The stroboscopic flashes are replaced by intense
flashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and
reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.
INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT
The APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy. The neon sign
is still flashing outside the window. DANCERS are smiling
and sweating.
Cheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB
barely hears them. JEZZIE hugs him tightly. PEOPLE smack him
on the back.
		ADMIRER
You are out of your mind, man. Out of
your fuckin' mind.
		WOMAN
Jake, you little devil. You never
told me you could dance like that.
		MAN
Jezzie, what did you put in his
drink?
JEZZIE smiles while pulling JACOB to a corner chair. He
plops down. His chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of
his stomach. Hie face is frightened and distorted.
		JEZZIE
You okay?
		JACOB
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
		JEZZIE
Oh, come on. It's early.
		JACOB
	(pulling JEZZIE close to
	him, his voice filled
	with paranoia)
Where are we?
		JEZZIE
	(surprised by the
	question)
We're at Della's.
		JACOB
Where?
		JEZZIE
What do you mean? Where do you think?
		JACOB
Where's Della? Bring her here?
		JEZZIE
Why? What for?
		JACOB
Show me Della!
		JEZZIE
	(confused)
Hey, I'm here.
JACOB eyes her with a pleading look. Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves
JACOB and crosses the room. He watches her as she goes.
JACOB is holding his stomach and rocking painfully. Moments
later JEZZIE returns with DELLA.
		DELLA
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
		JACOB
	(staring at her closely)
Della?
		DELLA
	(feeling the
	strangeness)
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
		JACOB
I see.
		DELLA
What do you want?
		JACOB
Just to see you. That's all.
		DELLA
	(a bit uncomfortable)
Well, how do I look?
		JACOB
Like Della.
Suddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins
shaking. His entire body is convulsive.
		JEZZIE
Are you feeling all right? Shit,
you're burning up. Feel his forehead.
		DELLA
	(checking his forehead
	and cheeks)
Damn, that's hot. Maybe from dancing.
		JEZZIE
I think you should lie down.
JACOB is shaking uncontrollably. People are gathering
around.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Can't you stop it?
		JACOB
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
		WOMAN
Is he sick?
		DELLA
He's on fire.
		ELSA
Let me help you.
She reaches out to JACOB. Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping
to his feet like a wild man. He begins to scream.
		JACOB
Stay away from me! Don't you come
near me! All of you. Go to hell! Go
to hell, goddamn you! Stay away!
JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look.
A MAN whispers to her.
		MAN
I'll call a cab.
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT
JACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer
in his mouth. JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great
agitation.
		JEZZIE
I've never been so mortified in my
whole life. Never! Screaming like
that. I don't understand what's
gotten into you, Jake, to make you do
a thing like that. You're not acting
normal. I've lived with too many
crazies in my life. I don't want it
anymore. I can't handle it. I'm tired
of men flipping out on me. Shit,
you'd think it was my fault. Well you
picked me, remember that. I don't
need this.
The NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
All right! All right!
JEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
If you go crazy on me you're goin'
crazy by yourself. You understand?
JEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer.
She looks at it closely and then squints to see it better.
		JACOB
What's it say? A hundred and two?
		JEZZIE
I don't believe this. I'm calling the
doctor.
She runs out of the room. JACOB calls after her.
		JACOB
What does it say?
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
It's gone to the top.
		JACOB
How high is that?
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
The numbers stop at 107.
JEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room.
JACOB begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket
at the foot of the bed. He pulls it up around his shoulders.
The whole bed vibrates with his shivering. Suddenly JEZZIE
rushes through the BEDROOM and into the BATHROOM. SHe turns
on the bath water.
		JACOB
What the hell are you doin'?
		JEZZIE
Get your clothes off.
		JACOB
What are you talking about? I'm
freezing.
		JEZZIE
Get your clothes off!
JACOB gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the
KITCHEN.
		JACOB
What'd the doctor say?
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
That you'd die on the way to the
hospital. Now get into that tub.
JACOB stares at her as she bursts back into the BEDROOM
carrying four trays of ice cubes. She hurries into the
BATHROOM and dumps them in the tub.
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
He's coming right over.
		JACOB
Coming here?
		JEZZIE (V.O.)
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't
stand around waiting.
She rushes out of the BATHROOM and pulls JACOB out of bed.
He is shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating
across the room and undressing him at the same time. She
maneuvers him into the BATHROOM next to the tub. He looks
down at the ice cubes floating in the water.
		JACOB
You're out of your mind. I'm not
getting in there. I'd rather die.
		JEZZIE
That's your decision.
		JACOB
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
		JEZZIE
You're red hot, damn it. Get in
there. I've got to get more ice.
She runs out of the room. The door to the apartment slams
shut. JACOB sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out
again instantly.
		JACOB
Oh Jesus!
He sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice
cold water turns his foot bright red. He keeps it in as long
as he can and then yanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a
towel. JACOB rubs his foot vigorously to get rid of the
sting and stares at the water, afraid of its pain.
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT
JEZZIE is running up and down the CORRIDOR knocking on doors
and collecting ice cubes from those who will answer. She
hurries back to the BATHROOM with several PEOPLE behind her
carrying additional ice trays. One of the MEN is shifting
the trays in his hands to avoid the burning cold.
INT.  JACOB'S BATHROOM
As JEZZIE enters the BATHROOM, JACOB is sitting on the rim
of the tub with the water up to his calves, shivering
vigorously.
		JACOB
I can't do it.
		JEZZIE
What kind of man are you?
She unloads two trays into the water.
		JACOB
Don't gimme that.
		JEZZIE
Lie down!
		JACOB
	(pleading)
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
		JEZZIE
	(calling out)
Sam, Tony, come in here.
		JACOB
Hey, I'm not dressed.
		SAM
You got nothin' we ain't seen before.
SAM and TONY grab hold of JACOB who wrestles to get away.
		JACOB
Get the hell off me.
		TONY
He's like a hot coal.
		SAM
It's for your own good, Jake.
		JACOB
Let go of me, you sons of bitches.
The TWO MEN struggle with JACOB and force him into the
water. TONY winces when the water hits his arm. JACOB nearly
flies out of the tub. The TWO MEN fight to hold him down.
JACOB screams and cries for the MEN to let him go but they
keep him flat on his back.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
I'm freezing! I'm freezing! Goddamn
you!
		TONY
	(his hand turning red)
Sam, I can't take it.
		SAM
Don't you let go.
		TONY
Jez, get help. My hands are killing
me.
		JACOB
Help me! Help me!
		JEZZIE
	(to TONY)
Here. I'll do it.
		TONY
Take his legs.
		SAM
Run your hands under hot water.
MRS. CARMICHAEL comes in.
		MRS. CARMICHAEL
I have some ice from the machine.
		JEZZIE
Bring it in.
		MRS. CARMICHAEL
Is he all right?
		JEZZIE
He doesn't like it.
		MRS. CARMICHAEL
I don't blame him. What should I do
with the ice?
		JEZZIE
Pour it in.
		MRS. CARMICHAEL
On top of him?
		JEZZIE
He's melting it as fast as we dump it
in.
		MRS. CARMICHAEL
Okay. My husband's got two more bags.
He's coming. They're heavy.
TONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells.
		JACOB
Oh God! You're killing me! Stop!
INT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT
CUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He
is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to
get out. Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window.
It is open and the shade is flapping. Cold air is blowing in
and he is shivering.
		JACOB
Damn! You and your fresh air.
He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes
at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A
woman in the bed sits up. It is SARAH.
		SARAH
What was that?
		JACOB
It's freezing.
		SARAH
I'm not cold.
		JACOB
Of course not. You have all the
blankets. It must be ten degrees in
here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you
want to sleep with fresh air, you
sleep on the fire escape. From now on
that window is closed.
		SARAH
It's not healthy with it closed.
		JACOB
This is healthy? I'll probably die of
pneumonia tomorrow and this is
healthy.
He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to
his side. He lies quietly for a moment, thinking.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
What a dream I was having. I was
living with another woman ... You
know who it was?
		SARAH
I don't want to know.
		JACOB
Jezebel, from the post office. You
remember, you met her that time at
the Christmas party. I was living
with her. God, it was a nightmare.
There were all these demons and I was
on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
		SARAH
Guilty thoughts. See what happens
when you cheat on me, even in your
mind?
		JACOB
She was good in bed, though.
		SARAH
Go to sleep.
		JACOB
She had these real beefy thighs.
Delicious.
		SARAH
I thought you said it was a
nightmare?
Suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a
music box. A YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical
LUNCH BOX in his arms. He is wearing a long T-shirt nearly
down to his ankles. We recognize him from his photograph. It
is GABE.
		GABE
Daddy, what was that noise?
		JACOB
	(surprised to see him)
Gabe?
	(he stares curiously at
	his son)
What are you doing ... ?
		GABE
There was a bang.
		JACOB
It was the window.
		GABE
It's cold.
		JACOB
Tell your mother.
		GABE
Mom, it's ...
		SARAH
I heard you. Go back to sleep.
		GABE
Will you tuck me in?
		SARAH
	(not happily)
Oh ... all right.
She starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He
whisks GABE upside down and carries him into his
GABE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
BEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way.
GABE laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits
the bed. JED, 9, and ELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across
the room. JED looks up.
		JED
Dad?
		JACOB
Jed. It's the middle of the night.
	(he kisses GABE and goes
	over to JED in the lower
	bunk)
What's up?
		JED
You forgot my allowance.
		JACOB
Your allowance? It's five A.M. We'll
talk at breakfast.
		JED
Okay, but don't forget.
Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.
		ELI
I love you, Dad.
JACOB smiles.
		JACOB
What is this, a convention? I love
you, too, Pickles. Now go back to
sleep.
He turns to leave.
		GABE
Wait ... Daddy.
		JACOB
Now what?
		GABE
Don't go.
		JACOB
Don't go?
	(he smiles)
I'm not going anywhere. I'm right
here, Gabe.
	(he looks at his son
	tenderly)
Come on, go back to sleep. You can
still get a couple of hours.
He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door.
		GABE
... I love you.
There is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB
is struck by them.
		GABE
	(continuing)
Don't shut the door.
JACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar.
		GABE
	(continuing)
A bit more ... a bit more.
JACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him
secure. GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed.
INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
JACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets
comfortable. JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He
pulls the blankets up to his neck. He is overcome with
feelings of sadness and longing.
		JACOB
I love you, Sarah.
She smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds
he is back asleep.
EXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN
WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image
of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky,
just before sunrise, can be seen through the branches. It is
an idyllic setting.
Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a
metallic humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of
feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall
grass. Voices can be heard. Men's voices.
		VOICE
They're here.
		VOICE
Thank God. Move 'em out!
		VOICES
Bust your balls!
		VOICE
Move it! Move it!
There is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches
blur and speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments
before reveals itself as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out
of a JUNGLE covering and into a huge CLEARING.
High overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a
deafening whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle
in mid-air. SOLDIERS leap up into the air reaching for them.
The air is filled with turbulence. Tarps fly off dead
bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices yell but the words
are not clear. They are filled with urgency.
The CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear
as the helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows
larger and darker as the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and
insignias dotting the underbelly come into view. Suddenly
the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. Hands emerge
from inside, reaching out to grab it.
Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling
of water, a heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard
mumbling; distant sounds, warm and familiar.
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
JACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub.
Surprisingly JEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there
too. JACOB stares at them in total confusion.
		DOCTOR
You are a lucky man, my friend. A
lucky man. You must have friends in
high places, that's all I can say.
SAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending
their hands to the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue,
reach out to them.
Slowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one
step onto the tile and collapses to the floor.
						CUT TO BLACK:
INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY
FADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass
rattles on a tray. A television is on low in the background.
Slowly the CAMERA LENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see
JEZZIE puttering around the BEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware
that JACOB is watching her. She smiles.
		JEZZIE
Jake.
	(she places her hand on
	his head and strokes his
	hair)
You're gonna be all right, Jake.
You're gonna be fine.
		JACOB
Am I home?
		JEZZIE
You're here. Home. The doctor said
you're lucky your brains didn't boil.
	(she smiles)
What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You
kept sayin' "Sarah, close the
window," over and over. And talkin'
to your kids. Even the dead one.
Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds
of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
		JACOB
Are we in Brooklyn?
		JEZZIE
You're right here, Jake. You just
rest.
	(she puffs up his
	pillow)
The doctor said you had a virus.
That's what they say when they don't
know what it is. You can't do
anything for a week. He says you
gotta recuperate.
	(she strokes his
	forehead, and gets up)
Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman
made you some chicken soup. It'll
warm you up.
JEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He
seems lost and confused.
INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY
JACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the
KITCHEN TABLE. PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out
before him. He studies them to distraction. JEZZIE is
standing by the counter making sandwiches. She wraps them in
plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another in the
refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform.
		JEZZIE
You know, you really ought to get out
today. You can't just sit around like
this all the time. It's not healthy.
It's not good for your mind. Go take
a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie.
Christ, who's gonna know? You think I
care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy
yourself. One of us should be having
a good time.
	(JEZZIE knocks on
	JACOB's head)
Hello! Anybody home?
	(she looks in his ear)
Anybody in there?
		JACOB
What?
JEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB
returns to his books.
CUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with
spindly horns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger,
magnified, scans page after page of ancient images and
archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of attention,
returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around.
		JEZZIE
Goddamn it! I can't stand it anymore.
I've had it up to here. Go ahead and
rot if you want ... You son-of-a-
bitch, I'm talking to you.
CUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches
JACOB's attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He
looks up to see JEZZIE knocking pots and pans off the
kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room. The
noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is shocking.
The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books
onto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops.
JEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich,
stuffs it back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in
her lunch box. She is about to leave when she stops and
looks at JACOB.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing, her anger
	in check)
I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's
in the fridge. Eat a carrot with it.
The aspirin's on the bottom shelf.
We're out of soap so, if for some
reason you decide to wash yourself
again, use the dishwashing stuff.
	(she walks out of the
	room and returns with
	her coat)
I'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my
nerves.
	(she bends down and
	makes eye contact with
	JACOB)
Hello? Listen, I gotta go.
JEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then,
unexpectedly, raises two fingers, like horns, over her head.
The gesture catches JACOB's full attention.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.
	(she kisses his cheek)
Love me a little?
		JACOB
	(speaking with
	affection)
You are the most unbelievable woman I
have ever met. One second you're a
screaming banshee and the next you're
Florence Nightingale. Who are you?
That's what I want to know. Will the
real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles them.
		JEZZIE
Oh shit. Tell 'em I've left.
JEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside
down. A pocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB
smiles. JEZZIE curses as she struggles to pick it up and get
the jacket on right. JACOB gets the phone.
		JACOB
Hello.
		PAUL (V.O.)
Jacob Singer?
		JACOB
Speaking.
		PAUL (V.O.)
Paul Gruneger!
		JACOB
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be
goddamned!
JACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss
goodbye and hurries out the door.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the
hell are you? I haven't seen you in
what, five, six, years?
		PAUL (V.O.)
A long time.
		JACOB
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's
happening in your life?
		PAUL (V.O.)
Nothin' much.
		JACOB
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So
tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
		PAUL (V.O.)
I need to see you, Jake.
		JACOB
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But
I'm kind of laid up here. I've been
sick.
		PAUL (V.O.)
I need to see you.
INT.  PAUL'S CAR - DAY
JACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading
toward WILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them.
JACOB pats PAUL on the back.
		JACOB
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You
must have put on twenty pounds.
		PAUL
I work in a bakery.
		JACOB
You're lucky. How many vets you know
are even employed?
		PAUL
Count 'em on one hand.
		JACOB
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
		PAUL
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn
war. I'm still fightin' it.
		JACOB
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
		PAUL
You tellin' me? How many times can
you die, huh?
PAUL looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes. He
sees a black car tagging close behind him. He pulls out. So
does the car.
		PAUL
	(continuing)
Still married, Jake?
		JACOB
Nope.
		PAUL
You and everybody else. God I hate
this area. Makes me nervous.
		JACOB
Why the hell we drivin' here?
		PAUL
I just need to talk.
		JACOB
You can't talk in Brownsville?
		PAUL
I'm not sure where I can talk
anymore.
		JACOB
What's wrong?
		PAUL
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?
	(he looks at his rear
	view mirror)
Hey, take a look behind us. Do you
think that car is followin' us?
		JACOB
	(turning to look)
That black car?
		PAUL
Pull the mirror down on the sun
visor.
	(JACOB does)
Just watch 'em.
		JACOB
What's goin' on Paul?
		PAUL
I don't know.
		JACOB
You in trouble?
		PAUL
Yeah.
JACOB notices PAUL's left arm. It is shaking. The black car
passes on the left. Both PAUL and JACOB stare at it as it
speeds by.
INT.  BAR - DAY
JACOB and PAUL are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure
WILLIAMSBURG BAR. It is nearly empty. PAUL is leaning across
the table in a very intimate fashion.
		PAUL
Somethin's wrong, Jake. I don't know
what it is but I can't talk to
anybody about it. I figured I could
with you. You always used to listen,
you know?
JACOB nods. PAUL takes a sip of his drink and stares
deliberately into JACOB's eyes.
		PAUL
	(continuing)
I'm going to Hell!
JACOB's face grows suddenly tense.
		PAUL
	(continuing)
That's as straight as I can put it.
And don't tell me that I'm crazy
'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to
Hell. They're comin' after me.
		JACOB
	(frightened, but holding
	back)
Who is?
		PAUL
They've been followin' me. They're
comin' outta the walls. I don't trust
anyone. I'm not even sure I trust
you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm
gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
PAUL cannot contain his fear. He jumps up suddenly and walks
away from the booth. JACOB follows him with his eyes but
does not go after him. A YOUNG MAN in the next booth
observes the scene with interest. He looks vaguely familiar,
like we have seen him before.
PAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over
to the juke box. He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and
drops it in the slot. His finger pushes a selection at
random. Some '60's rock hit blares out. JACOB's mind is
reeling by the time PAUL sits back down.
		PAUL
	(continuing)
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just
gonna jump outta my skin. They're
just drivin' me wild.
		JACOB
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
		PAUL
I don't know who they are, or what
they are. But they're gonna get me
and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I
can't do anything. I can't go to my
sisters. I can't even go home.
		JACOB
Why not?
		PAUL
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
PAUL's hand starts to shake. The tremor spreads rapidly to
his whole body. The booth begins to rattle.
		PAUL
	(continuing)
I can't stop it. I try. Oh God! Help
me Jake.
JACOB slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves
in toward PAUL. He puts his arm around him and holds him
tightly, offering comfort as best he can.
PAUL is obviously terrified and grateful for JACOB's
gesture. A few PEOPLE at the bar look over in their
direction.
		JACOB
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
		PAUL
	(crying)
I don't know what to do.
		JACOB
Don't do anything.
	(PAUL begins to relax a
	bit and the shaking
	subsides)
Paul, I know what you're talking
about.
		PAUL
What do you mean?
		JACOB
I've seen them too ... the demons!
		PAUL
	(staring at JACOB)
You've seen them?
		JACOB
Everywhere, like a plague.
		PAUL
God almighty. I thought I was the
only one.
		JACOB
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I
was coming apart at the seams.
		PAUL
Oh God. I know. I know.
		JACOB
What is it Paul? What's happening to
me?
		PAUL
They keep telling me I'm already
dead, that they're gonna tear me
apart, piece by piece, and throw me
into the fire.
	(he fumbles in his coat
	pocket and pulls out a
	small Bible and silver
	cross)
I carry these everywhere but they
don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone
thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a
report with the army.
		JACOB
	(stunned)
The army?
		PAUL
She said I haven't been the same
since then. Since that night. There's
still this big hole in my brain. It's
so dark in there, Jake. And these
creatures. It's like they're crawling
out of my brain. What happened that
night? Why won't they tell us?
		JACOB
I don't know. I don't know.
		PAUL
They're monsters, Jake. We're both
seein' 'em. There's gotta be a
connection. Something.
JACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG
MAN in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention.
INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY
PAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the
urinal.
		PAUL
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I
keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come
up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a
guy can't even take a leak by
himself. I've seen 'em take people
right off the street. I used to go
home a different way every night. Now
I can't even go home.
		JACOB
You come home with me.
		PAUL
What about your girlfriend? You don't
think she'll mind?
		JACOB
Are you kidding? We've put up more of
her cousins. You wouldn't believe how
they breed down there.
PAUL smiles.
EXT.  BAR - DAY
The TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold
outside. Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the
bar's front window. PAUL looks at them and smiles.
		PAUL
Merry Christmas.
PAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of
his car. He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB
looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime.
		JACOB
Goddamn, this is my lucky day.
He bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the
ignition and steps on the gas. He turns the key.
THE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the
air. JACOB sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris
hurls above him. He covers his head.
EXT.  VIETNAM
CUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is
exploding all around it and the shock waves are rocking the
craft violently. JACOB's eyes peer to the left.
INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A
pair of MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of
arterial bleeding sends a stream of blood splattering over
the inside of the windshield. The PILOT, unable to see,
clears it away with his hands.
JACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the
MEDICS presses his ear close to JACOB to hear.
		JACOB
Help me!
		MEDIC
We're doing the best we can.
		JACOB
Get me out of here!
EXT.  BAR - DAY
THE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and
drags him down the sidewalk.
		YOUNG MAN
Just hold on.
		JACOB
Where am I? Who are you?
The YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another
explosion consumes the car. The air is filled with flames
and flying debris. The YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.
		YOUNG MAN
Just lie still. You're okay. You're
not hurt.
The CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has
blown apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross
from around PAUL's neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are
heard in the distance. A BLACK CAR speeds off down the
street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had helped him. He
is gone.
EXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY
A FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.
INT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY
JACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are
dressed up. JACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad
over his ear. They drive in silence. JACOB appears very sad.
Slowly his right hand reaches across the seat, seeking
JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace.
EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
The FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along
the length of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from
their cars along with WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.
They are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the
film, only they are older now. A small group of FAMILY
MEMBERS are helped to the graveside.
JACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry
the casket in semi-military formation to the grave.
INT.  PAUL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
JACOB'S OLD ARMY BUDDIES are sitting together in Paul's
living room, talking. PAUL'S WIFE can be seen in the
BEDROOM. Several WOMEN are comforting her.
JEZZIE is talking to a small group of LADIES in the DINING
ROOM and nibbling off a tray of cold cuts. PAUL'S SISTER is
with her and they seem to be having a lively, almost
intimate, conversation.
JACOB and his BUDDIES are drinking beer. They all have a
tired, defeated look about them.
		FRANK
Did anyone see the police report? It
sounds like a detonation job to me.
		JERRY
The paper said it was electrical; a
freak accident.
		ROD
Bullshit. Someone's covering
somethin'. That was no accident.
		GEORGE
Why do you say that?
		ROD
Cars don't explode that way. Any
simpleton knows that.
		GEORGE
But the paper ...
		ROD
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
		DOUG
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an
enemy in the world.
		JERRY
How do you know?
		DOUG
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd
want to hurt him?
		FRANK
What did he talk about when you guys
went out? Did he say anything?
		JACOB
He was upset. He thought people were
following him.
		JERRY
You're kidding. Who?
		JACOB
He didn't know ... Demons.
		GEORGE
	(obviously struck by the
	word)
What do you mean, demons?
		JACOB
He told me he was going to Hell.
The statement has a surprising impact on the group. There is
immediate silence and eyes averted from one another.
		ROD
What'd he say that for? What made him
say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
		GEORGE
What else did he say, Jake?
		JACOB
He was scared. He saw these creatures
coming out of the woodwork. They were
tryin' to get him, he said.
		GEORGE
	(his arm shaking)
How long had that been going on?
		JACOB
A couple of weeks, I think.
He notices GEORGE's beer can rattling.
		GEORGE
He say what they looked like?
		JACOB
No. Not really ...
		GEORGE
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right
back.
		ROD
In one end, out the other, huh
George?
GEORGE tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom. His arm
is nearly out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet
as he walks.
		ROD
	(continuing)
Still a spastic, huh? I hope you can
hold your dick better than you hold
that can.
No one laughs. There is an uncomfortable silence.
EXT.  A BACK ALLEY - DAY
The SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It
is already gray and getting darker.
		DOUG
I know what Paul was talking about. I
don't know how to say this ... but in
a way it's a relief knowing that
someone else saw them, too.
		ROD
You're seeing ... ?
		DOUG
They're not human, I'll tell you
that. A car tried to run over me the
other day. It was aiming straight for
me. I saw their faces. They weren't
from Brooklyn.
		ROD
What are you tellin' me? They're from
the Bronx?
		DOUG
It was no joke, Rod.
		JERRY
Something weird is going on here.
What is it about us? Even in Nam it
was always weird. Are we all crazy or
something?
		DOUG
Yeah, ever since that ...
He hesitates. They all understand.
		ROD
What's that have to do with anything?
		FRANK
It was bad grass. That's all it was.
		JERRY
Grass never did that to me.
		DOUG
You know, I've been to three shrinks
and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates
that night. Nothing.
		ROD
It's not worth goin' over again and
again. Whatever happened, happened.
It's over.
		JACOB
... I've seen them, too.
		ROD
Shit!
		JERRY
So have I.
		JACOB
Look, there's something fucking
strange going on here. You know
Paul's not the only one who's died.
You remember Dr. Carlson over at
Bellevue? His car blew up, too.
		ROD
Dr. Carlson's dead?
		JACOB
An explosion, just like Paul's.
		JERRY
No!
		FRANK
Jesus!
		GEORGE
You think they're connected?
		JACOB
	(he nods)
I think something's fucking connect-
ed. I mean, a car tried to run me
over the other day. Doug too, right?
We've got six guys here going fucking
crazy.
		ROD
Not me, buddy.
		JACOB
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us
are flipping out for some goddamn
reason. They're tryin' to kill us.
Fuck it man, we need to find out
what's going on.
		DOUG
Do you think it has something to do
with ... the offensive?
		JACOB
It's got something to do with some-
thing. I think we've got to confront
the army. If they're hiding shit from
us, we better find out what it is.
		ROD
Come on, Professor. The army's not
gonna give you any answers. You'll be
buttin' your head against a stone
wall.
		JACOB
Maybe that's the only way to get
through. Besides, six heads'll be
better than one.
		ROD
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm
gettin' a headache just listenin' to
you.
		JACOB
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
		ROD
I say you should get a shrink.
		DOUG
Too late. I've tried. I think you're
right, Jake. I'm game.
		JERRY
Me, too.
		ROD
You guys are fucking paranoid. It was
bad grass. That's all it was. There's
no such thing as demons.
INT.  LAW OFFICE - DAY
JACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on
plush chairs in the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a
red-faced man with three chins, is sucking on an ice cube.
He looks at each of the men, and then spits the ice cube
into an empty glass. It clinks.
		GEARY
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you
have any idea how many people come to
me with the injustices of the world?
It'd break your heart.
		JACOB
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The
army did something to us and we've
got to find out what.
		GEARY
The army. The army. What is it with
you guys? We're not talking about a
trip to the library here. This is the
United States Government for God's
sake. This is red tape coming out of
your ass. You know what I mean?
		JACOB
Exactly. And we need someone to cut
through it. We hear you're the man.
		GEARY
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason
here?
GEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file
drawer. He chomps down a few and offers the bag to the
others. There are no takers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube
and cracks it between his teeth.
		GEARY
	(continuing)
Okay. I'll look into it.
The MEN are surprised and excited.
		PAUL
Wow! Do you think we have a chance?
		GEARY
What do you want, a fortune teller or
a lawyer? ... I'll need sworn
depositions from each of you and a
list of the other members of the
platoon, or their survivors.
		DOUG
Hey, this is great.
		GEARY
I'll tell you, if we find the
military is implicated in any way,
you could stand to recover quite a
lot of money. Not that I can predict
anything, but some class action suits
of this kind have been awarded fairly
generous judgements. That wouldn't be
so bad, would it Mr. Singer?
		JACOB
Doctor.
	(GEARY looks at him
	oddly)
Ph.D.
		GEARY
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
		JACOB
I am.
		GEARY
	(confused)
Then why aren't you teaching? Why
aren't you in a university?
		JACOB
I'm too messed up to teach.
		GEARY
	(smiling)
Ah! Well then, they're going to have
to pay for that, aren't they?
The MEN all nod in agreement.
EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
JACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are
jubilant, clasping hands and smacking each other on the
back. We watch as they break up. JACOB heads for the subway.
FRANK and another group hop a cab. As the cab pulls away we
notice that a black car pulls out behind it. It follows them
out of sight.
INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
JACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on
the kitchen floor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand
splashes into the dog's bowl. Nothing impedes their passion.
JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and swoons. Hands grab hold of table
legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly against the stove. It
is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends.
JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply
basks in JEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and
radiant. They lie exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum
floor.
		JEZZIE
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
		JACOB
	(smiling broadly)
With wings. You transport me, you
know that? You carry me away.
JEZZIE kisses him softly around his face and gently probes
his ear with her pinky. JACOB loves it.
		JEZZIE
We're all angels, you know ...
	(she bites his earlobe.
	He winces)
... and devils. It's just what you
choose to see.
		JACOB
I love you, Jez.
		JEZZIE
I know.
		JACOB
Underneath all the bullshit, just
love.
		JEZZIE
Remember that.
		JACOB
You know what? I feel ... exorcised
... like the demons are gone.
		JEZZIE
How come? The army?
		JACOB
In a way. At least now I have some
idea of what was happening. If we can
only get them to admit ... to explain
what they did ... I don't know. Maybe
it'd clear things up in my head. I'll
tell you something, Jez, honestly
... I thought they were real.
Silence. Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares
JACOB half to death. They laugh and tumble back to the
floor.
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - EVENING
JACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe.
JEZZIE is moving rapidly around the KITCHEN.
		JEZZIE
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a
Manhandler. It'll be ready at a
quarter of. I threw a little salad
together. It's in the fridge. I also
bought some apple juice, Red Cheek.
Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake,
your lawyer called.
		JACOB
He did? When?
		JEZZIE
	(grabbing her coat)
While you were in the shower.
		JACOB
Why didn't you call me?
		JEZZIE
He didn't give me a chance.
	(she pauses nervously)
Look, honey, don't get upset, but
he's not taking your case.
		JACOB
	(stunned)
What? What do you mean?
		JEZZIE
He said you didn't have one.
		JACOB
What's he talking about?
		JEZZIE
I don't know. That's all he said. He
wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He
said your buddies backed down. They
chickened out, he said.
		JACOB
I don't believe this.
		JEZZIE
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd
stay and talk but I'm so late. Look,
don't be upset. We'll talk when I get
home. See you around midnight.
	(she kisses him on the
	cheek)
Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or
something.
JACOB'S APT./FRANK'S APT. - INTERCUT
The door slams securely. The locks set. JACOB begins
instantly rifling through a desk drawer. He comes up with a
frayed address book and looks up a number. He dials.
		FRANK (V.O.)
Hello.
		JACOB
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
We see FRANK standing at a window fingering the Venetian
blinds. He does not reply. The scene intercuts between the
two men.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Listen, I just got a strange call
from Geary. He said the guys backed
down. What's he talking about?
		FRANK
	(fingering the Venetian
	blinds)
That's right. We did.
		JACOB
What does that mean, Frank? I don't
get it. Why?
		FRANK
It's hard to explain.
		JACOB
	(angry)
Well, try, huh.
		FRANK
I don't know if I can. It's just that
war is war. Things happen.
		JACOB
Things happen? What the fuck are you
talking about? They did something to
us, Frank. We have to expose this.
		FRANK
There's nothing to expose.
		JACOB
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to
you?
	(silence)
What's going on? How can you just
turn away?
	(no response)
What about the others?
		FRANK
They're not interested, Jake.
		JACOB
Shit! You know it's not half the case
if I go it alone. We're all suffering
the same symptoms, Frank. The army is
to blame. They've done something to
us. How can you not want to know?
		FRANK
	(pausing)
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
		JACOB
What do you mean?
		FRANK
Maybe there's a larger truth.
		JACOB
What are you talking about?
		FRANK
Maybe the demons are real.
		JACOB
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is
that?
		FRANK
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
		JACOB
What the hell? What kind of mumbo
jumbo ... ?
		FRANK
I'm hanging up.
		JACOB
Hey, wait!
		FRANK
Don't bother to call again, okay?
FRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long
time, until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds
him it's off the hook. The sound frightens him and he slams
the receiver down. QUickly JACOB tears through his address
book looking for other phone numbers. They aren't there.
		JACOB
Shit!
INT.  JACOB'S APT.
JACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box
from the closet. The box is filled with yellowing army
papers, dog tags, and photos of old comrades. Beneath his
discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names
and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs it. Then his
eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks
it up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written
in a child's handwriting. "DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE
COME HOME. JED GOT A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO
SEND HER MONEY. LOVE, GABE."
							CUT TO:
EXT.  BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY
GABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is
running alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic
streamers trail from the handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly,
but determined. After a couple of false starts, JACOB lets
go and GABE is riding by himself. For an instant, GABE looks
back at his father with a huge grin on his face. JACOB is
grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away
from us and heads into the distance.
								CUT BACK TO:
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT
JACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter.
Suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full
length mirror mounted on the bedroom door. Something in the
mirror, like the image of a child, seems to move. He looks
over. There is nothing there. Curious, JACOB walks toward
the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops moving.
To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected
in the mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him.
He lifts his hand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened
but defiant, JACOB moves toward the mirror. The image in the
mirror spins around. It is the  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE
he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An unearthly scream comes
from both their mouths.
		JACOB
NO!!!
INT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
A huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it.
He is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded
court house corridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is
cradling a Coke in one hand, a sandwich and a briefcase in
the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he walks.
		JACOB
Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it!
You can't just walk away from this.
GEARY keeps walking. JACOB catches up to him.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Who's been talking to you? The army?
Have they been talking to you, huh?
		GEARY
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You
don't have a case, you hear me? It's
pure and simple. Now leave me alone.
Okay?
JACOB grabs the back of GEARY's jacket and pulls him up
short.
		GEARY
	(continuing)
Take your hands off me!
JACOB lets go. He stares into GEARY's eyes.
		JACOB
Listen, will you listen? They're
trying to get me. They're comin' out
of the walls. The army's done
something to me. I need you.
		GEARY
You need ... a doctor.
		JACOB
A doctor? And what's he gonna do,
tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked
with my head. I've got to prove it.
You've got to do something.
GEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look.
		GEARY
There's nothing I can do.
He turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and
then rushes after him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich.
Mayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his
tongue. JACOB catches up to him.
		GEARY
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
		JACOB
Something's going on here. You're not
telling me something. What the hell's
gotten into you?
		GEARY
I'll tell you what's gotten into me.
I don't know you from Adam, right?
You come to my office with this
bizarro story and demand I look into
it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and
I did. Now I don't know what kind of
fool you take me for, but you have
used and abused me, and I don't like
it.
		JACOB
Used you?
		GEARY
I talked to the Army's Bureau of
Records. You've never even been to
Viet Nam.
		JACOB
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?
		GEARY
It means that you and your buddies
are whacko, that you were discharged
on psychological grounds after some
war games in Thailand.
		JACOB
	(stunned)
War games? Thailand? That's not true!
How can you believe that? Can't you
see what they're doing? It's all a
lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's
sake. You've got to believe me.
		GEARY
I don't have to do any such thing.
I'm eating my lunch, okay?
GEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away.
JACOB, enraged, charges after him. With a wild swipe he
sends the COKE CAN shooting out of GEARY's hand. It
reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.
		JACOB
You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece
of shit!
With a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's
other hand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in
it. Tomato and mayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB
turns away.
CUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the
elevators. There is a look of satisfaction on his face.
CUT BACK TO GEARY. He picks up a telephone and dials.
Someone comes on the line. GEARY speaks quietly.
		GEARY
He's on his way.
CUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close.
The Muzak is playing "Sonny Boy" with Al Jolson singing.
JACOB is surprised to hear it. He presses the down button
for the main floor.
The elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly.
SEVERAL SOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB.
		SOLDIER 1
Let's go, Singer.
JACOB is shocked to see them. He tries to get away but two
of the SOLDIERS yank him toward the LOBBY doors.
		SOLDIER 2
You're coming with us.
INT.  CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
JACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in
between two officious looking MEN. The doors lock from the
DRIVER's command.
		ARMY OFFICIAL #1
Mr. Singer. What an appropriate name
for a man who can't keep his mouth
shut.
The car drives off.
		JACOB
Who are you? What do you want?
		ARMY OFFICIAL #2
We've been watching you for a long
time. You and your friends. You've
been exhibiting some very odd
behavior. Frightening people with
foolish talk about demons - and
experiments.
JACOB tries to speak but the other MAN grabs his mouth.
		ARMY OFFICIAL #1
You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.
Men drown that way. The army was
another part of your life. Forget it.
It is dead and buried. Let it lie.
		ARMY OFFICIAL #2
I hope we have made our point, Mr.
Singer.
JACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally
berserk. Letting out a howl, he begins pounding and
thrashing like a madman. He is totally out of control.
With a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door
flies open. It flaps back and forth, slamming into parked
cars. JACOB tries to jump out, but the men yank him back in.
One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB sees it and goes crazy.
His feet kick in all directions, slamming the DRIVER's nose
into the steering wheel and shattering the side window.
The car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to
the floor. The men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat.
In the mayhem, JACOB throws himself out of the flapping door
and sprawls onto the pavement. People look down at him as
the car speeds away.
EXT.  BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON
JACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries
to get up, but can't move. He reaches out to people passing
by, but they ignore him and hurry past.
A SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene.
After a moment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles
over to JACOB. He leans down and steals his wallet.
		SANTA
Merry Christmas.
EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
CUT TO THE SOUND OF A SIREN as an AMBULANCE races through
the streets.
INT.  HOSPITAL - EVENING
AN AMBULANCE CREW rushes JACOB to a HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.
		BEARER
He's been screaming like a madman.
You better get something in him.
		RESIDENT
	(approaching JACOB)
Hi. I'm Doctor Stewart. Can you tell
me what happened?
		JACOB
My back. I can't move. I need my
chiropractor.
		RESIDENT
Your back? Did you fall?
		BEARER
They said he slipped on the ice. May
have hit his head.
		ATTENDANT
Does he have any identification?
		BEARER
No waller. Nothing.
		JACOB
They stole it.
		RESIDENT
Who did?
		JACOB
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my
son's picture in it. Gabe's picture.
It's the only one I had.
		RESIDENT
We better get an orthopedic man in
here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
		NURSE
I'll page him.
		JACOB
Call my chiropractor.
		NURSE
We're doing everything we can.
		JACOB
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
		RESIDENT
I'm going to have to move you a bit,
just to check for injuries. This may
hurt a little.
		JACOB
No. Don't move me.
The RESIDENT ignores him. JACOB screams.
		RESIDENT
I don't have to ask if you can feel
that.
		JACOB
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
		NURSE
Who's Louis?
		RESIDENT
He's out of it. I'm taking him down
to X-ray.
An ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding
doors. JACOB tries to get up but the pain keeps him
immobilized.
INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT
JACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless
series of corridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a
hypnotic regularity. The smooth tile floor gives way to
roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet plod through pools of blood
that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way. The
surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body parts
and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves
faster.
		JACOB
Where are you taking me? Where am I?
		ORDERLY
You know where you are.
JACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He
glances to the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led
into dark rooms. No one fights or struggles. We hear muffled
screams from behind closed doors. Occasionally he glances
inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange
contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from
metal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a
baseboard heater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned.
A door opens. A bicycle with plastic streamers on the
handlebars lies crushed and mangled. One of its wheels is
still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is not his voice we
hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His whole body
stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head
vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has
seen before. JACOB screams.
INT.  ROOM - NIGHT
JACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of "DOCTORS" are
waiting. As they draw closer JACOB notices that something
about them is not right. They bear a subtle resemblance to
Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of another world. JACOB tries
to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot move. He tries to
scream but no sound comes out.
Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered
and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and
legs. He screams.
		JACOB
Oh God!
The "DOCTORS" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door
closing. JACOB is left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new
group of "DOCTORS" emerges from the shadows. They are
carrying sharp surgical instruments. They surround JACOB,
their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB is
panting and sweating in fear. One of the "DOCTORS" leans
over JACOB. He gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE.
		JACOB
JEZZIE!
She pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA
TILTING DOWN HER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a
decaying mass, swarming with maggots. The "DOCTORS" laugh.
They take great pleasure in his suffering. Their voices are
strange and not human. Each utterance contains a multitude
of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting
and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a
torment of its own.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Get me out of here.
		"DOCTOR"
Where do you want to go?
		JACOB
Take me home.
		"DOCTOR"
Home?
	(they all laugh)
This is your home. You're dead.
		JACOB
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm
not dead.
		"DOCTOR"
What are you then?
		JACOB
I'm alive.
		"DOCTOR"
Then what are you doing here?
		JACOB
I don't know. I don't know.
	(he struggles like an
	animal)
This isn't happening.
		"DOCTOR"
What isn't happening?
		JACOB
Let me out of here!
		"DOCTOR"
There is no out of here. You've been
killed. Don't you remember?
A "DOCTOR" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with
horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a
long needle from his belt and positions it over JACOB's
head. Like a divining rod it locates a particular point near
the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the "DOCTOR"
shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly
into his brain. JACOB howls.
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
CUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the
opening sequence of the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are
charging over rice paddies in the dark of the night. ONE OF
THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long bayonet blade and
jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out.
INT.  ROOM - NIGHT
CUT BACK TO THE "DOCTORS".
		"DOCTOR"
Remember?
		JACOB
No! That was years ago! I've lived
years since then.
		"DOCTOR"
It's all been a dream.
		JACOB
No! The army did this to me! They've
done something to my brain.
	(he raves like a madman)
Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm
not dead! I want my family!
The "DOCTORS" laugh and back away, disappearing into the
darkness.
INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead. NORMAL
HOSPITAL WALLS materialize instantaneously around him. A
NURSE enters the room followed by SARAH, ELI, and JED. They
approach JACOB who is lying in traction, suspended over a
hospital bed.
		NURSE
He's still pretty doped up. I don't
think he'll be able to talk yet and I
doubt that he'll recognize you.
		SARAH
I just want to see him.
		JED
	(eating a Snickers bar)
Dad. Hi. It's us. We just found out.
		ELI
You look terrible. Does that hurt?
		NURSE
I'll be outside if you need me.
		SARAH
Jake. It's me. We heard what
happened.
		JACOB
	(his voice hoarse,
	nearly whispering)
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
		SARAH
No. Of course you're not. You've just
hurt your back. That's all. You're
going to be fine. It'll just take
some time.
		JED
A month, they said.
		ELI
	(trying to joke)
You just hang in there, Dad.
		SARAH
	(smacking him)
That's not funny.
	(she reaches over and
	rubs JACOB's brow)
What a mess, huh? God I wish there
was something I could do. I love you,
Jacob. For whatever that's worth. I
do.
There is a sudden sound of "DOCTORS" laughing. JACOB jerks
his head painfully, but does not see them.
		"DOCTOR" (O.S.)
Dream on!
		JACOB
	(yelling at the unseen
	voice)
No! Oh God.
		SARAH
Jacob, what can I do?
		JACOB
Save me!
JACOB's plea confuses SARAH. She responds with a kiss.
INT.  HOSPITAL - DAY
DAYLIGHT streams through the window in JACOB's ROOM. He is
still in traction and looks very uncomfortable. A new NURSE
enters holding a plastic container with a straw poking out.
		NURSE
Well, don't we look better this
morning? That was a hard night,
wasn't it?
		JACOB
Where am I?
		NURSE
Lennox Hospital.
		JACOB
I'm awake?
		NURSE
You look awake to me. Here.
	(she holds the straw to
	his lips)
Drink some of this.
		JACOB
	(staring at her
	intently)
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?
	(the NURSE gives him a
	strange look)
She was here ...
		NURSE
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
		JACOB
That's a lie. My family was here.
		NURSE
I'm sorry.
		JACOB
Last night! They were as real as you
are!
The NURSE smiles and nods in appeasement.
		JACOB
This is not a dream! This is my life.
		NURSE
Of course it is. What else could it
be?
She giggles nervously. There is a funny glint in her eyes.
JACOB looks away. He doesn't want to see it.
OMIT
INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EVENING
There is a loud commotion in the HALL. We see LOUIS
SCHWARTZ, JACOB's chiropractor, screaming JACOB's name.
		LOUIS
Jacob! Jacob Singer!
JACOB yells.
		JACOB
Louis! I'm here! In here!
INT.  JACOB'S ROOM - DAY
LOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES
and ORDERLIES.
		JACOB
LOUIS!
		NURSE 1
You can't go in there!
		ORDERLY
You're going to have to leave.
LOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the
traction apparatus. He begins to yell.
		LOUIS
Good God, Jake. What have they done?
	(he examines JACOB and
	screams at the NURSES)
What is this, the Middle Ages? And
they call this modern medicine. This
is barbaric! Barbaric!
	(turning to JACOB)
It's okay, Jake. It's not serious.
I'll get you out of here.
	(yelling at the ORDERLY)
What is this, the Inquisition? Why
don't you just burn him at the stake
and put him out of his misery?
LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins
working the pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The
NURSES and ORDERLIES become instantly hysterical and start
screaming.
		ORDERLY
What the hell do you think ... ?
		LOUIS
Don't you come near me.
		NURSE 2
You can't do that!
		LOUIS
What is this, a prison? Stay back.
		NURSE 1
You can't. Call the police.
One of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him
with one of the pulley chains. It just misses.
		LOUIS
	(to the ORDERLIES)
You take one step and I'll wrap this
around your neck.
LOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the
others at bay.
		LOUIS
	(continuing)
Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of
here.
NURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the
room.
OMIT
INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING
LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that,
compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He
pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position.
JACOB leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal
position. Every moment is agony for him.
		LOUIS
Half an hour from now and you'll be
walking out of here all by yourself.
Mark my words.
	(JACOB barely hears
	them)
Well, you've done it to yourself this
time, haven't you?
		JACOB
	(nearly whispering)
Am I dead, Louis?
	(LOUIS leans over to
	hear)
Am I dead?
		LOUIS
	(smiling)
From a slipped disc? That'd be a
first.
		JACOB
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's
horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
		LOUIS
Well, I'll see what I can do about
it.
		JACOB
I've seen it. It's all pain.
		LOUIS
	(working on JACOB's
	spine like a master
	mechanic)
You ever read Meister Eckart?
	(JACOB shakes his head
	"no")
How did you ever get your Doctorate
without reading Eckart?
	(LOUIS takes hold of
	JACOB's legs and yanks
	them swiftly)
Good. Okay, let's turn over gently.
Right side.
JACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay.
		LOUIS
The other "right," okay?
	(he helps JACOB turn
	over)
You're a regular basket case, you
know that?
	(he moves JACOB's arm
	over his head)
Eckart saw Hell, too.
LOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then
pushes down on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking
sound. JACOB groans.
		LOUIS
	(continuing)
You know what he said? The only thing
that burns in Hell is the part of you
that won't let go of your life; your
memories, your attachments. They burn
'em all away. But they're not punish-
ing you, he said. They're freeing
your soul. Okay, other side.
He helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the
spine cracks.
		LOUIS
	(continuing)
Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if
you're frightened of dying and hold-
ing on, you'll see devils tearing
your life away. But if you've made
your peace then the devils are really
angels freeing you from the earth.
It's just a matter of how you look at
it, that's all. So don't worry, okay?
Relax. Wiggle your toes.
JACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected
jab to the lower vertebrae in his back.
		LOUIS
	(continuing)
Perfect. We got it.
	(LOUIS pushes a lever
	and the table rises back
	up)
Okay. Let's just give it a little
try. See if you can stand.
		JACOB
What? By myself?
		LOUIS
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just
give it a try.
JACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves
hesitantly, with deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him
like a faith healer coaxing the lame. His first steps have
an aura of the miraculous about them. JACOB walks slowly,
without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like a giant
cherub.
		LOUIS
Hallelujah.
LOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again,
gradually rediscovering his balance and strength. With each
step his confidence returns. LOUIS is pleased. Then,
suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns and heads toward the
door.
		LOUIS
What are you doing?
		JACOB
There's something I've gotta take
care of, Louis.
		LOUIS
What are you talking about? You can
barely stand.
		JACOB
I'm walking, aren't I?
		LOUIS
Jake, you need to rest.
		JACOB
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
He walks slowly out the door. LOUIS starts to go after him.
JACOB turns around and shakes his head "no." The look on his
face is firm and defiant. LOUIS stands back and lets him go.
		JACOB
I love you, Louis.
EXT.  U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
CUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the
streets of lower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of
lights and television cameras amass in the cold night air.
Police cars and mobile units rush to the scene.
CUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit
torch. In the other he is holding a container of gasoline
and pouring it on the steps of the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING
HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes against his pants
and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon
container lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it
insistently and pours onto the street. Bystanders back away
as the gasoline snakes toward them.
Television cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's
direction, but at a safe distance. He is yelling at them,
his teeth chattering from the cold.
		JACOB
Listen to me. There were four
companies in our batallion. Five
hundred men. Seven of us were left
when it was over. Seven! Four
companies engaged in an enemy
offensive that not one of us who
survived can remember fighting.
		BYSTANDERS
Use the torch!
		ONLOOKER
Shut up! Let him talk!
POLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene. FIREMEN ready
hoses at nearby hydrants. T.V. CAMERAS are rolling.
		JACOB
	(shouting)
You don't forget a battle where 500
men were killed. They did something
to us. I want to know the truth, the
goddamn truth. We have a right to
know.
	(he yells toward the
	cameras)
Are you getting all this? I want this
on national T.V. I want the whole
country, the whole world to know.
He holds up the torch. A loudspeaker blares through the
crowd.
		VOICE
Throw that torch away, young man.
Give yourself up. You're under
arrest.
		JACOB
For what? For seeking the truth?
		VOICE
Please come quietly.
		JACOB
You come near me and I'll blow us all
up.
		VOICE
We're not going to hurt you.
		ONLOOKER
Give him a chance to talk!
		JACOB
The army will deny it. They've
falsified my records. They've lied to
my lawyer, threatened my buddies. But
they can't threaten me.
		BYSTANDER
You tell 'em!
		BYSTANDER
Use the torch!
		VOICE
Okay, let's clear the area. Everyone
out.
Suddenly a lighted match flies in JACOB's direction. JACOB
is enraged. He brandishes the torch at the crowd.
		JACOB
What the fuck do you think you're
doing?
Another match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE
on the fringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not
move.
		VOICE
Clear the area. This is an order!
		JACOB
What is wrong with you?
We hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks
out into some of their eyes he sees demons looking back. One
of them throws another match. Crazed, JACOB runs toward
them. PEOPLE jump back.
Suddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees
one of the ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is
reaching for a gun. JACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis
lungs.
		JACOB
NO!
With a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the
air. We see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and
higher. All eyes stare upward watching it in a kind of
wonder. Then, reaching its apex, just below the camera, it
begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd turn to fear.
SOMEONE yells.
		ONLOOKER
He'll burn us all!
Screams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the
potential conflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless,
standing silently, almost heroically, in the middle of it
all.
Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline
ignites with a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in
all directions. PEOPLE panic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN
run for their lives. The ARMY OFFICIALS run, too. The flames
travel toward the Army Headquarters and rush along the curb.
Water hoses are trying to douse them as they spread. JACOB,
surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through the
frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the
flames the scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.
INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT
JACOB, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his
hands under a shower spray. The water is freezing and taking
forever to warm up. Anxious, he dashes past his gasoline
drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase from the BEDROOM closet,
and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries back to the
shower, tests it, and jumps in.
Lather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed
eyes. His entire body is covered in suds. He is washing as
quickly as he can. Suddenly he hears a noise as someone
enters the BATHROOM. He tenses.
		JACOB
Who's there? Who is it?
JACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes. They are
burning. There is a shadow behind the curtain.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Goddamn it! Who's there?
JACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower
curtain is thrown back. JACOB backs against the wall. A hand
reaches in and pulls his nipple, pinching hard.
		JEZZIE
It's just me.
		JACOB
Jezzie?
		JEZZIE
Who else were you expecting?
		JACOB
Let go!
		JEZZIE
Where were you, Jake? Where've you
been? Why haven't you called?
		JACOB
Stay away from me, Jez.
		JEZZIE
I want to know. You tell me!
		JACOB
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V.
Watch the fucking news!
He pushes her away and jumps out of the shower.
CUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes
into his suitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him.
		JEZZIE
Why are you doing this to me? You
can't just go away like that.
		JACOB
I can do anything I want.
She stares at him with confusion. THE PHONE RINGS.
		JACOB
Don't!
		JEZZIE
It might be for me.
		JACOB
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
		JEZZIE
	(picking up the
	receiver)
Hello ... No. He's not here. I
haven't seen him all night ... I
don't know when ... What? Tell him
what?
	(JACOB looks up)
Vietnam? ... What experiments?
JACOB lunges for the phone.
		JACOB
Hello. This is Jacob Singer.
	(he listens with growing
	fascination)
God almighty! ... Yes. Yes. Right.
Where would you like to meet?
	(he listens)
How will I know you.
	(JACOB seems
	uncomfortable)
Okay. I'll be there.
He hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment.
		JEZZIE
Who was that?
		JACOB
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare
unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me
and that I'll know him when I see him.
		JEZZIE
How?
		JACOB
I have no idea.
	(he thinks)
I was right. There were experiments.
I knew it. I knew it. My God.
		JEZZIE
How do you know he's telling the
truth?
JACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not
respond. The 11:00 NEWS is coming on. JACOB's image can be
seen on the screen. We hear the NEWSCASTER speaking.
		NEWSCASTER
Leading the news tonight, a bizarre
demonstration on the steps of the
U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in
downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an
alleged Vietnam vet ...
		JACOB
Alleged? Alleged?
		NEWSCASTER
... challenged the United States Army
to admit conducting secret experi-
ments involving hundreds of American
soldiers during the Vietnam war.
JEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his
suitcase and hurries to the front door. He opens it a crack
and peers into the hallway. JEZZIE runs after him.
		JEZZIE
	(almost threatening)
Don't leave me, Jake.
INT.  BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
JACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the
HALL. He stops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is
still standing there. She is very angry. JACOB just stares
at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell.
EXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN
in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at
JACOB with curiosity. One MAN in particular cruises by
several times and then approaches him.
		MICHAEL
Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.
Friends call me Mike.
JACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN
who has appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in
moments of crisis.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know
me. I've been tracking you for a long
time. I just wish I'd spoken to you
before tonight.
		JACOB
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have
you been following me?
		MICHAEL
Observation, mainly. Clinical study.
You were one of the survivors.
A POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs
JACOB's shoulder and turns him away nervously.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
Come on, we're not safe around here.
HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT
JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER
that juts into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he
listens to MICHAEL's story.
		MICHAEL
So first I'm arrested, right? Best
LSD I ever made, right down the
drain. I figure this is it, twenty
years in the joint, if I'm lucky.
That was '68.
		JACOB
Long time ago.
		MICHAEL
	(nodding his head)
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers
Island. Ever been there?
	(JACOB shakes his head)
Suddenly they take me from my cell to
the visitors room with those bank
teller windows, you know. Four army
colonels, medals up their asses, are
standing on the other side. They tell
me if I'll come to Vietnam for two
years, no action, mind you, just work
in a lab, they'll drop all the
charges and wipe the record clean.
Well, I'd only been in jail for
thirteen hours and I already knew
that Nam couldn't be any worse.
		JACOB
Shows how much you knew.
		MICHAEL
No shit. They had me by the balls.
Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ...
in a secret lab synthesizing mind-
altering drugs. Not the street stuff
mind you. They had us isolating
special properties. The dark side,
you know? They wanted a drug that
increased aggressive tendencies.
		JACOB
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
		MICHAEL
Right. They were worried. They
figured you guys were too soft. They
wanted something to stir you up, tap
into your anger, you know? And we did
it. The most powerful thing I ever
saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my
share, never compared to the fury of
the Ladder.
		JACOB
The Ladder?
		MICHAEL
That's what they called it. A fast
trip right down the ladder.
	(he makes a downward
	dive with his hand)
Right to the primal fear, the base
anger. I'm tellin' you, it was
powerful stuff. But I don't need to
tell you. You know.
JACOB can barely catch his breath, the information he is
receiving is so powerful to his mind.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
We did experiments on jungle monkeys.
They bashed each other's heads in,
gouged out their eyes, chewed off
their tails. The brass loved it. Then
they made us try it on Charlie.
	(he pauses)
They took these POW's, just kids
really, and put 'em in a courtyard.
We fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.
	(he stops for a moment;
	a tear rolls down his
	cheek)
They were worse than the monkeys. I
never knew men could do such things.
The whole thing still blows me away.
MICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the
PIER. JACOB, astounded, gets up and walks beside him.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
Anyway, this big offensive was coming
up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine,
Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was
scared 'cause they knew we couldn't
win. Morale was down. It was gettin'
ugly in the States. Hell, you
remember.
		JACOB
Like it was yesterday.
		MICHAEL
A couple days later they decided to
use the Ladder, on one test
battalion. Yours. Just in an
infintessimal dose in the food
supply, to prove its effectiveness in
the field. They were sure your unit
would have the highest kill ratio in
the whole goddamn offensive. And you
did, too. But not the way they
tnought.
JACOB is beginning to shake. MICHAEL pulls a container of
pills out of his jacket pocket.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
Hey, want something to calm you down?
Made 'em myself.
JACOB shakes his head no.
		JACOB
None of us can remember that night. I
get flashes of it but they don't make
sense. We saw shrinks for years. But
nothing they did could ever touch it.
What happened? Was there ever an
offensive?
		MICHAEL
A couple of days later. It was
fierce. You guys never saw it.
		JACOB
But there was an attack. I can still
see them coming. There was a fight,
wasn't there?
		MICHAEL
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
		JACOB
Who then?
He hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy.
He looks at the river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.
		MICHAEL
You killed each other.
JACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.
EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT
Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam.
JACOB is at the bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK.
Chaos surrounds them. Men are screaming. The ENEMY is
storming at them from the rear. ROD raises his bayonet and
jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only after a
series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's
killed. ROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.
		ROD
Oh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
JACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of
AMERICAN SOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up,
knocking JACOB to the ground and slamming his rifle into
JACOB's back. As he spins around JACOB sees another SOLDIER
charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at JACOB's stomach.
For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his attacker.
He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing
glasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible
confusion. It seems like a moment out of time. And then the
SOLDIER lurches forward and rams his bayonet deep into
JACOB's abdomen.
CUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.
		MICHAEL
It was brother against brother. No
discrimination. You tore each other
to pieces. I knew it would happen. I
warned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was
just a hippie chemist, right? Jesus!
And I helped 'em make the stuff ... I
talked to the guys who bagged the
bodies. They're in worse shape than
you, believe me. They saw what was
left. It's a blessing you don't
remember. Of course the brass covered
the whole thing up right away. Blamed
it all on a surprise attack.
	he pauses)
I needed to find you. The Ladder was
my baby.
Tears start flowing down MICHAEL's face. He wipes them with
his sleeve. It takes him a moment to regain his composure.
JACOB is shivering. MICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it
over JACOB, and leads him to the wooden planks overhanging
the water. They sit and gaze at the JERSEY SHORE.
CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.
		MICHAEL
I always suspected the effects might
come back. That's why I had to follow
you. I had a hell of a time getting
hold of your records.
		JACOB
If you knew, why didn't you say
anything?
		MICHAEL
The truth can kill, my friend. Five
hundred men died out there. This
isn't a story they'd ever want out.
When Paul's car blew up I realized
the scope of the thing. I knew they
meant business.
		JACOB
So why tell me now?
		MICHAEL
Because I can get rid of the demons.
I can block the Ladder. I have an
antidote. We can kill them off,
chemically speaking. They'll all
disappear. It's chemistry, my friend.
I know. I created it. Come with me. I
can help.
INT.  HOTEL - DAWM
JACOB and MICHAEL enter a sleazy HOTEL near the docks,
obviously frequented by a gay clientele. JACOB is
uncomfortable as they check in. MICHAEL, however, seems to
know the ropes. They go to a small room.
		JACOB
You come here often?
		MICHAEL
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
		JACOB
How do I know this isn't just some
kind of, you know, seduction or
something?
		MICHAEL
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got
bigger problems than me.
MICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a
vial.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
I came up with the formula back in
Nam but I never got a chance to use
it.
		JACOB
Never?
		MICHAEL
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just
open your mouth and stick out your
tongue.
		JACOB
What is it?
		MICHAEL
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your
head. Come on.
		JACOB
	(fearful)
I don't know.
		MICHAEL
"Yea though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death I shall fear
no evil," but no one ever said I
wouldn't be shittin' in my pants
every step of the way, huh?
	(JACOB smiles, his mouth
	open)
Stick out your tongue.
	(JACOB obeys as an
	eyedropper deposits a
	drop of liquid on the
	back of his tongue)
That'a boy. Now why don't you just
lie down and relax.
		JACOB
One drop?
		MICHAEL
It's strong stuff.
JACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling
and examines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and
shallow craters erode the surface. It is an alien terrain.
		JACOB
I think I'm falling asleep.
		MICHAEL
Pleasant dreams.
The words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get
up but can't. He's frightened.
		JACOB
I can't move.
		MICHAEL
Just relax.
		JACOB
What's happening? Help me.
The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge
crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is
crumbling. He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to
surge through the rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp
teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws
clamor to break through.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
HELP ME!
Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding
the vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of
the fluid and holds it over JACOB's mouth.
		MICHAEL
Take it!
JACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of
the eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit
it out, but can't.
Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole
chunks break off and collide like continental plates. The
collisons wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and
dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a
Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
Don't fight it. It's your own mind.
It's your own fears.
Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head,
thundering like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw
power and growing catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage
until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's eyes stare into
the formlessness expanding around him. All space is becoming
a dark liquid void.
Gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an
undulating sense to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like
comfort. Strange lights appear and sparkle before us like
sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing upward, toward the
surface.
With the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB
breaks through. To his amazement, he finds himself floating
out-stretched on shimmering sunlit water. Above him are
clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be
of the earth. Pillars of golden light reach down from the
heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a vision of
heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed.
A sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and
sees MICHAEL standing before him. Only MICHAEL looks
different. His face seems to radiate an inner light, a
transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly blinded by his
presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.
		MICHAEL
So, how you doin'?
The casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He
sits up. To his shock and amazement, he finds that he is
back in THE HOTEL ROOM. MICHAEL is standing at the foot of
the bed. JACOB is totally disoriented. His eyes move slowly
around the room, taking everything in. He doesn't speak.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
It was better than you expected, huh?
JACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly
begins to laugh. It is a huge laugh, full of energy and
life.
		MICHAEL
	(continuing)
And no more demons. I told you they'd
be gone.
		JACOB
I don't believe this. It's a miracle,
Michael. A miracle.
		MICHAEL
Better living through chemistry,
that's my motto.
EXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY
JACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF
GREENWICH VILLAGE. It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are
bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB stares into their faces and
beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys JACOB's
happiness.
EXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY
JACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.
		JACOB
It was paradise, Michael. You showed
it to me. You were there.
		MICHAEL
Well that's good to know.
		JACOB
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
		MICHAEL
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed
you enough of that stuff to send a
horse to heaven. I'm just glad you
came back.
		JACOB
I would have stayed there if I could.
		MICHAEL
I'm sure. You've got nothing but
troubles waitin' for you here.
He points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.
		MICHAEL
	(taking JACOB's arm)
Come on.
EXT.  GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY
The TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of
the GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL
pulls out a huge stack of credit cards and hands one to
JACOB.
		MICHAEL
Here. I've got every credit card ever
printed. Take this. Stay here till
you can arrange to get away. It's on
me.
		JACOB
No. I couldn't.
		MICHAEL
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be
foolish. Here. Take this, too.
	(he pulls out a business
	card)
This is my place on Prince Street.
It's got my phone, everything. Call
if you need me ... but you won't.
Everything's gonna work out. You just
get outta town as fast as you can.
The New York police can be effective
when they want to be.
		JACOB
I don't know what to say.
		MICHAEL
Save the words ... Just send back my
credit card.
MICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.
INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY
JACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE.
He is sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock
at the door. He jumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing
there. She looks at JACOB quizzically. He smiles and takes
her in his arms, swinging her into the room.
		JEZZIE
What are you doing here? Are you all
right? How do you expect to pay for
this?
	(JACOB smiles)
Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I
dodged people all over the place,
reporters, police. I don't know what
you're gonna do.
		JACOB
I'm gonna make love to you. That's
what I'm gonna do.
		JEZZIE
Are you out of your mind?
		JACOB
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
		JEZZIE
God, I can't keep up with all your
changes.
		JACOB
Me neither.
		JEZZIE
What's gotten into you?
JACOB grins.
CUT TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in bed gently caressing one
another. For all his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the
events of the preceding day. While stroking JEZZIE's hair he
begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on top of him and
shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles.
DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love.
							TIME CUT:
DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in front of the T.V.
watching a romantic movie. JEZZIE snuggles up to JACOB.
		JEZZIE
It's amazing, you know, that a drug
could change things like that,
destroy a life and then give it back.
It's hard to believe that the world
could be so hellish on day and like
heaven the next.
		JACOB
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I
felt like a little boy. I saw
Paradise, Jezzie.
		JEZZIE
It's so hard to believe.
There is a knock at the door. JACOB throws on a bathrobe.
JEZZIE jumps under the sheets.
		JACOB
Who's there?
		BELLBOY (V.O.)
It's your dinner, sir.
JEZZIE's eyes brighten. JACOB opens the door. A BELLBOY
wheels in a table set for dinner. He sets it in a corner of
the room. JEZZIE jumps out of bed, runs to the table, sniffs
at the food, and squeals excitedly.
		JEZZIE
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever
since I was a little girl. I never
thought it would happen.
		JACOB
Stick with me, kid.
JEZZIE smiles.
							TIME CUT:
DISSOLVE to JACOB and JEZZIE sitting next to a large window
overlooking GRAMERCY PARK. They are sipping champagne.
		JEZZIE
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever
you go.
		JACOB
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be
hard enough alone.
		JEZZIE
I can waitress. I'm good.
		JACOB
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll
send for you.
		JEZZIE
Bullshit!
		JACOB
I promise.
		JEZZIE
Please.
		JACOB
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the
only one left. I don't want to expose
you to that. It's not right for you
or me. Be reasonable.
		JEZZIE
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ...
You're gettin' me angry.
		JACOB
I love you when you're angry.
		JEZZIE
Oh yeah?
	(her eyes twinkle
	suggestively)
Try leavin' without me.
JACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB
and pushes him onto the bed. In seconds they are all over
each other, their clothes flying in all directions. They
seem as happy as could be.
OMIT
INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
JACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the
PEOPLE around him. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the
TICKET WINDOW he gets in line. The TICKET SELLER looks up.
		JACOB
Chicago. One way. For tomorrow.
		SELLER
How many?
		JACOB
One.
		SELLER
That'll be $119.75.
JACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it
up. While he is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at
him. The stare unsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his
ticket. He takes it and hurries into the CROWD. Looking back
he notices the POLICEMAN is following him.
INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY
JACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the
stalsls, drops his pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on
the walls and then notices a wad of tissue stuffed into a
hole between him and the next stall. It is moving. Suddenly
the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the hole
curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to
see an eye staring back at him.
		JACOB
Goddamn it!
	(he covers it with his
	hand. A pencil jabs his
	palm. He yells)
Fucking pervert.
Two lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely.
		VOICE
Dream on!
		JACOB
	(shocked)
What?!
The mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and
feet running from the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants.
He dashes out of the MEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and
chases after them.
INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
JACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing
toward the main doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE,
huddling along the corridors, watch as they run past.
Escaping to the street, the MAN disappears in the holiday
throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for breath. His fists
dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something and
seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands.
OMIT
INT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING
JACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a
dingy, industrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door
with MICHAEL's name painted on it in large black letters. He
knocks loudly. There is no answer. He pounds on it. Another
door opens on the floor above. A head sticks out.
		MAN
You lookin' for Mike?
		JACOB
	(panting hard)
Where is he?
		MAN
Don't know. Hasn't picked his mail up
in days. It's not like him.
JACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around
the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner.
He grabs a two-by-four and lunges at the door.
		MAN
What the hell are you doing?
JACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until
the lock flies open.
INT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING
JACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He
finds it. The LOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing.
JACOB runs from room to room. In the back he discovers a
large private chemistry lab. Glass vials and bottles are
shattered on the floor.
JACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact
but their labels mean nothing to him.
He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid
oozing out from the bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed
head stares him in the face. It is smiling.
A scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB
has seen. JACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's
headless body. It is lying sprawled across the floor.
		MAN
Oh my God!
JACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of
unrelieved panic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the
doorr. He takes two and three stairs at a time, nearly
flying to the street.
EXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT
JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the
sidewalk as fast as his legs will move. With unexpected
violence he charges into the side of a building. Over and
over he hurls himself against it. He grabs for the bricks.
His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is as
though he is trying to merge with the wall.
Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is
speeding toward him, its lights the only sign of life and
warmth in the dark night. JACOB steps into its path. It is
hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to
be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB stares at it a
moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to pull
off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.
INT.  TAXI - NIGHT
Rain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows.
		JACOB
	(barely audible)
I'm going to Brooklyn.
		DRIVER
Sorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I
get lost in Brooklyn.
		JACOB
I know the way.
JACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty
dollar bill, and hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Look, this is all the money I've got
in the world. Take me home and it's
yours.
		DRIVER
... Where's your home?
CUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY, approaching the
BROOKLYN BRIDGE, crossing the EAST RIVER, and driving
through dark BROOKLYN STREETS.
JACOB's face passes in and out of dense shadows. Every time
he is bathed in light his image seems to alter. Something in
him is falling away.
EXT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
JACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of
SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.
		DOORMAN
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
		JACOB
	(greeting him warmly)
Hello, Sam.
		DOORMAN
	(noticing JACOB's
	battered condition)
Are you all right?
		JACOB
I'm okay.
		DOORMAN
Do you want some help? I can call
upstairs.
		JACOB
No, don't. But thanks.
INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
JACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his
hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes
back with a key. He inserts it into the lock and gently
opens the door. He calls out.
		JACOB
Hello. It's me.
INT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Some lights are on. The APARTMENT looks comfortable and
cozy.
		JACOB
Hello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli?
Daddy's here.
There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He peers into
the dark LIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN. No one
is around. A photo of JACOB, SARAH, AND THEIR BOYS is
sitting on the counter. He picks it up and carries it with
him through the apartment. He walks into his old BEDROOM and
then into the BOYS' ROOM. The beds are still unmade. There
is no one home. He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and
turns away in disgust. He walks back to the LIVING ROOM. He
is about to switch the lights on when he hears footsteps
coming down the hall. He calls out.
		JACOB
Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't
mind. I needed to come home.
JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not
seem he usual self. She appears larger, more imposing.
		JEZZIE
Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here
in the end.
JACOB is nervous.
		JACOB
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah?
Where are the boys?
		JEZZIE
Sit down, Jake.
		JACOB
Where are they?
		JEZZIE
Sit down.
		JACOB
No! What's going on? Where's my
family?
		JEZZIE
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
		JACOB
Where have they gone?
		JEZZIE
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself.
It's finished.
JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare.
The edge of her coat rustles and flutters as she moves
toward him. It is an innocent sound at first, but after a
moment it transforms into something else, an obsessive
flapping noise, the sound of a wing.
JACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His
legs are shaking.
		JACOB
What's going on?
		JEZZIE
Your capacity for self-delusion is
remarkable, Dr. Singer.
JEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she
talks to him. Something about her walk is very unnatural.
JACOB eyes her fearfully.
In the darkness JEZZIE's movements become increasingly
strange and elusive. We see her pass before a shadow and
disappear within it, only to reappear, seconds later, in a
doorway on the other side of the room. JACOB spins around,
confused. Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face, although
it seems like there has been no time for her to get there.
Her movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all
physical laws.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
What's wrong, Jake?
	(she mocks him)
Forget to take your antidote?
		JACOB
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
		JEZZIE
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved
your friends. That chemist - the
Ladder. What an imagination you have!
JACOB freezes.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
And your vision of paradise ...
fantastic! You're a real dreamer, you
know that? Only it's time to wake up.
JEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room. Only the
sounds of flapping wings remain. They grow louder and more
menacing, whooshing past him with no visible source.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Your mind is crumbling, Jake. No more
"army." No more conspiracies. You're
dying, Dr. Singer. It's over.
JACOB, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out.
"JEZZIE" laughs.
		JEZZIE
	(continuing)
Where's to run, Jacob? Where's to go?
JACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror
behind him.
		JACOB
WHO ARE YOU?
		JEZZIE
How many times have you asked me
that? How many times?
		JACOB
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
		JEZZIE
	(with consummate power)
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
JEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures
her and it seems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to
JACOB's horror, she turns around. He is staring at the
vibrating creature he has seen so often before. Glimpsed
almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and
undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in
constant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry,
the essence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it,
overhwelmed by confusion. He is rooted in fear.
A sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing
JACOB's hair straight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him
into the wall. He can barely stand. He struggles to pull
himself away. The flapping sound returns, charging at him
from all directions. It is as if the darkness itself is
swooping down, trying to envelop him.
		JACOB
	(whispering to himself)
This isn't happening.
New terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the
air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with
unrelenting anger. Guns fire and explode past his head. It
is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on
him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the melee.
Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.
Suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as
if from a distance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear
him. He stands motionless.
		LOUIS (V.O.)
If you're frightened of dying you'll
see devils tearing you apart. If
you've made your peace then they're
angels freeing you from the world.
The voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to
do. And then the sounds return. Only now they are more
terrifying than ever. Hideously loud, they become a
cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the
sounds of battle, fighting, and dying.
JACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the
room. All the sounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB
stares at it the louder they become. After a moment, JACOB
takes a huge breath. We sense a great resolve forming inside
him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it.
NEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to
drive him back, but he will not be stopped. He continues
walking toward the creature.
In the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor.
It rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a
maddening hypnotic regularity. Doors slam open and closed,
unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force. The
room itself seems like an organic presence. It is alive,
angry, and threatening.
The CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the
source of madness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates
with unstoppable fury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting,
continues to approach it.
AS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the
density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen. It is
like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness.
With superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It
is like grabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins
shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted. He is
flying in all directions but does not let go. His fingers
claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles defiantly with
the monster.
Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.
		CREATURE
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING!
JACOB does not respond. It cries out again.
		CREATURE
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
FIGHTING?
Deep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the
presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking
before us. It looks briefly like an animal until we realize
it is the image of a human face. It is covered by a dark
suffocating film, like a mask.
JACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.
							CUT TO:
DEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him
from beneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw
him on the battlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is
pale and lifeless. It takes JACOB a moment to realize that
he is dead. The recognition is one of terrible confusion and
pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry
wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating
sadness.
As that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a
flash of catacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's
life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his
adulthood. The demons, the room, JEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL,
SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding
intensity.
We are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a
constantly changing field of images. Some of the images
move, some of the people in them speak. They are not
particularly significant memories, in some ways they are
quite banal, but something about them is infused with life
and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force.
Some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent
with JACOB. Some we have not seen before. There is no order
to them, no logic to why they have been recalled.
A newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH
pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's
FATHER stands in the Florida surf as sea foam laps gently at
his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play cards on the edge of a
rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of an oncoming
car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal,
listening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway
lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH
slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks
at JACOB and asks "Love me a little?"
And then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a
wonderful soothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked
to find himself sitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment.
He is all alone. The first rays of early morning sunlight
are filtering through the window. Something about the
apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits
motionless, stunned to be back there.
The faint sound of music can be heard coming from the
hallway. It is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music
box. JACOB listens to it for a few moments and then
something registers inside him. Curious, he gets up and
approaches the corridor.
		JACOB
Hello?
There is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB
freezes for a moment. He sees someone standing in the
shadows at the other end.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Who is it? Who's there?
Tentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he
begins to see the outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden,
he realizes who it is. His eyes well up as he stands there,
the full impact of the moment registering inside him. It's
his son, GABE. He is carrying the same musical lunch box we
have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at his father.
It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Gabe? Gabe!
JACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he
embraces him in a rush of love and emotion.
		JACOB
	(continuing)
Gabe. Oh God. I don't believe ...
They hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits
down on the stiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around
his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity
and compassion. We sense for an instant that their roles
have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand and gently
encourages him to stand up.
With a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps.
Sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting
the first landing. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB
reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting
light.
GABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to
follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring
in from above. Squinting, he cannot see his son. Then
suddenly GABE steps back out of the light and takes his
father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with excitement.
		GABE
Come on Dad ... You know what we've
got? A sandbox just like the
Williston's, only it's bigger and the
sand's all white. You won't believe
it.
JACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment
of total euphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the
stairs.
		GABE
	(continuing)
And my parakeet. Remember, the one
grandma let out of the cage? He's
okay. And he's talking now. He knows
my name.
GABE's voice slowly trails off as he and his father
disappear in the intenstity of the light. THE CAMERA HOLDS
on the image. For a brief but stunning moment there appears
to be a huge ethereal staircase shimmering before us. It
rises up into infinite dimensions. Then the brilliance of
its blinding light overwhelms the screen.
Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light
source. It holds for a second and then flashes off. An
overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view.
INT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY
A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his
mask. His expression is somber. He shakes his head. His
words are simple and final.
		DOCTOR
He's gone.
CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large
ARMY FIELD TENT in VIETNAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE
rudely pulls a green sheet over his head. The DOCTOR turns
to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat.
AN ORDERLY wheels JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS
and NURSES fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY
pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent. It is
a bright, fresh morning. The sun is rising.
		THE END

 PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Please be seated.
It is a great honor to return to the National Defense University.  Here, at Fort McNair, Americans have served in uniform since 1791 — standing guard in the earliest days of the Republic, and contemplating the future of warfare here in the 21st century.
For over two centuries, the United States has been bound together by founding documents that defined who we are as Americans, and served as our compass through every type of change.  Matters of war and peace are no different.  Americans are deeply ambivalent about war, but having fought for our independence, we know a price must be paid for freedom.  From the Civil War to our struggle against fascism, on through the long twilight struggle of the Cold War, battlefields have changed and technology has evolved.  But our commitment to constitutional principles has weathered every war, and every war has come to an end.
With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a new dawn of democracy took hold abroad, and a decade of peace and prosperity arrived here at home.  And for a moment, it seemed the 21st century would be a tranquil time.  And then, on September 11, 2001, we were shaken out of complacency.  Thousands were taken from us, as clouds of fire and metal and ash descended upon a sun-filled morning.  This was a different kind of war.  No armies came to our shores, and our military was not the principal target.  Instead, a group of terrorists came to kill as many civilians as they could.
And so our nation went to war.  We have now been at war for well over a decade.  I won’t review the full history.  What is clear is that we quickly drove al Qaeda out of Afghanistan, but then shifted our focus and began a new war in Iraq.  And this carried significant consequences for our fight against al Qaeda, our standing in the world, and — to this day — our interests in a vital region.
Meanwhile, we strengthened our defenses — hardening targets, tightening transportation security, giving law enforcement new tools to prevent terror.  Most of these changes were sound.  Some caused inconvenience.  But some, like expanded surveillance, raised difficult questions about the balance that we strike between our interests in security and our values of privacy.  And in some cases, I believe we compromised our basic values — by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law.
So after I took office, we stepped up the war against al Qaeda but we also sought to change its course.  We relentlessly targeted al Qaeda’s leadership.  We ended the war in Iraq, and brought nearly 150,000 troops home.  We pursued a new strategy in Afghanistan, and increased our training of Afghan forces.  We unequivocally banned torture, affirmed our commitment to civilian courts, worked to align our policies with the rule of law, and expanded our consultations with Congress.
Today, Osama bin Laden is dead, and so are most of his top lieutenants.  There have been no large-scale attacks on the United States, and our homeland is more secure.  Fewer of our troops are in harm’s way, and over the next 19 months they will continue to come home.  Our alliances are strong, and so is our standing in the world.  In sum, we are safer because of our efforts.
Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists.  From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth.  But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11.  With a decade of experience now to draw from, this is the moment to ask ourselves hard questions — about the nature of today’s threats and how we should confront them.
And these questions matter to every American.
For over the last decade, our nation has spent well over a trillion dollars on war, helping to explode our deficits and constraining our ability to nation-build here at home.  Our servicemembers and their families have sacrificed far more on our behalf.  Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice. Many more have left a part of themselves on the battlefield, or brought the shadows of battle back home.  From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation — and world — that we leave to our children.

So America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.  We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.”  Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror.  We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society.  But what we can do — what we must do — is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger to us, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all the while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.  And to define that strategy, we have to make decisions based not on fear, but on hard-earned wisdom.  That begins with understanding the current threat that we face.
Today, the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat.  Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us.  They did not direct the attacks in Benghazi or Boston.  They’ve not carried out a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11.
Instead, what we’ve seen is the emergence of various al Qaeda affiliates.  From Yemen to Iraq, from Somalia to North Africa, the threat today is more diffuse, with Al Qaeda’s affiliates in the Arabian Peninsula — AQAP — the most active in plotting against our homeland.  And while none of AQAP’s efforts approach the scale of 9/11, they have continued to plot acts of terror, like the attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009.
Unrest in the Arab world has also allowed extremists to gain a foothold in countries like Libya and Syria.  But here, too, there are differences from 9/11.  In some cases, we continue to confront state-sponsored networks like Hezbollah that engage in acts of terror to achieve political goals.  Other of these groups are simply collections of local militias or extremists interested in seizing territory.  And while we are vigilant for signs that these groups may pose a transnational threat, most are focused on operating in the countries and regions where they are based.  And that means we’ll face more localized threats like what we saw in Benghazi, or the BP oil facility in Algeria, in which local operatives — perhaps in loose affiliation with regional networks — launch periodic attacks against Western diplomats, companies, and other soft targets, or resort to kidnapping and other criminal enterprises to fund their operations.
And finally, we face a real threat from radicalized individuals here in the United States.  Whether it’s a shooter at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, a plane flying into a building in Texas, or the extremists who killed 168 people at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, America has confronted many forms of violent extremism in our history.  Deranged or alienated individuals — often U.S. citizens or legal residents — can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of violent jihad.  And that pull towards extremism appears to have led to the shooting at Fort Hood and the bombing of the Boston Marathon.
So that’s the current threat — lethal yet less capable al Qaeda affiliates; threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad; homegrown extremists.  This is the future of terrorism. We have to take these threats seriously, and do all that we can to confront them.  But as we shape our response, we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11.
In the 1980s, we lost Americans to terrorism at our Embassy in Beirut; at our Marine Barracks in Lebanon; on a cruise ship at sea; at a disco in Berlin; and on a Pan Am flight — Flight 103  — over Lockerbie.  In the 1990s, we lost Americans to terrorism at the World Trade Center; at our military facilities in Saudi Arabia; and at our Embassy in Kenya.  These attacks were all brutal; they were all deadly; and we learned that left unchecked, these threats can grow.  But if dealt with smartly and proportionally, these threats need not rise to the level that we saw on the eve of 9/11.

Moreover, we have to recognize that these threats don’t arise in a vacuum.  Most, though not all, of the terrorism we faced is fueled by a common ideology — a belief by some extremists that Islam is in conflict with the United States and the West, and that violence against Western targets, including civilians, is justified in pursuit of a larger cause.  Of course, this ideology is based on a lie, for the United States is not at war with Islam.  And this ideology is rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, who are the most frequent victims of terrorist attacks.
Nevertheless, this ideology persists, and in an age when ideas and images can travel the globe in an instant, our response to terrorism can’t depend on military or law enforcement alone. We need all elements of national power to win a battle of wills, a battle of ideas.  So what I want to discuss here today is the components of such a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy.
First, we must finish the work of defeating al Qaeda and its associated forces.
In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security.  Our troops will come home.  Our combat mission will come to an end.  And we will work with the Afghan government to train security forces, and sustain a counterterrorism force, which ensures that al Qaeda can never again establish a safe haven to launch attacks against us or our allies.
Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.  In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.  Already, thousands of Pakistani soldiers have lost their lives fighting extremists.  In Yemen, we are supporting security forces that have reclaimed territory from AQAP.  In Somalia, we helped a coalition of African nations push al-Shabaab out of its strongholds.  In Mali, we’re providing military aid to French-led intervention to push back al Qaeda in the Maghreb, and help the people of Mali reclaim their future.
Much of our best counterterrorism cooperation results in the gathering and sharing of intelligence, the arrest and prosecution of terrorists.  And that’s how a Somali terrorist apprehended off the coast of Yemen is now in a prison in New York.  That’s how we worked with European allies to disrupt plots from Denmark to Germany to the United Kingdom.  That’s how intelligence collected with Saudi Arabia helped us stop a cargo plane from being blown up over the Atlantic.  These partnerships work.
But despite our strong preference for the detention and prosecution of terrorists, sometimes this approach is foreclosed. Al Qaeda and its affiliates try to gain foothold in some of the most distant and unforgiving places on Earth.  They take refuge in remote tribal regions.  They hide in caves and walled compounds.  They train in empty deserts and rugged mountains.
In some of these places — such as parts of Somalia and Yemen — the state only has the most tenuous reach into the territory.  In other cases, the state lacks the capacity or will to take action.  And it’s also not possible for America to simply deploy a team of Special Forces to capture every terrorist.  Even when such an approach may be possible, there are places where it would pose profound risks to our troops and local civilians — where a terrorist compound cannot be breached without triggering a firefight with surrounding tribal communities, for example, that pose no threat to us; times when putting U.S. boots on the ground may trigger a major international crisis.

To put it another way, our operation in Pakistan against Osama bin Laden cannot be the norm.  The risks in that case were immense.  The likelihood of capture, although that was our preference, was remote given the certainty that our folks would confront resistance.  The fact that we did not find ourselves confronted with civilian casualties, or embroiled in an extended firefight, was a testament to the meticulous planning and professionalism of our Special Forces, but it also depended on some luck.  And it was supported by massive infrastructure in Afghanistan.
And even then, the cost to our relationship with Pakistan — and the backlash among the Pakistani public over encroachment on their territory — was so severe that we are just now beginning to rebuild this important partnership.
So it is in this context that the United States has taken lethal, targeted action against al Qaeda and its associated forces, including with remotely piloted aircraft commonly referred to as drones.
As was true in previous armed conflicts, this new technology raises profound questions — about who is targeted, and why; about civilian casualties, and the risk of creating new enemies; about the legality of such strikes under U.S. and international law; about accountability and morality.  So let me address these questions.
To begin with, our actions are effective.  Don’t take my word for it.  In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden’s compound, we found that he wrote, “We could lose the reserves to enemy’s air strikes.  We cannot fight air strikes with explosives.”  Other communications from al Qaeda operatives confirm this as well.  Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield.  Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities and our troops in Afghanistan.  Simply put, these strikes have saved lives.
Moreover, America’s actions are legal.  We were attacked on 9/11.  Within a week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized the use of force.  Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.  So this is a just war — a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.
And yet, as our fight enters a new phase, America’s legitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion.  To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance.  For the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power — or risk abusing it.  And that’s why, over the last four years, my administration has worked vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use of force against terrorists –- insisting upon clear guidelines, oversight and accountability that is now codified in Presidential Policy Guidance that I signed yesterday.
In the Afghan war theater, we must — and will — continue to support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014.  And that means we will continue to take strikes against high value al Qaeda targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces.  But by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection, and the progress we’ve made against core al Qaeda will reduce the need for unmanned strikes.
Beyond the Afghan theater, we only target al Qaeda and its associated forces.  And even then, the use of drones is heavily constrained.  America does not take strikes when we have the ability to capture individual terrorists; our preference is always to detain, interrogate, and prosecute.  America cannot take strikes wherever we choose; our actions are bound by consultations with partners, and respect for state sovereignty.
America does not take strikes to punish individuals; we act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people, and when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat.  And before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured — the highest standard we can set.
Now, this last point is critical, because much of the criticism about drone strikes — both here at home and abroad — understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties.  There’s a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties and nongovernmental reports.  Nevertheless, it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in every war.  And for the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss.  For me, and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred throughout conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives.  To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties — not just in our cities at home and our facilities abroad, but also in the very places like Sana’a and Kabul and Mogadishu where terrorists seek a foothold.  Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes.  So doing nothing is not an option.
Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted lethal action would be the use of conventional military options.  As I’ve already said, even small special operations carry enormous risks.  Conventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones, and are likely to cause more civilian casualties and more local outrage.  And invasions of these territories lead us to be viewed as occupying armies, unleash a torrent of unintended consequences, are difficult to contain, result in large numbers of civilian casualties and ultimately empower those who thrive on violent conflict.
So it is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the Muslim world.  The results would be more U.S. deaths, more Black Hawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars.
Yes, the conflict with al Qaeda, like all armed conflict, invites tragedy.  But by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life.
Our efforts must be measured against the history of putting American troops in distant lands among hostile populations.  In Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of civilians died in a war where the boundaries of battle were blurred.  In Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the extraordinary courage and discipline of our troops, thousands of civilians have been killed.  So neither conventional military action nor waiting for attacks to occur offers moral safe harbor, and neither does a sole reliance on law enforcement in territories that have no functioning police or security services — and indeed, have no functioning law.
Now, this is not to say that the risks are not real.  Any U.S. military action in foreign lands risks creating more enemies and impacts public opinion overseas.  Moreover, our laws constrain the power of the President even during wartime, and I have taken an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States.  The very precision of drone strikes and the necessary secrecy often involved in such actions can end up shielding our government from the public scrutiny that a troop deployment invites.  It can also lead a President and his team to view drone strikes as a cure-all for terrorism.
And for this reason, I’ve insisted on strong oversight of all lethal action.  After I took office, my administration began briefing all strikes outside of Iraq and Afghanistan to the appropriate committees of Congress.  Let me repeat that:  Not only did Congress authorize the use of force, it is briefed on every strike that America takes.  Every strike.  That includes the one instance when we targeted an American citizen — Anwar Awlaki, the chief of external operations for AQAP.
This week, I authorized the declassification of this action, and the deaths of three other Americans in drone strikes, to facilitate transparency and debate on this issue and to dismiss some of the more outlandish claims that have been made.  For the record, I do not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. citizen — with a drone, or with a shotgun — without due process, nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. soil.
But when a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens, and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team.
That’s who Anwar Awlaki was — he was continuously trying to kill people.  He helped oversee the 2010 plot to detonate explosive devices on two U.S.-bound cargo planes.  He was involved in planning to blow up an airliner in 2009.  When Farouk Abdulmutallab — the Christmas Day bomber — went to Yemen in 2009, Awlaki hosted him, approved his suicide operation, helped him tape a martyrdom video to be shown after the attack, and his last instructions were to blow up the airplane when it was over American soil.  I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldn’t.  And as President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out.
Of course, the targeting of any American raises constitutional issues that are not present in other strikes — which is why my administration submitted information about Awlaki to the Department of Justice months before Awlaki was killed, and briefed the Congress before this strike as well.  But the high threshold that we’ve set for taking lethal action applies to all potential terrorist targets, regardless of whether or not they are American citizens.  This threshold respects the inherent dignity of every human life.  Alongside the decision to put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way, the decision to use force against individuals or groups — even against a sworn enemy of the United States — is the hardest thing I do as President.  But these decisions must be made, given my responsibility to protect the American people.
Going forward, I’ve asked my administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of warzones that go beyond our reporting to Congress.  Each option has virtues in theory, but poses difficulties in practice.  For example, the establishment of a special court to evaluate and authorize lethal action has the benefit of bringing a third branch of government into the process, but raises serious constitutional issues about presidential and judicial authority. Another idea that’s been suggested — the establishment of an independent oversight board in the executive branch — avoids those problems, but may introduce a layer of bureaucracy into national security decision-making, without inspiring additional public confidence in the process.  But despite these challenges, I look forward to actively engaging Congress to explore these and other options for increased oversight.
I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a larger discussion we need to have about a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy — because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe.  We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root; and in the absence of a strategy that reduces the wellspring of extremism, a perpetual war — through drones or Special Forces or troop deployments — will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways.
So the next element of our strategy involves addressing the underlying grievances and conflicts that feed extremism — from North Africa to South Asia.  As we’ve learned this past decade, this is a vast and complex undertaking.  We must be humble in our expectation that we can quickly resolve deep-rooted problems like poverty and sectarian hatred.  Moreover, no two countries are alike, and some will undergo chaotic change before things get better.  But our security and our values demand that we make the effort.
This means patiently supporting transitions to democracy in places like Egypt and Tunisia and Libya — because the peaceful realization of individual aspirations will serve as a rebuke to violent extremists.  We must strengthen the opposition in Syria, while isolating extremist elements — because the end of a tyrant must not give way to the tyranny of terrorism.  We are actively working to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians — because it is right and because such a peace could help reshape attitudes in the region.  And we must help countries modernize economies, upgrade education, and encourage entrepreneurship — because American leadership has always been elevated by our ability to connect with people’s hopes, and not simply their fears.
And success on all these fronts requires sustained engagement, but it will also require resources.  I know that foreign aid is one of the least popular expenditures that there is.  That’s true for Democrats and Republicans — I’ve seen the polling — even though it amounts to less than one percent of the federal budget.  In fact, a lot of folks think it’s 25 percent, if you ask people on the streets.  Less than one percent — still wildly unpopular.  But foreign assistance cannot be viewed as charity.  It is fundamental to our national security.  And it’s fundamental to any sensible long-term strategy to battle extremism.
Moreover, foreign assistance is a tiny fraction of what we spend fighting wars that our assistance might ultimately prevent. For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height of the war, we could be training security forces in Libya, maintaining peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, feeding the hungry in Yemen, building schools in Pakistan, and creating reservoirs of goodwill that marginalize extremists.  That has to be part of our strategy.
Moreover, America cannot carry out this work if we don’t have diplomats serving in some very dangerous places.  Over the past decade, we have strengthened security at our embassies, and I am implementing every recommendation of the Accountability Review Board, which found unacceptable failures in Benghazi.  I’ve called on Congress to fully fund these efforts to bolster security and harden facilities, improve intelligence, and facilitate a quicker response time from our military if a crisis emerges.
But even after we take these steps, some irreducible risks to our diplomats will remain.  This is the price of being the world’s most powerful nation, particularly as a wave of change washes over the Arab World.  And in balancing the trade4offs between security and active diplomacy, I firmly believe that any retreat from challenging regions will only increase the dangers that we face in the long run.  And that’s why we should be grateful to those diplomats who are willing to serve.
Targeted action against terrorists, effective partnerships, diplomatic engagement and assistance — through such a comprehensive strategy we can significantly reduce the chances of large-scale attacks on the homeland and mitigate threats to Americans overseas.  But as we guard against dangers from abroad, we cannot neglect the daunting challenge of terrorism from within our borders.
As I said earlier, this threat is not new.  But technology and the Internet increase its frequency and in some cases its lethality.  Today, a person can consume hateful propaganda, commit themselves to a violent agenda, and learn how to kill without leaving their home.  To address this threat, two years ago my administration did a comprehensive review and engaged with law enforcement.
And the best way to prevent violent extremism inspired by violent jihadists is to work with the Muslim American community  — which has consistently rejected terrorism — to identify signs of radicalization and partner with law enforcement when an individual is drifting towards violence.  And these partnerships can only work when we recognize that Muslims are a fundamental part of the American family.  In fact, the success of American Muslims and our determination to guard against any encroachments on their civil liberties is the ultimate rebuke to those who say that we’re at war with Islam.
Thwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in part because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all who call America home.  That’s why, in the years to come, we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are.  That means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement, so we can intercept new types of communication, but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse.
That means that — even after Boston — we do not deport someone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of evidence.  That means putting careful constraints on the tools the government uses to protect sensitive information, such as the state secrets doctrine.  And that means finally having a strong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension.
The Justice Department’s investigation of national security leaks offers a recent example of the challenges involved in striking the right balance between our security and our open society.  As Commander-in-Chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field.  To do so, we must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach their commitment to protect classified information.  But a free press is also essential for our democracy.  That’s who we are.  And I’m troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.
Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs.  Our focus must be on those who break the law.  And that’s why I’ve called on Congress to pass a media shield law to guard against government overreach.  And I’ve raised these issues with the Attorney General, who shares my concerns.  So he has agreed to review existing Department of Justice guidelines governing investigations that involve reporters, and he’ll convene a group of media organizations to hear their concerns as part of that review.  And I’ve directed the Attorney General to report back to me by July 12th.
Now, all these issues remind us that the choices we make about war can impact — in sometimes unintended ways — the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends.  And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing Authorization to Use Military Force, or AUMF, to determine how we can continue to fight terrorism without keeping America on a perpetual wartime footing.
The AUMF is now nearly 12 years old.  The Afghan war is coming to an end.  Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former self.  Groups like AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States.  Unless we discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states.
So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate.  And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further.  Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue.  But this war, like all wars, must end.  That’s what history advises.  That’s what our democracy demands.
And that brings me to my final topic:  the detention of terrorist suspects.  I’m going to repeat one more time:  As a matter of policy, the preference of the United States is to capture terrorist suspects.  When we do detain a suspect, we interrogate them.  And if the suspect can be prosecuted, we decide whether to try him in a civilian court or a military commission.  
During the past decade, the vast majority of those detained by our military were captured on the battlefield.  In Iraq, we turned over thousands of prisoners as we ended the war.  In Afghanistan, we have transitioned detention facilities to the Afghans, as part of the process of restoring Afghan sovereignty. So we bring law of war detention to an end, and we are committed to prosecuting terrorists wherever we can.
The glaring exception to this time-tested approach is the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.  The original premise for opening GTMO — that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention — was found unconstitutional five years ago.  In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.  Our allies won’t cooperate with us if they think a terrorist will end up at GTMO.
During a time of budget cuts, we spend $150 million each year to imprison 166 people — almost $1 million per prisoner.  And the Department of Defense estimates that we must spend another $200 million to keep GTMO open at a time when we’re cutting investments in education and research here at home, and when the Pentagon is struggling with sequester and budget cuts.
As President, I have tried to close GTMO.  I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries or imprisoning them here in the United States.
These restrictions make no sense.  After all, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congress’s support.  When I ran for President the first time, John McCain supported closing GTMO — this was a bipartisan issue.  No person has ever escaped one of our super-max or military prisons here in the United States — ever.  Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism or terrorism-related offenses, including some folks who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees.  They’re in our prisons.
And given my administration’s relentless pursuit of al Qaeda’s leadership, there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should have never have been opened.  (Applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Excuse me, President Obama –
MR. OBAMA:  So — let me finish, ma’am.  So today, once again –
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  There are 102 people on a hunger strike.  These are desperate people.
MR. OBAMA:  I’m about to address it, ma’am, but you’ve got to let me speak.  I’m about to address it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  You’re our Commander-In-Chief –
MR. OBAMA:  Let me address it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  — you an close Guantanamo Bay.
MR. OBAMA:  Why don’t you let me address it, ma’am.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  There’s still prisoners –
MR. OBAMA:  Why don’t you sit down and I will tell you exactly what I’m going to do.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  That includes 57 Yemenis.
MR. OBAMA:  Thank you, ma’am.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Ma’am, thank you.  You should let me finish my sentence.
Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO.  (Applause.)
I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions.  I’m appointing a new senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries.
I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen so we can review them on a case-by-case basis.  To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  — prisoners already.  Release them today.
MR. OBAMA:  Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and our military justice system.  And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  It needs to be –
THE PRESIDENT:  Now, ma’am, let me finish.  Let me finish, ma’am.  Part of free speech is you being able to speak, but also, you listening and me being able to speak.  (Applause.)
Now, even after we take these steps one issue will remain — just how to deal with those GTMO detainees who we know have participated in dangerous plots or attacks but who cannot be prosecuted, for example, because the evidence against them has been compromised or is inadmissible in a court of law.  But once we commit to a process of closing GTMO, I am confident that this legacy problem can be resolved, consistent with our commitment to the rule of law.
I know the politics are hard.  But history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to end it.  Imagine a future — 10 years from now or 20 years from now — when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not part of our country.  Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees who are being held on a hunger strike.  I’m willing to cut the young lady who interrupted me some slack because it’s worth being passionate about.  Is this who we are?  Is that something our Founders foresaw?  Is that the America we want to leave our children?  Our sense of justice is stronger than that.
We have prosecuted scores of terrorists in our courts.  That includes Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit; and Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square. It’s in a court of law that we will try Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of bombing the Boston Marathon.  Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, is, as we speak, serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison here in the United States.  In sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told him, “The way we treat you…is the measure of our own liberties.”
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  How about Abdulmutallab — locking up a 16-year-old — is that the way we treat a 16-year old?  (Inaudible) — can you take the drones out of the hands of the CIA?  Can you stop the signature strikes killing people on the basis of suspicious activities?
MR. OBAMA:  We’re addressing that, ma’am.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  — thousands of Muslims that got killed — will you compensate the innocent families — that will make us safer here at home.  I love my country.  I love (inaudible) —
MR. OBAMA:  I think that — and I’m going off script, as you might expect here.  (Laughter and applause.)  The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to.  (Applause.)  Obviously, I do not agree with much of what she said, and obviously she wasn’t listening to me in much of what I said.  But these are tough issues, and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong.
When that judge sentenced Mr. Reid, the shoe bomber, he went on to point to the American flag that flew in the courtroom.  “That flag,” he said, “will fly there long after this is all forgotten.  That flag still stands for freedom.”
So, America, we’ve faced down dangers far greater than al Qaeda.  By staying true to the values of our founding, and by using our constitutional compass, we have overcome slavery and Civil War and fascism and communism.  In just these last few years as President, I’ve watched the American people bounce back from painful recession, mass shootings, natural disasters like the recent tornados that devastated Oklahoma.  These events were heartbreaking; they shook our communities to the core.  But because of the resilience of the American people, these events could not come close to breaking us.
I think of Lauren Manning, the 9/11 survivor who had severe burns over 80 percent of her body, who said, “That’s my reality. I put a Band-Aid on it, literally, and I move on.”
I think of the New Yorkers who filled Times Square the day after an attempted car bomb as if nothing had happened.
I think of the proud Pakistani parents who, after their daughter was invited to the White House, wrote to us, “We have raised an American Muslim daughter to dream big and never give up because it does pay off.”
I think of all the wounded warriors rebuilding their lives, and helping other vets to find jobs.
I think of the runner planning to do the 2014 Boston Marathon, who said, “Next year, you’re going to have more people than ever.  Determination is not something to be messed with.”
That’s who the American people are — determined, and not to be messed with.  And now we need a strategy and a politics that reflects this resilient spirit.
Our victory against terrorism won’t be measured in a surrender ceremony at a battleship, or a statue being pulled to the ground.  Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school; immigrants coming to our shores; fans taking in a ballgame; a veteran starting a business; a bustling city street; a citizen shouting her concerns at a President.   
The quiet determination; that strength of character and bond of fellowship; that refutation of fear — that is both our sword and our shield.  And long after the current messengers of hate have faded from the world’s memory, alongside the brutal despots, and deranged madmen, and ruthless demagogues who litter history  — the flag of the United States will still wave from small-town cemeteries to national monuments, to distant outposts abroad.  And that flag will still stand for freedom.
Thank you very, everybody.  God bless you.  May God bless the United States of America.
