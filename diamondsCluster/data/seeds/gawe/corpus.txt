	Everything is not enough
      	And nothing is too much to bear
	Where you been is good and gone
	 All you keep is the getting there
     —Townes van Zandt, “To Live’s to Fly”

We would come out of the floodgates and my dad would say, ‘Head for the lemon trees!’[...] The older folks always discouraged us from going, out of respect. The legend goes that you were always to bring some kind of sacrifice. So, somebody left some lemons for the ancestors. […] But now that it’s washing away […] it needs to be seen before it gets lost. 
—Richie Blink from “Louisiana’s Disappearing Coast Takes Ancient History With It.” 89.9, WWNO. New Orleans Public Radio 	
It’s easy to imagine
                    	              Richie Blink 
                    	               on the radio

unblinking
                 when he cants       opening words           	    
       	
      like floodgates
       	or my dad.
And when he says         say
then lemon trees                	     something
 
as simple as            going     	    really goes.
 
It’s even easier to conjure
the young ones              squinting at the sun 
                  
               soliciting spirits alive in the blood
                               the old folk left
 
when he says                       respect
or sacrifice.
 
But when legend                slips out
of his mouth
 
it sounds like ancestor             like washed
away           	        	                   like lost.
 
I say  	    selfishly     before the final island 	 
disappears
           	                 let’s tell a story—
every story of home—
that lives in the static on every station.
Let’s get away                     with everything
while we’re still slow	           in the process
of disappearing.
  
Let’s head for the lemon trees             pluck
the fruit pluck yesterday         
       pluck
ancient history	      pluck     today.
 
     	 In that distance the past glistens—
 	      a floating house shaping
                      	                      its own shore
 
the way an opened letter               
tucked in a drawer in a previous life	
                       	         wants another tongue.
Yesterday's splintered limbs say
don't let this be the last memory of me
                                   head for the trees
                  	           make an offering.
   	If the waves lap at the door    
                                                 let us swim.	
If the sky is never finished
 
         	                nothing is.
Time Travel
 
Two hours to the mountains, four to the sea. 
That’s what people who knew North Carolina kept saying 
about Greensboro. The move from New Orleans 
was a number of hours hard to recall. 
For a haul that long you can’t count time but space—
hours replaced with miles. Around 800, give or take.
It was a hotel halfway, just past Atlanta. A 15ft U-Haul 
with hatchback in tow. It was walkie-talkies—
a finger on talk. It was worry 
for the woman and kid out in front 
barely cresting every hill in our dying Nissan. 
I never let them escape my sight, my square of windshield 
like a rented world, but they always felt far away. 
Maybe moving anywhere would feel far away 
after 12 years in Louisiana; after Mardi Gras 
masquerading as rain and wind; after king cakes,
sin, and saints splayed on every table; 
after the birth of a kid, a near divorce—what people call
beginning again. 
On the road I remembered how, in grad school 
in Baton Rouge, when I’d go home to Arkansas 
it was always as they say: everything seemed small. 
But smaller than that—like I could never go back. 
Because the moment I left the place it had already gone— 
disappeared into dream. I knew then 
I’d surrender sleep to remember waking. 
Now we’re waking up in Greensboro. We had to get used
to the hour difference, but that didn’t take long.
We’re looking forward to the mountains. 
And when we’re ready for the four-hour trek 
to walk along the beach—all our exhausted ghosts in tow
pretending to be innocent shadows.

This Morning
Even the porch swing was a ghost. 
Touched perhaps by a light 
current of wind sweeping down 
from the foothills—
common here in late summer— 
but also as if it was still 
telling the story of the night before,
trying to find the right words 
to finish a last sentence.
He came outside and found himself 
there in the little square 
of sun splashed on the brick wall
just beyond the swing—
the mess of his hair
the shadow of a familiar monster.
It felt something like a dream— 
like he was there 
and not there. Like a part of him 
had driven out to the coast 
the night before,
set out in a solitary dingy
to brave rocking waves and never
made it back.
And another part stayed put 
on the porch, spent the entire night
watching the swing sway.
By the time he saw the swing
he’d already decided 
waking is like being dead 
if the house and other inhabitants
except the cats cooing for food
are still tucked away.
But then a little girl appeared
at the door, her sleepy face pressed 
against the glass, her hair
a mess like his, and her mother
behind her (coffee in hand 
a ready weapon), eager to deliver 
last night’s dream.
She’d gone back, she said, 
yet again to her grandfather’s house,  
to carve out the valuables 
from the ghosts that own them—
place them gently into living hands.
So she walked to the garage, 
she said, brought back 
two rubber alligators and folded 
them into lassos—swung wildly 
in the air, which whipped.
He understood the desire to perform 
such a gesture, rather 
than finish any sentence 
and wake forever from that dream.  
some mornings 
I dress in my metaphorical 
                                           leathers
leash the muse 
drag her out 
from her slumberous house
throw her on the back of the bike
try to show her a good time
although 
most mornings 
I commute 
to campus
sweating in my synthetic jacket
all terminatored out 
to face the battle of the workday
I can’t find a line
think of no metaphor
or alliterative phrase 
but I don’t die	             make love 
to the pavement
so rough I never rise 
I make it home
walk and feed the hound
then myself 
it’s much simpler 
to get away with everything
when getting away
with mere nothing 
           is no cinch
Nightlight
 
A little moon (mentioned 
above) glows in our bathroom—
plugged into a wall socket
below two holes patched with putty
where apparently a towel rack
once hung, which would make three
towel racks in one bathroom.
The single mother and daughter 
who lived here before us were okay 
with two towel racks, I guess.
But what I really want 
to talk about is a magic trail 
of rainbow water—a pretend image 
I just heard Finn mention 
to her mother when I finished using 
the bathroom and came out here 
to write this down. 
But rather than write about 
any of that, I sit in a rickety seat 
passed down from parents 
and listen to night pronounce 
its droning arrival in a long drawl 
that disappears the light.
I blow smoke through purple petals 
drooping on the oxalis our new 
neighbors gifted. I flick ashes until 
they clump on the webs 
North Carolina spider mites weave;
mites hungry enough to gray 
every leaf in Greensboro.
At the very least the bush below 
the stone ledge that divides 
our front porch from the world—
a bush I cannot name. I dare not try.
We just moved here, after all.
I’m still trying to pretend I know
the difference between  
the drowning of light and magic 
trails of rainbow water. 
porch sharks 
your lives leap from your lines     spring
from staying put 
            
on a porch          junky
                           littered like a beatnik’s
                           all scags & mugs
which would make me
feel at home in greensboro
bc let's face it          we fled
I’ll jam the butt 
of any inquiry
in an improvised ashtray
maybe a cloudy piece 
of tupperware left out for a few days 
to feed another likely stray
like it fed me many times before
even vagrants 
can stay put too many years 
—louisiana-permanence   (haha, as if)—
grasping for everything 
                                      that slithered 
                                                             further away
                                                         
than the magic    hand of chance medley
staying put
is a subtle mindfuck 
to master
inside the self        outside      ever ever land 
there's a shipwrecked son
searching the wake endlessly
for shark teeth singing
Any Poem about Any River
You always damn up 
my sharks—
lose them or loose them 
in the nearest battleship-shaped 
river 
      or any poem 
      about any river.
I realize now maybe for the first 
time maybe the fiftieth 
you have always attempted  
(somewhere on this map we have
       re-made
      again and again 
though cannot name) 
to allow me a more pleasant 
                                    swim—
the exception is always.
Sharing the same map        
we have to make a home 
in the legend
      because we had to stop
staying put on the porch.
Just today Sarah and I traveled 
toward a cat 
an hour away in Raleigh 
dying of cancer 
just to talk options with his doc.
The map app voiced 
its list of indiscriminate 
                               sentences
at a low volume 
on Sarah’s phone. 
It couldn’t get us jack
without catching
every light
      easy as Eric
      before and after
      his dark bout
      with booze.
And to avoid            every toll
we had to listen
to Brett Kavanaugh’s opening 
statements
                 just for 
                 a distraction.
I wish I could say otherwise 
but sometimes 
the light holding us is made 
                                   of teeth.
 
        Sometimes stars 
         are sharks         lost 
in any river crossed.
sometimes stars are sharks
most times actually—
a ball of burning fangs
they have to move to breathe
twinkle twice razor rows of teeth
swim to grieve 
or to bring grief
at the speed of light
really the speed
of death too
if u think as fast as u feel about it
both constants
we urchin behind
with our little human spines
and bottom-feeding 
mouths fossilizing doubt 
begetting 
all these fragile everythings
and sometimes sharks are stars
just as gravity’s an aardvark
and mortal tolls 
are the only boundaries
for a school of
stellar predators
migrating across sky charts 
five dorsal fins 
circling dust
I. A PILGRIMAGE TO THE FOUNTAIN OF NOTHING
precarious nothings
I made 				       a pilgrimage 
to the fountain of nothing
wanted to find the source
of all pointlessness
                      unsurprisingly
there was no alter of offerings
nor stone engraving
indicating the spring
silent even hidden in grey
foliage or clouds unclear
to me now even before it	        still unsure 
my response
whether to leap in
splay out my everything
precious    crumbled in a paper sack 
or possibly to cork it
                       but my martyr drive
has never been a particularly
strong one    always an acorn
on concrete next to the vivid
spectrum of my hedonism 
      
                 which I admit may be shrinking
whether from a slight change
of perspective connected to perseverance
or just the nature of the pendulum 
even at this precipice
of the sublime void   even eating a popsicle
favored or flavored by existentialists
there's certainly no spot
for a hammock and my bladder
                  is full 
                  of sierra nevada
      
I open a book
ferlinghetti 
and I dance swaying                        like a drunk
on the subway
refusing to touch the handrails
     
                         and consume
the pages madly flipping 
to the next to the next
vaulting from word to word
an acupuncture 
of mind and body
as if the book
unlike this 
seemingly innocuous 
wellspring 	                             will never end
Lately
I often wonder if we live
in one of five or six
postcards Brett has sent since 
we moved from New Orleans.
I wonder if that kind of living is 
the same as inhabiting 
windows walked by on the way
to the bodega, say
the one I used to walk to 
almost daily for beer or butter. 
Maybe an onion or avocado.
In Greensboro we walk
to the park two blocks. Pause 
on the little bridge over 
the little creek to watch or feed
the little ducks.
When we’re hungry we drive 
to the closest store we can find.
New Orleans to here I can’t
imagine all the bridges 
crossed or the rivers their long
frowns stretch always over.
Every one of them is still stuck 
somewhere. Wild as a dream 
in the Nissan’s rearview mirror.
We had to sell that car.
Now, here, we live in wonder
of what we left behind
and what we wait to come 
in the mail or otherwise the sky.
air mail 
why do we always lie 
about the sky
heavenly heavens to betsy
stealth bombers
drones, storks
9/11, santa claus
chemtrails, aliens
earhart, jesus
icarus, wright
lord of the call button
firsts in fastening
I think of paper planes
dreamcatchers 
wind chimes
whooping cranes
a flock of kamikazes
hear flight of the valkyries
when pigs have flown
to protect us
they have that right
pilots are actually really smart
some of my boyhood’s
favorite heroes
(replaced by joysticks)
many a young american 
idolizes—breast pinned with wings—
still my favorite
of the people
that follow orders
and drop disorder
I always wanted to
start a company of 
dishwasher safe sex toys
and attachments
and use the profits
to bomb fundamentalist 
countries christian and muslim
with said sex toys
so I guess I’m a terrorist 
or maybe just another dreamer
with the reflection of horizon on my visor
mach 3 at altitude 
it's how we fast forward
from history
in escape pods
pushing the envelope 
licking 
our love letters to the past
            
              out there in the ether
the only color to be seen
earthly blues—
a dim faded denim
delivering a fleshy peek
of cheek walked past
with wink caught you 
looking back in space
getaway cars
      i.
      
I can only remember
half of what I remember
           every getaway chase
(who was your girl in the chase 
again?)
sometimes it was a simple walk
away like at the mall stealing
cards, cds, or video games
sometimes a running vw bus
in idaho after nabbing hubcaps
or high hats for my new best friend 
sometimes running through moonlit
fields in the jungle 
machine guns 
and dogs in the near distance
one blast mistakable for a car backfiring
is never as scary as rapid fire
whisper-opera zipping past 
once at 14     I went to the projects
to buy forty dollars of weed
with my friend billy
who could drive
that was my first 9mm to the head
I mostly remember the red synthetic interior
of billy’s pontiac, the depth down the barrel
eye-to-chamber and our tutor
of hard knock’s protruding bottom lip
like a hippopotamus on the nature channel
luckily we were oxpeckers   parasites
allowed to live inside              his lips 
ajar so I went home and cut the lawn
sculpting the only grass I got that day
into undulating patterns bloodlessly 
self-propelling away thanking god in shock
the first time I walked into an american dispensary 
I thought this was the way it was always meant to be
always could have been 
simple like a candy store
not even as tricky as an alcohol run
but then how would you ever harm
how would you ever earn       or enslave?
bc every getaway leads to another getaway
I’ve got more than I’ve got fingers and toes
I’ve got some un-getaways too
some nights in the drunk tank
some nights in worse
it's the everything really
that I remember  	   the whole 
feeling of mortal wonder
one either forgets or strives to— 
a luna moth that resumes
after its eyed wings are pawed
by human hand after hand
bc my illicit activities pale
in comparison to the number of times
I've avoided dying in a car or plane
or climbing cliffs
by the sea in darkness 
even the many times
I entertained finally not letting myself get away 
any longer 
it all inspires a little fear
(like watching my very own failed murderer of myself movie)
now my conscious mind gravitates to longevity  
but even now I honestly can't say I still don't cull that feeling 
bc there's nothing more freeing
than being alone    opening up the throttle 
on my motorcycle until the oncoming white lines become one
with death in the distance     blurring
the world
and getting away—	
      ii.
a raindrop get away
with everything down
the window pane
gravity more of a “nothing-
gets-away-without”
kinda deal
I just had a dream
that got away from me
like spilled grapes (ain’t blue dude)
something about squirting picante
on a meatball sub passing back
and forth eating bites like russian roulette 
and I kept dropping my wallet
everywhere I went
there was a feeling of chagrin 
after I challenged a native american
to a swim and then I knew I had to collect
the wallet from a dirty pool drain
with a suction urchin of hairs and debris
a lucid dream is always special—
reflexive moment urging 
our fuck or flight instincts 
let the wild nighttime rodeo 
commence with no cowboys
let the bewildering wildebeests roam
be it a traffic jam or stampede of dinosaurs 
of course sleep often gets away from me
on the whole
just like its quick-limed memories
             (upon the waking shit I gotta do today)
more evenings than I support
but it's not a sham
it's a kiln for more getaway capers
blue as delft porcelain 
	iii.
blame everything
get away with
the width of the margins
we sneak into
or are imprisoned in
waiting for our monopoly man
to bail us out
our phony jabroni
our lotto line homies
the die the free parking
the bail that is my savings account
the atm in orleans parish prison
that’s always broken yet
sheriff sends each visitor 
in the drunk tank to it
the gray glimmer of an instance of hope
cheapskates on that paper chase
the jerk-off jackpot
the ganjapreneurs
and all their apprentices
the rainy day roll
the oiled dump funds
four for foes
for profit prisons
it’s all slathered 
like shit on a wall
next to your bunk
or your throne
metal or marble
tincture or ton
this con has conned 
done been-around
magic slurs
ya heard
bet I know where you got

Chthonic Sheet of Ice (Slip Away from Everything)
A woman washes 
          dishes in 
          an underworld.
In another 
                 she flowers         
                    her glare.
Shimmers two	            glowering eyes
dull against the winter
night beyond        the kitchen window.
There her face is gripped
by its shabby glass. 	                 This
too is an incarceration. Another
was the day she handed my infancy 
over to Memphis January—
the coldest winter on record.
That’s what she said anyway.
                                    When memory
of us curled up curled up
inside her like a story that tells
a story about a story.
In one story an image of     my mother 
washes dish after dish as       I sharpen
my eyes behind her back
cutting its shape into 	           my story
which is as kind as
             any underworld
      
      can be. Still—a kind 
      of incarceration.     
chronic chthonic disorder 
I take it on the lam with charon 
crypsis on the river styx
loose lips sink 			   dinghies
lord knows that's always
been my achilles                              spiel 
gagged with a bribe
this gold holds frost 
as well as the darkness 	        of depths
can't lay lower than the underworld
an old soul in the oldest hole
where telling is the only escape from toiling
prisoners always got something to say
just wait even silent ones out
we all get here the same way
passion and a lack of control
a lengthy stroll downriver
searching for what we lost
past the past  		          past the marsh
swallowing each step 
with more muddy hunger
our crab traps are broken
so you pull up the neighbors’
when they’re not looking
who wants the claws
when you can eat the tails in hell?
it's the smell really that brings me back
and the hordes of people filing    filling 
their flesh with voids       last pleasures  
more a sight for sucking everything in
than even a fish market
or a race track
more viral than alive
a katabasis clap back
the most gruesome of getaways
it’s a wish awash 
a virtual burial rite
for those that don't ever want to see
past the night 
Past the Night
The broken basketball goal
ditched out back by the last tenants
lends its rust to the chain-link fence
it leans against, which divides
our backyard from the neighbors—
four college kids who party
late every Tuesday and Thursday
as if penciled in on a schedule
that’s taped below the bar
at the local dive down the street
where they all seem to work.
 
It’s hard to stay angry with them.
We were wild like them and not
that long ago, but we moved to this
neighborhood, with its three-
story UNCG professor homes, its 
fancy park, thinking surely 
the kids were drinking elsewhere.
 
We like to drink, too, but usually
on the front porch—what 
we’re used to after having lived 
so long in New Orleans, where only 
the rich or lucky have backyards
big enough to sit around and sip.
 
Sitting on the front porch, the sound
of our aging shame can’t travel
downhill straight through a baby’s
bedroom window. And we can’t play
ping-pong like the kids next door
because we don’t have a table or 
loud friends. We left them behind
stuck in an old song.
 
We have this rusted basketball goal
which is silent except the sound 
of dead leaves scratching through 
the pink hoop and behind 
the backboard. We score every lie 
we tell ourselves about its past
every time we see it lay in its waste.
 
I guess it’s hard to curb something
like a broken basketball goal
when you move out. It’s not a couch
which we curbed on Joliet and again 
on Gayoso, moving from house
to house when we were priced out
of entire school districts. But 
that, too, is a lie—a bit of a stretcher 
as Mark Twain might’ve said.
 
But when we moved to Greensboro
we were told—one of the first
things—everything has to be in a bin.
Won’t get picked up otherwise.
 
So the basketball goal remains
a home for dead leaves or a lookout
for the occasional squirrel
scanning the terrible sky for wings.
And every time I come out
to our new backyard, which is big
for us, to rake up the leaves,
the broken goal is there prompting
me to lie—to say that once
it belonged to a little girl not unlike
our five-year-old daughter Finn, 
named after Twain’s attempt 
to rewrite a false truth—but maybe
 
this girl was a bit older, and she
got away with everything once upon
a time, but by the time getting away
with everything was already
a story she was beginning to tell
herself, the goal was already
on its side and beginning to brown
like the leaves that pile around it.
 
The leaves. That’s why I’m here—
to rake again. But now I see a quarter
tails up among the elm’s dead
which makes me wonder if good luck 
belongs to pennies alone.
 
I rake it into the pile—watch it glint
at the top like an ornament
for a foul cake cooked in hell. But I 
feel heavenly enough to quit working—
bend down to put it in my pocket—
return it again to the darkness 
it fell from. Maybe later I can magic 
a silver dream from Finn’s ear. 
swallowing spit
man if I had a nickel 
for every time I didn't		                           evade
raking the leaves
a dime for all the times
I’ve dreamed                                           to be extinct 
a susan b for all the wednesdays 
I stayed up all night like your neighbors
man if we still had the quarter (as in vieux carré)…  
we’d be sippin coffee, beer, 	                           or tea
—no difference to me—on a balcony 
showing our faces to the storm
recounting all the getaways we’ve
aged with minor disgrace, a form of dignity 
for former reprobates with silver keg 
chests bare except tattoos and hair
with concrete consciences which 
the roots of our families wiggle thru and      displace
to form the only topography found
on these streets where the sidewalk bursts
begins ends and begins again every step
a getaway trip     I recall a story
my friend louis running from the cops
and his stinky chef clogs flying off
like rabid bats in the dark
before the block itself easily apprehended         him
what a scene     he was so drunk he went home
to his apartment two apartments ago
pounded furiously on the door screaming for
g-money—another cook and friend as well as 
his roommate several roommates ago—to let him in
I washed dishes at a pizza joint on magazine 
with a kid with a real similar story
except he let himself into the wrong home
then curled up on the couch
passed out    after the mother shouted and called
the cops to get him out      she felt so bad 
she eventually bailed him out
bc he was so broke he had to do a 56-day stint
in OPP and this was post-katrina          shortly after
so no telling the things that kid seen     I did 3 days 
and cried my eyes out the moment I was released
the most absolute hell I’ve ever been subjected to
I still remember getting the last sip of backwash from 
the one shared cup of water we got over the entire 
duration
                                           of course I swallowed it     
On the Morning of My 37th Birthday
I spill from a dream           somewhere
between rested                  and wrested.
 In which an ancient woman    quivers 
 two whispery brooms back 
                         and forth—
handle-end to bristle-end—
             in the oozy dark until my body 
                            is gone. 
Where its shape had stood            there 
is only 	more night.             The process 
is slow.
But my ghost flies     city      to country 
so fast I lose track                      of how. 
Through the bedroom window I hear
shivers of wind rattle dead cans.
                                      Maybe the rain 
hasn’t stopped slanting Thursday’s sky 
into Saturday. 
                                  I check my phone
for the weather—              see a familiar 
sham sun—        imagine the actual star
glad to be a white dot ensconced  
on its shelf 			 of cloud 
ready to rip the morning            apart—
a desperate pink.
Facebook tries to sell me a shirt
Every Capricorn Should Own. 
                  Its cotton sleeves make long 
                  promises 
to keep me warm; every stitch 
choked—   uplifting words about being 
born in January;       five different fonts
yawning blue and maroon. 
My mother sends a text—	   all caps. 
After her obligatory sentence 
three question marks               curl black 
inside three black boxes—  replacement 
for emojis refusing                 translation. 
  
I don’t mind.       I wonder 
why we place                           the image 
after the word.     I wonder 
what balloons      cakes          or confetti?
                      
Yesterday’s clothes               are wadded 
on the floor beside the bed 
like a dead animal.               I put myself 
through their holes                     advance 
in a clash                  of tremors 
toward the kitchen                   for coffee.
 
On the table                       six blue tulips 
Finn picked 
for my birthday.               Later                 
both knowing their scent 
is wasted on us                 non-pollinators 
we’ll take turns directing our inattention 
to the ripe reward              they signal for.
I’ll imagine her           five-year-old hand
suspended                      in invisible wind 
like a monstrously 
misshapen swarm              on a long walk 
to steal flowers                  from the edges 
of neighbors’ lawns.
Now in the absence of bees      my phone 
buzzes in my pocket.                 My sister 
sends a gif 
equipped with lit candle           pointy hat 
whiskery cat-face sassy gray.
I produce a dim smile           for no one— 
tantamount to the kitchen’s dying bulb; 
table the phone next to the laptop; 
remember I haven’t                       spoken 
to Vince in two months.  
        I’ve heard 
                             from his brother 
about a girlfriend—         Greek Professor 
or       Professor of Greek? 
                         To hunt down news of her 
                                                I try to read 
his last poem                              sprawling 
so many storied arms like            so many 
ghostly tentacles.      
                     I’m distracted—
because the blur of octopus I saw 
a few days ago	              with Finn 
at the Science Center                    focuses 
behind my eyes             every ten minutes.
It reminds me—then    and now—of what 
Vince said once at Chelsea’s Bar
in Baton Rouge—  
that he’d eaten octopus before but 
probably wouldn’t do it again.          Hard 
to eat something with so much          heart.
I close the laptop                               open 
the blinds to have a look before     the sun 
cracks 
open the morning                          spilling 
its judgments 
hurrying the traffic        to work.
On our front lawn          two crape myrtles 
wear the dark                  like a heavy coat. 
The ends of their branches     
                                                have spread 
themselves too thin. 
                                I am still here 
to sweep the mess of fallen petals; 
I am still here to compare    bare branches 
to a dream of brooms;          I am still here 
to write all this down;                 I am still 
slow in the process 
                                           of disappearing.

my ghost flew from city to country
yesterday it was so foggy
walking home from the library
I couldn’t see the new church’s tower
just the smaller two twin steeples  
and there was a confidence in knowing
there’s something so large looming invisibly 
the cathedral’s ghost I believed in more than
any greater significance of church 
I have yet to climb that tower
unseen and filling this traveler
with an irregular flight of faith
on this particular evening pass
too windy every time I’ve tried
and even though you can’t smell them 
anymore or visit the crypt 
you can read an eyeful inside
about how the hollows
are packed with royal bones 
delft—a painter’s town 
of two church towers
one old and one new 
and the resting place until this day
—or opaque evening to be precise—
for the house of orange 
where the assassination of william 
by a fanatic catholic was the first 
assassination with a handgun 
in history combined with the fact
the spanish had sacked breda
predecessor home of royal bones
so here he stayed 
away from greater cities 
hosting greater ghosts 
and I think about my own 
little disappearing act 
from everything 
how the fog welcomes 
only what is in front of it
a lesson particularly 
useful for apparitions 
sweeping et al. 
under the proverbial table
my leather pants
—the ones from spain
I’d lost my virginity in—
got away
from me in the 11th grade
my buddy pete 
that sonofabitch 
—who just like a rich kid 
never offered to pay—
borrowed them for prom
and I never saw them again
—not without implication
I did take off on a pink camel
bloody his nose with my knee
doing a deer spirits-fueled antler dive
off a pool chair he held
actually I loved his mom very much
and not just because she bought 
some knives from me 
the summer I pretended to work
before my first break for paris 
often I’d stroll into her house 
—in idaho no one knocks or locks—
to converse with her just
as often as I’d go to see pete
essentially we lived 
on the same street
she was always happy
to see me—
which was rare for parents 
in those days especially  
she’d greet me loudly
exuding a sanguine glow
and her whole-noted hoot
that sounded like a sailor
who’d just heard a doozy
followed up with a slightly 
more feminine snicker 
then she’d resume raking her carpet
—can of oil in the periphery that 
paced her throughout her chores—
ever-inquiring about the how of me
and, not explicitly, craving a tinge
of the trouble I was up to 
as she’d go back and forth
we’d go back and forth
like stuck buddies do 
my favorite is when I’d find
her in the chilly garage
next to pete’s dad’s harley
and the fridge full of aluminum 
she never offered me 
—she probably knew
I was usually a little lit too
escaping
the commandments
of my parents—
she’d reminisce
about her annual rides
to sturgis 
sure you could hear
her giddy even over
a hog’s resounding
combustion
of the getaway fantasy 
companionship
so often needed when sharing 
a broom 
chess pieces untidily scattered
one rarely liberates themselves from the burdens of birth 
the temerity of family
the boredom and belligerence we show
who we love most
we police most
pull tails      make squeal
like torturing daddy long legs
or stuffing m80s in frogs 
the cruelty and ignorance 
we are capable of before we are fully molded 
into a tundra of persona
which the gods taught us
and a consolidated god robbed us
of our piece of the crab apple pie
out of the trivial pursuit of passions
our colonoscopy of ontology 
old poisons grow evermore poisonous 
and the contagions of connection
or correction bestowed upon us brethren 
resist the timorous 
swallow the backwash
all tainted pail and well
our flashback backfired
before all stumbling aftermath—
howbeit don’t lie down your king just yet
okay, boomer
watching all the old boomers get away
with doing nothing at all their meetings
the audible and edible consternation
of the faculty of the administration 
of the people getting everything
we usually just want to get away from
yet to many I have become one
maybe even to myself 
society is sick of watching the elite and their getaways
all except one so maybe they aren’t as sick
as me bc their man is nothing but a finger
up their butt with some arsenic on top
the grocery list scrolls down endlessly 
all my outsider sentiment conflicts with
all my hetero cis whiteness
and the unanswered abjections
society wages against realer others
than myself are loftier than any thought
yet all our promises to ourselves
more often than not are
the things we have no choice
is it wrong to derive some joy
splitting the see-you-in-hells
is it wrong for moses to rejoice 
between conjoined tidal waves
overhead their break impending 
II. CHURN THE EARTH
Jack’s Ashes
        	I.
We keep them cached 
in a box. Its shade 
of brown often only a color
faux wood can claim. 
Its size and shape 
tantamount to discounted 
soap, two bars packed 
and sold together—
about as heavy as that.
The entertainment center
it sits on was passed
down from my grandfather
when I was seven—
a long time before he died
and a much longer time 
before I met Sarah,
my wife, and Jack, her cat. 
Jack was Siamese—at least 
part. The black M 
crested on his forehead 
suggested something else—
Maine Coon maybe—
but we never really knew.
As for the heirloom, 
Grandpa said cherry wood.
Who can really tell 
what anything is made of 
if it wanders in on all fours—
abandoned warehouse 
to abandoned world— 
or is handed down 
from a failure of memory
to tell history’s lies
until it finds a new wall 
to rest against.
The entertainment center—
its awkward wobbly 
frame—weighs the same
as 500 boxes of ashes. 
All the size of discounted 
soap—two bars packed 
and sold together;
this is one lie I could tell.
And if I was asked to tell 
how many times 
I’ve hauled it from house 
to house, I think
I’d describe the dying 
legs it stands on instead 
but only as things 
that grow closer to claws 
with every move.
        	II.
 
I remember wanting
to help haul Grandpa’s box
to its muddy hole.
I remember it felt wrong
the job was given
to his brothers alone.
 
I had to stand by watching
the rain churn the earth.
 
        	III.
 
I’d thought Sarah wanted 
to scatter Jack’s ashes
but she must’ve decided
against it, because there’s
no way to open the box.
 
It was Sarah who Googled
Greensboro pet burial.
She went with Precious
Memories—the sixth hit just
below Dead Animal Pickup.
 
        	IV.
 
My grandfather’s body
never would’ve been
burned to ash. It’s just not
what my family does.
We’re delivered
to the dirt cold and whole—
too stiff to change
the shape of death for us
still standing graveside
holding our breath.  
 
When we die we’re stilled
by the absence of will.
Gone too soon
to stop pretending 
we live forever—
never a grave slip
of signed paper to get 
to the desk. There is little 
to leave either way. 
        	V.
 
Jack left us a shadow
slinking along baseboards—
memory striped with fur
his long body blinked 
easily away.
 
Grandpa left little behind
save the gravelly sound
of his voice caught on a VHS—
a family video of his 25th
wedding anniversary.
 
It’s hard now to recall
the words those sounds
propped up, but I like
to remind myself that
the tape still exists
somewhere—it must.
 
        	VI.
 
We said Jack was part
Maine Coon. It wasn’t
necessarily a lie.
Saying so just made life
a lighter defeat.
Grandpa said cherry wood
when he passed on
the entertainment center
like a shot in a movie 
most overlook.
        	VII.
 
The entertainment center—
it has no measurable mass.
We know 
only how heavy it feels
when we move from house
to house, when we hold it
close to our chests, when we
peel it from the floor
where its claws gripped.
 
        	VIII.
 
Jack never woke up
and our other cat started
peeing all over the floor.
Maybe she had been before.
Maybe it was the move.
Maybe it was because she knew
Jack was dying before her.
 
She’s better now, but now
we might move again.
Sarah says she’s applying
to a new opening
at a school three hours
into the mountains.
I imagine the scratches
that will be left on the floor
from those legs
clawing their initials
into the wood.
 
         	IX.
 
This morning I remain
unimaginative
concerning the question
of everything— 
of whether or not
to be burned or buried
or whether it’s better
to say grandpa or
grandfather 
         —all I know
 
is to hear his voice
we have to stay asleep. 
alt burial rites
I too have been envious
of the pallbearers
                        excluded 
(probably for my youth
or smaller stature) 
from the last time
you have to help
someone make 
a move
we two have been
brothers in dirt
waterlogging
our dreams
to make them even
heavier
chasing them
or the cat 
or the tail
often our own
to bury
our dead
the bones
or barbeque 
them into 
the biblical dust
we were promised
decisions 
w/o revisions
black holes
swallowing
white holes
no funerals
or wills
and infinite funerals 
and wills
in spacetime 
we get the distance
to solve everything
unable to reach our
alternate selves
we will long
for the burdens
of this shadow 
world we wait 
to be (like jack)
burned into
gonna set your flag on fire
 
big chef been calling me about wild man again
(one must wonder how many conversations
like this have gone on behind their back)
how he’s become unhinged
disappearing and reappearing	   wasted   missing work
threatening to murder movie producers
and his former partner 	best friend
enough to be the only one still talking
about an intervention
and what kind of friend or flag boy
am I when I talk him out of it
say that our wild man’s
too far gone	living on stolen time
which is the greater crime
to care or not care
to let or try to stop him
maybe call his dad or mental health?
(even if it’s not for me now   I do believe
it’s everyone’s right to kill themselves
I’m sure people have accused me of the chore)
shit someone else probably
called the cops already
the big chef’s text read “jail or coffin”
and everyone that knows wild man
knows there are guns and a sports car 
idling near	 not to mention
camels coke beer weed shrooms xtc
lsd poppers speed and probably meth
in whatever shape form or quantity
they make it these days 	me being
not as initiated in such things anymore
besides the occasional concert
camping trip   excuseless debauchery   or mardi gras
(and hey I’ve got no problem
with drugs   myself or in society
even though people I love
have probably felt quite the opposite)
this caring requires careful planning
like a getaway		some tricky shit 
it’s so much more fun, easy, and desperate
to not give a fuck and that’s where our wild man’s at
and I been there believe me       but he’s settled there
—maybe longer than anyone I know—
to the point of martyrdom
and wasn’t judas the best disciple?
someone will believe jesus was a burner and lived in the quarter
he certainly loved the prostitutes altho now he has the scene
and fuck I do get a kick running into the kid
(I won’t lie sometimes he provides and I take)
at cosimo’s or the track and he’s shaking his ass
taking vivid pictures            passing a good time 
cracking us up shit faded ashy and falling as he may be
we’ve got real history and I love the joker even if I
yearn for a former version    one I really identified with
(a fellow car-wreck orphan    I respected his hustle and ambition
shit did this already get in the past tense?)
even so I don’t entirely fault him for his decisions
(he’s certainly evolved out of his southern prejudices)
it’s a fucked up world and he’s making it fun   fucking it back
I get that—fuck I do the same—even though I haven’t let go
to the same degree    in fact my grip has tightened
but does that mean I’m more or less enlightened?
it certainly doesn’t feel right when you let a friend get away
even if it’s to a body painted paradise of vice
don’t see his dealers or burner family 
come up with bail or a shot
of adrenaline when he needs it most
because there’s no extricating him from them or new orleans
nor can we longer enjoy the spectacle of friend-killing
so we guiltily chose distance and our own cold getaway
from a friend so long in need that it becomes greedy
neither of us are gonna bail him out next time
and none of us want to go to his funeral
I’m sure I’ve told him as much in between beers
maybe keybumps before bed
but this violence is what poisons our aid
running around with guns and threatening 
that’s where I gotta stay on the neutral ground
I’ve spent my time with nopd and la doc
in truth I’m trying to leave the whole damn country
not a felon and soon    so here you go wild man:
not even this poem can be your intervention
and I never felt like I was ever in a place myself to give one
considering I'll probably party next to you this very weekend
but to you my friend deep below the shell of sequins
and chemicals     from one brokenhearted motherless brother
to the other I say:    please    please prove this poem wrong
Too Dark to Tell
The sky is full
of black and screaming
 
—Bill Callahan, “Too Many Birds”
 
Just before my mother called 
to deliver the difficult news 
that my brother attempted to take 
                                          his own life 
            I snapped a pic 
of the biggest owl I’ve seen so far 
                                 in North Carolina. 
Its shadowy bulk flew from rooftop 
to crape myrtle 
and I saw the lawn for the first time 
      
                            with wild eyes.
The feathery predator perched—  
its pinions folded on a bare branch— 
               prepared to take 
the life of the stray calico 
                slinking below. 
Not quite kitten and not quite cat
it was one of those that always looks 
adolescent. 
                       I hadn’t seen it before; 
                 the owl must’ve.
My mother called twice
                   knowing the first will go
straight to voicemail 
                           the second will ring.
It didn’t take long 
             for us both to stop talking—
             unable to unknot.
Where rope ends and sky begins 
was too dark to tell. 
                               I hung up. 
Deleted the pic—too dark to tell 
      owl from tree.
Measurements
The sun too is given a size—numbers
for height and width?
        	      	          I don’t know if that’s right.
 
Though replace both with
a Shakespearean—or gothic—phrase
as in            	from crown to toe 
and you’ll approximate me    could if you cared
to look long enough.
 
See  	           here I am	 feet stretched out
back hunched
on porch steps
hiding the odd from the even 		         even
        	from my neighbor      who always
is smoking on her front porch      	      always 
on her phone.
 
Just across the thicket               where the rabbits
have made their warren  	  between
the shadows of our homes        darkening
the grass
 
she sits where she has sat                since the day
she lost her job.
 
Today I stayed home        	   took the day off.
 
A mental health day I told my boss and
the woman who haunts this house          with me
the woman who opened the curtains
like she does          	            to let in some sun
 
like she does
before she left       	 dropped our daughter off 
at school.
 
Two degrees earned and I         haven’t learned 
much because
even from this                               	  distance
                    	(also somehow
                    	  measurable)
we can attach numbers to define the diameter
                                                           of the sun
                          and I can’t even tell
the woman who haunts the house
after she’s gone   
(crumpled bedsheet discarded beside me dead)
to show the bright world her
painted face
        	  how cowardly I become only an hour
        	  after it rises—
 
won’t mention a thing about the blades
sharpening themselves inside my fattening
belly
or
the constant throb in my chest   	     that I
want it all to quit.
 
Still I sit holding smoke in my mouth—
still I won’t stop sitting          so long so often
on the porch
                    	         hiding from my neighbor
 
myself
and the sun.
 
Like one of those scared rabbits         its chest
thumping 150 beats per minute
 
I only come out of hiding
                                	     an hour before dark
the curtains not yet closed    	   but promised. 
IV. 	THIS NEVER-ENDING THEATER
everything possible
last night a young man my age
pleasant yellow hair and a pale face 
came to me at my work with curious pictures
of us together     yet apart      from distanced childhood
altho he wouldn’t introduce himself or state his claim
he promised all would be revealed when he came back again
my father was there too and took no notice
this stranger visited and left again with equal dubiousness and aplomb 
yet I confronted my father    forced him to assure me I had no estranged 
brother from secret infidelities    a bastard to haunt us  
in the third eye of evening he came again    this time with a homemade 
show-n-tell that in sentiment would have      made cornell proud
a small sculpture of toothpicks my mother used 
a fly collection from our small apple orchard in ny
little illegible scribbles all over    triggering suspicion in me 
(why a writer suspects the writing…)
a saran-wrapped yellow mangled shoebox of liquid and a few wires
a digital trigger he fumbles out of his pocket
not quick enough to curtail the assault I level on him
and fail to restrain to the point of pulping his head
albeit in a cartoon not gory way since everything is possible
in this poem
groping for consent
in the late 80s
even early 90s
sex education
had pbs and pamphlets
at the dept. of health
and pornography
was found in the woods
sold in black sleeves
seedy street clubs
hwy stops
or doled out in fractions
over dial up
the concern on the tip 
of every tongue
and titillation was hiv
a shared fear by gays
blacks               whites
(never any presidents)
prostitutes         even virgins
like me and all the other kids
that watched the movie kids 
back then the word consent 
wasn’t discussed 
with much hierarchy  
in the lexicon
one could presume
it was assumed
boys should be gentleman
when making out
and groping 
for permission 
to satisfy
instincts
to go as far 
as persuasion 
and a girl would let you
certainly stop 
when you heard 
the word no
but that was consent
either an implication
or a steadfast strikeout
and to be even 
more up front 
what adolescent 
boy amidst 
heavy petting
and getting handsy
as they used to say
isn’t flooring it
to get to his primitive 
goal of the promised 
land to lie with a woman
another  	  problem 
language exposes
consent’s not promised 
(except by myths of every hollywood
rom com, tv show, not to mention 
a pervasive promise of all advertising)
but bestowed 
and the folks in palo alto have yet 
to write a great regression  
for applying brakes
in the heat of the moment 
and why would they? 
because sex is capital
but now   and rightfully so
consent is a larger fraction 
of the dialogue
that’s something
to be proud of
yet the predator president 
flaunts how he evades a cage 
and professors and poets
cave to trigger warnings
outrage and self-censorship
Normal Stranger Ogling Octopus
 
I hear the prerecorded message
reach through a speaker hidden somewhere
in the ceiling above gate B-45
warning in a white-woman-radio voice
not to accept foreign objects from strangers.
 
I consider reaching toward the woman
to my left—to the tattooed octopus reaching
red tentacles down the side of her thigh.
 
      To offer the book
      I’m about to finish.
 
I tell myself it would be funny to do that.
Tats, nose ring, shaved sides of scalp—
all must mean she’s someone
who finds that kind of foolishness
just a little funny.
 
      Instead I check
      the time again.
 
Maybe she isn’t scared of the sudden
death of reading, and doesn’t need any help
to hold a laugh in the unmoving air.
Likely she is scared of any normal stranger
reaching an unprompted hand her way.
 
On the plane, she sits in front of me, texting
a loved one left behind or one
she’s on her way to see.
 
      I look away
          	to prove I’m good.
  
negative capability
hemingway’s heroes I am not 
a bridge dynamiter
in for whom the bell tolls
fighting fascists
for my father
but there’s some killer
deep in my dreams
sometimes he succeeds
in his war against me
sometimes I violate 
and reap revenge 
over 
and over     on him 
we are both           victims 
and perpetrators

Here Comes the Rain
 
Between the sea and the salt marsh
my in-laws’ bijou beach house squats on stilts
above a thicket of cordgrass
and bluestem, where for the last two nights
some critter, hidden from my phone’s
dim flashlight in the brush below the back deck
has made its noise toward the water.
 
It’s Mother’s Day. Sarah’s mom sits
on the deck, reading while she reclines
in a plastic Adirondack; Sarah, silent beside her
does the same—a book on women surrealists
held up awkwardly to block the sun.
 
The kid’s couched, gripped by the unflinching eye
of an iPad, so I step out to ask the mothers
if they’d prefer that I go to the closest grocery
for cinnamon and vanilla—I’d promised
to cook French toast. Appetite doesn’t demand it
Sarah says. Her mother’s nod agrees.
 
I point out a kettle of hawks sporting the blue
above a lone cormorant—the span
of its unfolded wings meant to intimidate
any predators. Sarah nudges past me,
grabs the binoculars that belong to the house.
 
When she’s finished she passes them to me
and returns to the tabled book. I fumble to adjust
the settings, scan the scar of land
jutting out from the marsh but can’t spot
the cormorant. Instead I find the American flag
at the edge of the neighbor’s deck.
 
Last night, after everyone had gone to bed
a strange shadow whipped
back and forth across the marsh. I didn’t know
right away what the black swath
belonged to, but when I attached shadow
to flag, I wished I had the drugs needed
to help me see it—to face or forget whatever it
might’ve meant. I mention this to Sarah—
make my noise toward the kitchen.
         	
At the oven I’m still holding the binoculars.
Dizzy from looking through their lenses
I stumble back to the deck—hand them over.
But before I head in I notice the sky
blurring a bit, swearing an oath to rainclouds
and remember that roar
we’d heard at the beach the last two days—
like the sky was shedding its skin.
 
We thought at first it had to be planes hidden
by clouds; a rumble of thunder.
But there were no clouds at all. I thought
of what Jack Kerouac said about the sea, which
I read on the little square of embroidery
decorating the toilet in the guest bathroom.
That it must be the roar of eternity.
 
I think now there must be a major insinuation
I’m missing—now, the moment
when the rain begins to come down.  
 roaring an oath to rainclouds
my binocs 
broke			                  before jack
like when we all fell outta love with neal 
after he dosed us the last time
we thought our lovers
were capable of             embroidering eternity 
finding surrealists in the sun
solving a generous family feud in the sand
or making			     our making 
princely pancake
without vanilla                            or cinnamon
neighbors                                    
without freighters 
feathers			  without a flag
                we weld the tunnel 
                while the gods sleep
all we need			is to need it all
grand slam
there are as many 
ziploc bags
as there are suns
I’ll go breaking anything
yes after a homerun
still steal second base
we sandbag our meat
rests to bleed
go ahead 
enjoy being led to the drought
throw your arms
in the trickle of river tonight
go ahead 
velcro our lips together
kindling the vows 
of a bonfire
nothing 
can take us over
not even infinity’s 
only moment	
missing booth inside your head
when time is ringing in my ears
I pick up
you & sarah calling 
from the national show
held shitty mic up
to speaker like the 90s
I couldn’t make
song thru all the satellite
but the blips and yelps
were all poetry and party
I suspect it may have been
“I’m afraid of everyone”
I’ve ever used
which is everyone
including you two
two of my besties 
imagining you both 
on a date in dc
makes me pleased
as the greek professor
not professor of greek
makes me a feast
consisting of so much feta
oil, olives, and oregano
sex &
tzatziki 
the real viagra
besides weed & wine
how many summer moves
have we moved and moved on
how we make a home 
how we make love
in our cells 
across our phones
the clichéd poem in a bottle (personally emptied)
cast into the brainy briny seas 
if we stay anywhere trouble will find us (inevitably)
if we’d stayed there (nola) we’d never leave
but in order—even if chances were entropy—to get away 
one must get away with (nothing and) everything
In the Wake of Chthonic Fires
 
The fragile chimera of a child’s laugh
skips across the hardwood, from living room 
to kitchen—aging secondhand sofa 
to dirty dishes—breaking a bit as it goes.
The broken parts roll to the corner baseboards 
where they collect in piles pretending to be old dolls 
tossed aside, stray markers with lost tops, 
moments of time when it was somewhat harder 
for laughing to happen. The part of the laugh 
that remains intact, having refused an afterlife 
that silence demands, makes its way to the woman
washing dishes, in which a creature is always 
cresting the dark caves of her blood, as if 
each morning the sun mounts the blue belly of sky 
the coldest night is gone for the first time—this 
is one part of her that is named Mother;
the part that hears the sound of laughing over water 
that woos hands to hurry; over hip podcast voices 
battling for a second to say something funny;
or a newscaster tongue, which moves like a monster
not because of how loud it speaks, or the tone—
because of the words it shapes. The mother, 
alone, hears the child’s laugh like a sentence said 
in a dream after waking—impossibly. 
And she won’t be stirred by disbelief. Just today 
her daughter asked if her face could be 
painted like a rainbow-cat; surely we all know 
the laugh that follows is a tangible fantasy.
lost tops
 
we've followed tangible fantasies
for at least an eternity 
intangible ones 
for how long?
I don’t write fuckin algorithms
I throw my soul 
on the floor
to be kicked 
around like
marker tops
all cylindrical
and hollow
all yellow 
and roll
I’ll take the finger 
my many    venial
               misdemeanors 
but whose lord 
gets charged for the felonies?
supposing 
it’s only omni-hardnosing
I’m syphoning 
exceptional fire:
water up the nose
that involuntary tingle
(just like fire and language)
is a gift from the gods
(lest we forget
even our captors
have captors)
Said the Night at Intermission
               It’s one of those days I never had
before the move.
I pour a cheap beer in a fancy glass 
wait at the antique table falling apart
	
                                                   in the kitchen 
while Sarah finishes Finn’s 
bedtime routine.
My ritual of reading having ended 
as it does 		  with a kiss
                                        I sit and try to recall 
the name of the tropical bird 
painted in fiery streaks across 
my fancy glass but never can.
In the oppressive     electric light of a kitchen 
at night 
      I elicit instead 
                                        a specific sashay 
                            of memory. 
Not recollected 
as if from a past life regression. 
More alive and well than that—more
 		                                 breathing 
                                                   now than then. 
As if the night itself has drilled into my skull—
an intermission
to make room—to glorify its own        
not-so-gruesome operation. And this memory 
springs dancing 	        from the burr hole  
like so:
 
There is a strange woman 	   in the kitchen.
She creeps like wild wallpaper      or a flicker 
of sun against its flowers        when a window 
of trees invites it in.
Floorboards creak beneath her boots 
as a stage for her sort of performance would.
In a moment I’ll flick a flake
of crusted skin from her forehead. 
She’ll frown. 	  	  For now she’s happy 
to stop changing clothes   every five minutes 
to walk a goofy walk.
And she won't stop—she can't until I believe 
in its beauty. It's easy to get 
distracted from couch and book      if you are 
an audience of one.
I give her the typical green-light-giggle 
we both need to hip-pivot past              
our own darkening eruptions—then she's off 
                        
               to find the perfect sweater- 
                      skirt combo.
In a moment 			  she'll be gone
to meet a friend—
      to booze through afternoon.
Sitting by the window     at Molly's Irish Pub 	 
         she’ll become something
            the sun shimmies by.
      
For now she’s happy to be a strange woman
creeping over the kitchen's creaky boards
as beautiful as wild as strange as light 
as flower as paper                as I am grateful.
        —And look now here she comes.
I pour a fancy beer in a cheap glass
always been one
for sacrament 
over ceremony 
(ceremony 
over sacrifice?)
of coffee mugs
over designer drugs
of moving through 
the house party
to the kitchen
and reaching into a new
patchwork cupboard
that awaits my selection of evening
the first morning I listened 
with my eyes I heard the screaming
of a spider on her web 
suctioned by the wind
like this glass I’m holding 
blown by machines
making minimum wage 
in mother russia
sold by ikea 
full of all the OW
—a cherry sour
found in a den in delft
boasting 700 beers—
I could afford 
as much as anyone feels
—the slick bourgeois cup they grasp in—
this unnecessary world is theirs 
as much as I prefer the next morning 
after 
        being up all night yard sale find
V. UNDESERVING OF FURTHER RESOLVE
Family Reunion at the Hunting Lodge
On Father’s Day, one father—
among many—is granted an hour 
or two to hide under a tree;
jot down his thoughts.
The bugs are too bad—or too many 
maybe—for him to stand 
the fuss of their unrelenting whispers; 
the occasional pang
of exposed ankle or calf.
And his few lines are likely to be
either impossibly pastoral
or undeserving of further resolve.
But he decides he’d like to try anyway; 
grabs his daughter’s clipboard, 
her new set of glittery pens 
and slick paper from the patio table
scattered with spent cans 
and abandoned bottles of water.
He creaks open the cooler and pockets
two beers; drags his father-in-law’s
red camping chair—
the one with two cup holders—
to the closest shade tree 
far enough away from the family. 
Alone, he spends the next half hour
slapping himself in the face.
Snaggletooth
I’m already questioning whether or not
I can get away with using that word—
if I can say snaggletooth and be taken seriously.
But that’s what Sarah said when she got back 
to Greensboro from her new position 
an hour out of town. Look at my snaggletooth
she said—broke biting my thumbnail.
Surely I should mention a few key facts
if I want snaggletooth to sail. It was her first day 
on the job, for example, and her nerves 
were something like a shipwreck after our move
from New Orleans; so who could blame her 
for taking whatever action against anxiety she had 
at her fingertips—as the day’s memories 
danced past—as the pines lining the highway 
scrolled across the window or her Yaris.  
I’ll just go ahead and say central incisors 
to establish that her front teeth (the upper two)
have both been fake since sixth grade. 
Her dentist decided that she must’ve swum 
underwater—her thin lips parted—so often 
the chlorine nearly gnawed the enamel to pulp. 
There’s really no other way to explain it 
Sarah remembers the man saying.
Now I wonder if I should lie—say that Sarah
was driving to work rather than home— 
to invite you to see her stand behind a podium.
Look, most of her central incisor, stage-right,
is missing—new students’ terrible eyes gawking. 
Sarah keeps forgetting to stop parting
her lips, when, every few seconds, she smiles.
But now it looks like I can’t avoid the truth.
Now when Sarah glides across the room 
to find me at the table’s dark corner. And after
she leans over for a kiss, asks about my dreams 
like she does—her warm breath heavy 
with sleep—she skims that last bit about the lie— 
promptly reminds me she actually was  
on her way to work, then suggests I add in 
a few key facts I hadn’t planned on providing.
Instead of getting too into that now, I wonder
if I can fit in the dream I had last night—
a dream Sarah didn’t ask about, because I made 
that part up. She does ask me often 
about my dreams, but she didn’t this morning 
and this morning I woke from a dream 
in which I shit my pants. I even stumbled through
the dark hall to the bathroom—wiped my ass.
It was the first time I’d ever had that dream
but I remember nothing else, and when 
I wiped my ass there was nothing there. I guess 
that’s all I’ll say about it, which likely means  
I don’t need to bring it up at all, that I should 
probably focus on Sarah’s snaggletooth. 
But it looks like I’m failing—or is it flailing?  
 
So maybe I’ll start to wrap this up, tell you that 
once the tooth was replaced with a new 
porcelain temporary, Sarah broke it biting 
into an apple—central incisors first—a week later.
And she happened to be on the way home 
to Greensboro from her new position an hour 
out of town. But at this point, if you’re still 
listening, how can you believe anything I say? 
If you believe I ever wanted you to believe 
I was always telling the truth—yes, I have failed 
or one of us has. I just wanted to invite you 
to see Sarah holding her broken tooth 
as she drove home, to see it resting on the bed 
of an awkward palm so she wouldn’t lose it.  
I wanted you to see her saunter in minus a tooth.  
And, if you haven’t yet, to see her lips part 
to make room for her smile—then 
just after—to hear her say snaggletooth; to feel 
something like gratitude when I tell you now 
she eats with the corner of her mouth—
careful not to be too hungry to forget. But really 
sometimes I just need to let someone know
how she makes me flail, which feels 
something like smiling underwater, a mouthful 
of pool held at the ready to squirt between 
my teeth—still smiling—when I come up for air.

hustling online legal documents 
the greedy details that keep you going
abroad like the silhouettes of sailboats
in parallax sunset as you attempt
to settle in the mist of getaway 
      ii. 
(vent’s dormant           playing a crooked world straight
beleaguered impotence of immigrants
                                                divided by fissures in the system
a form of seventh extinction)
      iii. 
the getaway is ripe for mistakes 
all paintings, promises, delivered or undelivered 
tiny bottles of truffle oil hidden in your parents’ pantry 
muffulettas to go 
a quaking canine to import something blues from home 
frantic packing, goodbyes nourished on dwindling time
boots, belts, and bottles of basil hayden falling out the trunk
a few desperate final acts of subversion 
dug a mass grave for maga hats in dulles 
then        suspension of reality        flight    
afterwards you arrive to beautiful stumbles 
familiar surprises and unfamiliar contradictions
waterways of unpronounceable names 
you scan train passengers for a hint of friend
but it's mostly headphones, yourself included 
you get a small job mainly to get out of bed
then you realize—sans gunpoint—
the university is more dependency than the dream  
they are saying this country is now polluted
which defeats your intention of cleaning up
the land you soil, if not your act   
                                                         to trick the slyest of all:
life—such an escape artist metamorphosis  
this not yet universe, an escher of stunts
we excuse everything      drafting from square one
      iv. 
(insist anyway 
        you sluice) 
another city lights pilgrimage 
frisco, always a topshelf getaway destination 
this time, from december and the dutchies—
as we’ve come to affectionately 
and not-so-affectionately call them
like most things said, read, or unsaid
it really just depends on the tone
a promising two nights in a real city
(pardon the air of superiority; it’s only
 a retort from a recent lowly immigrant) 
arriving directly from drinks at stanford 
to a bought room at the hyatt regency
on embarcadero, I check in to a free sierra
not a bad city start as city starts go
I change clothes to something more street
more comfy, more meant for walking 
north beach in december and I’m off
alone, it’s as simple as that
sidewalk footsteps insinuate skyscrape—
the transamerica pyramid always gets me 
on the return, a 48-story of futurist
brutalism, a behemoth I can’t help 
but ankle in awe, yet slight going out 
my mission is simple and three-fold:
first, an authentic bowl of pho, then 
buy little boy, ferlinghetti's newest book
a memoir veiled novel but all poem 
direct from my elder’s open mouth
(booksellers gettable until midnight!) and
end by beginning the book with drinks at vesuvio
creasing a brand new crystal ball of a book
running freely in the words in a crowd
hence the hills couldn’t stop my fresh feet 
and next thing I know I see broadway’s
neon signs shining striptease brighter
and more unwavering than any standard
as of late      I think about endurance 
esp. the seedy persuasion and wonder 
if us low of the low—strippers and junkies
to which many would include beat poets, aren’t
actually still on-to something    how this street stands 
as tall as any sky-fracker in the financial
I see city lights and I can’t contain myself 
skipping in like a schoolchild who already
has a friend on the first day of first grade
lawrence, lawrence, where are you? 
ready or not… given I’ve turned preadolescent 
the bespectacled bookworm behind the counter
fails to capture my attention
I dart to the city lights stacks
instantly finding the legendary HOWL
I flip to the footnote
allen’s holy of holies
the ASSHOLE
delight in impure jubilation!
I put it back only to spot an old baltimore friend
city lights put out madison smart bell’s latest
now there’s a contemporary that writes cities! 
make a mental note to scoop up that one 
when I’m flush again, having skipped the country
and not received a full check since august
WTF no lawrence front and city center?
guess I’ll have to comb the other stacks
scouring—a little desperately I might add—
(my belly empty with the exception of cheers)
the shelves of recently-released fiction
close to the register, I sense I had forgotten 
my safety net headphones intentionally
craving an urban earful these two short days
surely a dangerous poem or two to overhear
given I grew up in bookstores and libraries
knew the alphabet, title, even author this hunt
must just be a masochist’s gratification delay or
maybe it was to overhear the following exchange:
a buttoned-up young man walks up to the purple-haired girl
at the city lights register and asks innocently about the bookstore
who they were, have they been here long      this should be fun
“uh, we’re famous,’ she responds. “have you ever heard of HOWL?”
...really lady, you start with ginsberg, instead of lawrence
and don’t even say ginsberg’s name…
“haven’t” he concedes with a sausalito smile
“there was like an obscenity case against it that went 
to the supreme court.” “oh,” our bashful suitor offers 
“so do you have any books about business?” 
oh shit     buffoon     she’s going to really flog you now
instead, kindly and without condescension she says: 
“um no, we’re not that kind of bookstore”
by the time our mba politely thanks her and leaves
I’m done eavesdropping and I’ve found 
ferlinghetti, published by doubleday!
I rush to the register to purchase 
and to my dismay    not a nod
comment or little praise 
about the appropriateness
of the selection given the setting        nada
should I offer a quip, code of being in the know? 
just the old receipt and bag query, both refused
I had found the friend I came for
and we were already chasing each other to the bar
alas, poor vesuvio, brimming with tourists
besides myself and silicon sleaze    so much so
two friends that have met but never shared life stories 
could barely find a nook to get down to the deets
upstairs was out of the question so order first
“two sierras,” I shout, “and close me out” 
dodging tech metaphors like pipelines and ecosystems
we find the corner of corners at the bar, waiting
and meant to be     good and hoppy I tackle all the front
and back matter, and finally settle down to listen
to a last hero standing’s unbelievable story
imbuing his mind myth of coney island
origin of love where his immigrant parents met
crashed bumper cars and started a family of five
mother couldn’t afford after father died
so the kid was whisked off to france by a rich aunt
only to wind up back in a u.s. orphanage from whence
your boy manned up to command sub destroyers 
in the dday invasion of normandy continuing to wander nagaski
 7 days after “fat boy” dropped apocalypse 
making him instant pacifist—not to mention
studying at chapel hill and doctorate in 3 years in paris
what a tale and what a tail to tell it with? wink wink. 
30 pages deep the beer emptied and my stomach in need
of a healthier brew plus it was too loud for the intimacy 
we required anyway   the spell broken and I had proved my tiny rebellion
by reading at a packed bar, once and again literally literary
leaving I notice some ruffians in kerouac alley smoking 
with acoustic guitars but I have no urge to join 
their little band        I peek back inside city lights and the 
young woman working is tapping her phone      expected
I confess I too have tapped between pages
sending vesuvio drunk texts to andrei, bill
and dewitt, not to mention beseeching google maps to improve
my chances of finding the best of nearby broths
the trafficked street silent, holy, I look up, knowing ferlinghetti
in the flesh is probably in bed above me        again, where, precisely
I’m not sure        I try to decipher the lights       which windows 
likely residential    search the possibilities for his abode— 
there’s a third floor one that looks promising—and if perchance
he’s up, making a trip to the restroom as old men tend to regularly do
I decide maybe the doors are a better strategy
really only two entrances that could be his threshold:
one on columbus or this other one on grant       
maybe a tiny one on broadway but I’m not betting on it
there’s less than ten buzzers between them
should I just press each one? start with this one
glowing faint orange in front of me? I read names
on the buzzer boxes        poets love mail         we may be the last 
on that front too, besides all these amazon packages
another deduction        a 100-year-old bookseller probably  
isn’t spending too much time shopping online        
there’s a nonsense-moniker sounding name that sorta jives
with beat sensibility       should I ring?       the temptation 
is edenic      I hear andrei in the window
at the molly’s at the market of my mind
saying: “you want to meet a poet? go ring their doorbell.” 
but I can’t force myself to do it
bug the old man        who knows his condition when woken
(I know mine) how lucid he’d be, if he would even receive me
I abandon my eyes, still scanning the dim windows above
imagine our meeting       two italian-american poets 
one still chasing the dream and one founded one
interpreting melodies in unison or more likely disagreeing
we could have that drink or smoke together
what would he advise me?       what would I read him? 
I abandon the what-might-be-my-last-chance
fantasy of great-poetic-grandfather
who wrote the only book of poetry with over a million copies in print
AND fucking BELLOWED out Ginsberg’s “famous” HOWL
for all to hear
for all to read
I stash his fresh words in my jacket pocket
that’s enough for me 
for now
and for all time
together 
we will go 
searching for warmth and spice 
moped morse code 
engines every morning 
outside my window:
rev
long dash
dot dot
short dash
stop
bromfiets 
pass
swerve 
hit the speed bump
off stop
some ciphers smoother electric
others dilapidated hollow mufflers 
clanging tin disintegrating
drum in ear 
where slumber still urges 
the rattles of the bicycles
over the stone roads
even the pedaling 
becomes a character 
in this communicative commute 
the routine
disturbs me 
enough to rise 
as I have work to get to too
but first  
a tiny getaway
to fill my tea and a page 
amidst all their indecipherable racket 
chainsaw mopeds deforesting 
their provincial streets
Porch Beers VS. the Bore of Existential Fears
What are our friends in New Orleans doing right now? 
That’s the question I ask Sarah sometimes 
after a few beers on the porch—
tonight as I crack the fourth; Sarah, her second. 
For a moment she just rocks on the swing—smiles 
and sips her Peroni. Sips again. 
I suggest we make it a game—play pretend. 
Sarah decides she’ll take Jordan and Veronica. 
I choose Adrian and Darcy. 
Adrian prepares lasagna. His hands zombie-hover 
above boiling noodles. Darcy in the den 
prepares Sunday’s sermon on the joy of creativity.                       
Jordan is mixing a stiff martini in a mason jar.                          
Veronica shimmies over with two fat olives—plops 
them in. Gives his ass a little pat.
The game goes on like this for maybe 10 minutes. 
A few friends are drunk, more than one 
sporting a pair of ass-less chaps, but none 
are getting away with anything we wouldn’t. 
We both swallow a long drink, slow and deliberate 
like a song insisted we do it. 
I check our phones to see which has the most life; 
put on the Spotify playlist Sarah made 
for Halloween—our last in New Orleans. 
Depeche Mode’s “Ghost” creeps up and we’re out 
of beers. I haunt the house for something darker. 
A spent can becomes an easy ashtray. 
On nights like this we burn through a whole pack                          
with little shame. I mention Vince, who 
always says scags for cigarettes. 
But Vince just moved to Delft maybe a month ago. 
He can’t be a part of our little game.
What the hell’s Vince doing in Delft? I ask anyway.                           
Yeah—or Peyton and Ryan in Richmond? 
Sarah asks, grabbing the bottle before I’m ready 
to give it up. But we’ve both had enough.
VI. THE DAMPEST OF SPIRITS
one puddle
in particular 
makes my 
rainy days
most days
it’s the mere
formed in
the middle
of the bike 
path under 
construction 
heading to 
campus
and away
from delft’s 
center city
canal's
southern 
drain
the dampest 
of spirits 
is no match
for crossing
this puddle
as we speed
in packs
like sunk rats
to face our duties 
and whatever 
gnaws on us
there’s a moment
in passing
where everyone
secretly
delighted
slows down
pulls their feet 
off the pedals
(some even rise!)
as if about to float 
and coasts
out of their 
brooding into 
the inevitable
splashing
out of
personal 
paths 
we
acknowledge
our own role 
in
jeopardy
and
the oncomer
making
us
all kin
in our brief exodus
from everything
Now When I am		
Now when I’m walking around 
Kenyon College I'm thinking of that 
Frank O’Hara poem the one 
about how funny it would be if we 
only shit once a week because it's raining 
here not cats and dogs I don't know 
if I've ever said it's raining cats and dogs 
if I said something like that now 
I'd say skunks and spiders 
that's what I have in my head right now 
I have spiders in my head spiders 
because Andy said the other night that 
he's always looking out for spiders
around here then later I saw 
a web while we smoked on the porch 
outside the O'Connor house and I 
mentioned it to him said better look out 
and pointed at the web which 
had no spider just a bug I don't know 
the name of and when I pointed  
to the web I remembered remembering 
to tell him I saw a spider on Brad 
at the bar the other night it was sort of 
still in a way that made it seem lost 
and surely it was lost so I cupped it 
in my palm took it outside into the drizzle 
and now it's raining again it wasn't 
when I saw the skunk with Geoff 
and Jennifer the skunk that skunked right 
toward us yesterday afternoon 
when the sun showed up and the skunk 
must have felt liberated in that flash 
of warmth like us when it rose 
to sniff the air then skunked slowly off 
to sniff other air other air not wet 
with rain it wasn't raining then but now 
it's raining again but harder than 
before and now I'm thinking of that 
Frank poem that particular one because 
that's when I think I got Frank 
the first time I mean really got him when 
I was on the phone with him sort of 
as he might say alone in my apartment 
alone in a new city in a new state 
with no one to talk to or have lunch with 
and it was raining out and my apartment 
was dark like I like it when I'm reading 
the dark that drives my wife crazy 
that tells her to tell me I'll go blind 
maybe I don't like it maybe I just don't 
remember to turn on the light 
but there is something about that kind 
of natural light that gray middle-of-the-day 
rain-light coming through the blinds 
that makes you feel like you're in a cabin 
on a big boat going somewhere exotic 
and that's the kind of rain we have 
now the kind of light walking around 
Kenyon through the rain on the way 
to lunch at the deli where I have a bagel 
and lox that I just about finish before 
a couple folks show up I can’t remember 
their names and I’m sad I can’t remember 
their names but happy they join me 
and we talk about potato chips and tattoos 
music and movies then Andy joins us 
too and maybe that's when we start in 
about movies and now I'm thinking 
of Frank again who loved the movies 
and I like to think loved the rain and sun 
the same and that maybe that kind 
of thing just kind of killed him you know 
but now alive sitting down for lunch 
at the deli now we are in love with 
Birdman with talking about Birdman and 
Whiplash and the ends of things 
we’re so in love with the ends of things 
the ends of movies but also the ends 
of other things we don't talk about I can tell 
we are in love with those things too but 
when we leave we don't walk together 
we all split up take off at different times 
like airplanes lined up on a runway but we're 
all going to the same place but where 
I want to go is that old church on the hill 
not because it's beautiful it is but I am 
thinking of Frank and that first poem I fell 
in love with that first poem I called up 
on the phone had lunch with when it was 
raining and my apartment was dark 
and I was alone and now walking through 
Kenyon in that kind of rain I remember 
he ended the poem with a Sunday 
and a church and a plop and I ended it with 
a laugh and loved the beginning  
and the end of something the same 
and maybe got hungry enough to get out 
in the rain to get some lunch or something
but now after just having lunch maybe 
now I'll go check out the church on the hill 
to see what the lighting inside is like
stations of the crossed
saw a belly hanging out
of a slob on the train
passed out all the way
from delft
to amsterdam playing
the whole car
rap over his speakerphone
(common in the states
but here it stands out)
a young couple reunited
dancing in the crowded
airport train depot 
an infant straddled 
between them
exceeding the spirit
of carols streaming
from a less festive display
a dreadlocked dude
face-timing with his girl
enjoying the stinkiest
landfill of onions, frites
and mayonnaise 
like a last supper
and conjugal visit
a millennial band of 
merry travelers
singing “take me home
country roads...”
gathered around 
the station’s
grand piano
a refrain I change 
to dedicate
to my dog and
croon to no one
in particular
pretty regularly 
but it took this 
chorus to remind 
me of the good 
ol original
john denver
and there’s me 
still implicated
sneaking in 1st class
when 2nd gets full
with a notepad, pen
and a coat full 
of heinekens 
always ready to flee
I’ve never gotten caught
yet to be fined
but I’m writing 
this book 
so there’s 
an ongoing
hope 
The New Human Within
Now as I think again I need to become 
a new human I’m back in New Orleans 
in line at Breaux Mart thinking 
only this city would have a store like 
this and as the oblivious yet pissed  
off cashier has to call whoever she calls
to check the price of a tomato
a shopper three shoppers ahead of me
has placed in front of her
I’m thinking after all that’s happened   
people still bother to pick just the 
right ripe tomato and in the same sky 
egrets will fly above the ugly 
bayou I’ll drive by on my way home 
but now I never ever turn up
my radio in my shitty car because NPR 
harks on about depression 
and bombs and to someone out there 
Monday may mean murder
some guy named Tom but I just wrote 
the word harks just because 
it sounded good and I am my best self 
now when I am this nuclear 
breath of air and not Tom and I’m not 
going to be afraid of a shootout  
there’s not a single tomato in my cart
and on my way home again 
not for a minute will I tune in  
roaming free blues, a systemic murder ballad
what kind of impossible
restructuring do we 
really need
to release 
non-violent drug 
offenders
and petty criminals 
those whose imprisonment
has more to do 
with impoverishment
or color
and 
to cast some stones
and incarcerate 
the grayscale
spectrum 
of stalkers 
and sex abusers
that never seem 
to face any 
consequences
from on high
in fact full
of direst cruelty
crowns on 
bigots and creeps
think 2019
is their year
encouraged by
oval approval 
and the silent
and powerless 
resignation 
of their prey
that has made
america a great place
to roam    for them
and in this year alone
no less than four women
in universities—have told me
and I’d bet more 
than the vast majority
esp knowing the service industry—
have been stalked, harassed 
or worse by someone
who will not even
get a puny slap
on their sturdy
slime-ridden wrists
an impregnable figure
daily tormenting 
unless one resorts to 
hiding at home 
these swine are ruins
and ruin is a specialized 
knowledge esp 
in institutions
but worse
they have the rules 
and state authority shares
their disposition
let freedom ruin
this is a lament 
for the unjust 
treatment of 
more than 
our wives
mothers
daughters
this is a call
to end this curse
of acceptance 
and poisoned authority 
all too prevalent 
throughout our planet
to topple sexed power 
& annihilate the status quo 
Unrepentant Caverns 
I’m in New Orleans sitting in a private 
school’s chapel service holding a thought 
that only god is godless as the 
monstrously large organ pipes whine 
behind me as I imagine a passenger plane 
crashing through the boringly bat-less 
rafters where the organ pipes rise 
toward the polished wood of the slanted 
ceiling at the back of the chapel 
as I’m reminded of how much the pipes  
look like stalagmites or maybe fingers 
of stone fingers bumpy with so many 
knobby knuckles it’s as if they belong 
to some ancient witch buried 
beneath an ancient cave so long ago 
that somehow they’ve grown 
so monstrously large that a massive hand 
has managed to crack through the stone 
floor only to always point up and 
I’m thinking how strange it would be 
to always point up to just be in one place 
forever pointing up toward 
whatever is always pointing down 
and now when I slide my fingers 
over the strange shapes that line the floor 
of my memory I’m reminded of all 
those knobby fat fingers I saw
glistening with fresh water dripping 
from the roof of the cave I toured once 
at Silver Dollar City when I was a kid 
and now when I’m remembering 
how weird it was that a cave was hidden 
under an amusement park that 300 
feet above where the hanging stalactites 
dripped their years of slow drips down 
from the dark ceiling was the roar 
of rollercoasters and so much screaming
I’m remembering how weird it was 
that no one said a thing about how weird 
that was that the boring tour guide 
just kept pointing up at all the glistening 
stone like tiny lights clicking infinitely 
on and off and when I remember the cold
of that cave it’s a continuous breath  
on the back of my neck but now when I 
shift around in my seat the imagined 
passenger plane crashes yet again big white  
nose first through the boringly bat-less 
rafters and now when the wood splinters 
down over the crowd of students
and teachers I have one of those out-of-body 
experiences I guess because I’m floating 
out over the pew full of singing kids nearest 
the back of the chapel and now when I see
myself down there sitting song-less 
sucking cinnamon Altoids two at a time 
as the charming young priest is beginning 
his sermon on the dangers of drugs
and here comes the plane no one notices 
crashing through the bat-less rafters 
slow motion style and without sound and 
now when I’m not surprised about 
any of this I’m not surprised how suddenly 
my wingspan is unbelievable and how 
easy learning to fly is but now back in a pew 
again sitting with all the singing kids
I can’t see myself fly up there 
to catch the plane in my palm to save all 
the oblivious kids from all their silent 
screams as they dream of Mardi Gras break
and now the priest pauses a priestly 
pause and sharpens his long tongue against 
the kids and the pulpit becomes a box
of bats that fly up to hang from the rafters 
and I feel like a finger made of stone 
sacred in sacred out
yet another lazy sunday
exclaiming the lord’s name in vain
gettin away 
from god 
for many a young person
is the premiere struggle 
in reverence 
in reference
when all the metaphors
we inherited 
cease 
to make you believe 
or yearn for the shepherd 
of sight in order to find 
a spiritual king’s dominion
so you abandon the words first
and then the flock
which often pits you 
against your own parents 
self-compelled jailers of beliefs 
their child’s personal creators
and saviors and while I’ve never
had the pain of raising a human
volunteering my child to list
every sin for an education
is a helluva trade
I believe in the line
a poet’s ramblings to reach 
farther into this world and the next
converse with the living and the dead
instead of taking up a collection
or asserting some authority
hence I refuse most institutions
formed to spread or profit
from a particular dogma 
and personally I’ll always have 
more respect for people that
fight religion than follow it
to me there’s more god 
in the peter moment
the thrice denial
a predicted act of cowardice 
as commonly interpreted 
but there’s something exceptional
lingering there—more than the weakness
which jesus shared asking to be spared—
of not following any prophet or god
to battle nor death  
a refusal of association
and martyrs 
working out their lines
lately I place less emphasis on my denials 
I’ve come to grips with us
in terms of physics
entirely as energy or spirit 
the collective unconscious
recycling souls
in the solar expanse 
an image of our age 
a conception I hope you deny 
Will the Real Secret Agent Please Stand Up?
Now when I’m wishing I could slip back 
into an old loneliness I’m back home
in New Orleans back to the first year there 
and walking back to the corner 
coffee shop again when I remember it’s 
Easter as a swarm of flowery dresses 
and fancy ties crowd to cross Magazine  
then I look down at the dirty shirt
the one with the nerdy cat wearing glasses
printed on it the one I’ve worn for days 
lazy-haunting the house then I’m reminded 
how much of a mess I become 
when Sarah’s gone and Sarah’s gone 
to Paris but now as I notice our neighbors 
eating brunch outside Gott Gourmet 
I’m thinking of the pile of mail 
I left for them recently when I housesat 
for them while they were gone 
to Florida and they thank me for the pile 
of mail and ask me to join them but 
I’m trying to get good at being alone I’ve 
been trying to get good at being alone 
for the past 24 hours watching the entire 
first season of 24 on Netflix and now
I feel like a zombie and could really use 
their company but I just say thanks no sorry 
I’ve got to work and take off toward 
the corner coffee shop but it’s closed for 
Easter so I go to Starbucks and order 
whatever they call the biggest black coffee 
they’ve got take it back to the empty 
patio and it’s cold but I’m trying to get 
good at being alone and now I remember 
Sarah is seven hours ahead and
can call me up before she goes to bed if 
I’m logged on to the free Wi-Fi but when I 
look up from messing with the settings 
on my phone this muscled-up guy dressed 
in black cap black shirt black pants 
black socks black shoes walks through 
the patio and I imagine he must be 
a terrorist that he’s holding my neighbors 
hostage and somewhere in Paris his people 
have Sarah tied to a chair and now 
here he is with the phone that he’ll hold up 
to my ear so I can hear her voice
on the far-away phone held up to her ear 
to know she’s safe before he snatches it 
back and says they’ll slit her pretty throat 
right now if I don’t allow them 
to implement me in their plan to kill 
the president but of course when I look up 
again he’s gone inside and now I’m 
alone again alone on the cold patio hoping 
my international text to Sarah will send    
before it’s too late to say goodnight
mae’s-en-scène
also known as “the club”
a once smoke-filled
petri dish of new orleans
stepping in for the first time
as a youngun conjured
the enchanted scene
from star wars: a new hope
when obi wan takes luke
to the space bar to find a pirate
the drunken jazz, gambling
women, and fights spilling 
outside we never tired of
that reflective glass door
framed yellow and black portal
altered time after crossing
the glow of the namesake orange
neon on magazine
and napoleon
pushing the stiffest drinks 
you can find for $1
open 24/7, 3-6-5
it never closed
it stood to bewitch
its visitors & regulars alike
and a year or two 
it transcended to “our bar”
if you went early enough
you could have drinks
with miss mae herself 
who would cut your ass
if you disrupted her jeopardy
so you held your answers
like you had the hiccups
miss mae had a sandy mullet of curls 
and smoked winstons with a chain
thick enough she could anchor
in the deep sea 
legend has it 
she was a working girl
that bought her way out
then bought this dive
across from the police station
it was assumed she had dirt
on the entire town, especially them
running this type of establishment
on their front lawn
mae never lifted a finger
except to ash but she 
often raised her voice 
she would come in 
(sometimes with friends) drink 
greyhounds, smoke, shut people up, and watch tv
originally mae’s was further uptown
on magazine a location now called st. joe’s
both had reputations for underage drinking
hence why we came
and kept coming 
but everybody went to mae’s
musicians, locals, cooks, dealers
hobos, college students,
even the cops in street clothes
it was the closest spot
to tipitina’s to get cheap drinks
so before or after shows 
an influx of pre or post gamers
and random locals 
many costumed for one excuse or none
caused the club to ebb and flow
out of the side entrance
between the second pool
and foosball table
a door would swing wide open 
and people would spill onto 
the sidewalk cars parked 
all over smoking, puking
laughing, pissing
fighting, crying, fucking
any gerund 
you name it
we even spilled into the darker
shadows of the oaks in night
sitting on the stoops of mansions
to get our mind right
a reefer break as kermit 
still says before he ends a set
during mardi gras the place 
transformed into an atomic 
bomb shelter for boozing
wells lined with lead
all the tables, chairs, and games
removed to solely sling 
and offer a floor to piss on 
for hordes of shoulder to shoulder
parade goers
now this lyric turns litany
to remember our undoing 
one of infinite corners
our edge of dinge 
twisted in the club’s heyday:
occasionally playing pool
with hiram both drunk 
not even looking at the table
while shooting and beating 
people way better than us 
which would drive opponents mad
sneaking girls 
and friends 
without fakes
through the side door
sweet and gray
bassist walter payton
an old gentleman steady sippin 
some brown on the video poker
machines telling me and em
how he can only play with
his eyes closed
every time he saw us 
he’d use the line
you must be named michael 
because she’s an angel
tying one on by
slamming madrases or heinekens 
before or after countless 
shows at tips: tim reynolds, walter wolfman, 
fats domino, wilco, les claypool, george clinton
ivan neville’s dumpstaphunk, 
karl denson’s late night shows 
that didn’t start until 2 am 
and let out well after sunrise
stumbling home in daylight
thru saturday yard sales
uptown on our way home picking up 
a trinket to find in the afternoon 
cooks in checks screaming:
how long black out? 
walking in the front door
demanding waiters 
with pockets full of tips 
buy them drinks 
at the cheapest
bar in town 
buying drinks for any stranger 
ever because it was only $1 
meetings with dreadlocked swamp thing
to buy bubblegum kush which he hid
in a sock on his silver crotch rocket
he would ride to the club and back 
from the 9th ward 
eventually befriending him to the point
where he arranged a 6 ft. tank of nitrous
as a thanksgiving party favor beside the turkey fryer
wild man pulling a knife on darren
by the jukebox
buying shots after insults 
because it was cheaper and easier
to ruin an enemy with drink 
running the table of foos
playin $25 per ball
with ben and yoda
sprinting out the side door 
vomiting in the trash can outside
sometimes not making it
but always returning 
stumbling to sav-a-center 
once the clock read 4:44 
to buy bagels, champagne,
and astroglide 
finding a tulane friend
passed out on the raised toilet
behind the saloon doors
his pants down with bag of blow
and key in hand
a coke dealer and close friend
selling me a car for a $1 and a drink 
so 2 drinks
debating on hooking up with a friend
because she had peed herself
the evidence darkened her designer skirt
befriending all the bartenders 
smiling al & john, who went on to do porno 
post katrina days, which seemed a demotion
compared to manning the helm of mae’s
the year we didn’t pay for a drink
maybe we bartered a bit 
no spoken agreement
leaving with G to get inked 
or push a portapotty
over in the street
a cajun cook eating a girl out
in the back of a united cab 
running in the driveway with a crowd
cheering him on 
walker belligerently strolling into the police 
station demanding his car was stolen
only to find it the next day parked outside
walter drunkenly wrestling nicole 
in piles of parade trash
for what seemed like hours
on the neutral ground 
out front as firetrucks and prisoners
with rakes cleaned up after our first lundi gras bbq
G snapping a pool stick over his leg 
and plunging out the side door 
in frustration
because he didn’t punch someone 
who likely deserved it 
getting in a limo with strippers from shreveport 
going at it on the pool table with a more-tempting
-than-them promise of unending bottles
of budweiser &  jagermeister 
drifting uptown, downtown, st. charles, to the fly
eventually freebasing in audubon
in the weedless hours of morning 
before they went back and woke up 
wild man with a lap dance claiming 
he looked just like her son
getting handled by an off duty pig
smashing my face in the concrete stairs
held tight in hammer lock until al talked him off me
all because I had a pocket knife from painting
visibly hated his presence and may have told him
teasing hiram about decorating a wheelbarrow
with purple, gold, and green mardi gras beads
for dumping his overnight stays back on the corner of mae’s 
alternate endings
between mae’s and delmonico
or mae’s and theo’s
walk-in with molly 
to milan lounge
or the public storage  
practice space 
marengo moonlight and back
on any other given night 
partying or working 
really a combination 
a negligible difference 
flooding our guts past curfew 
with the national guard 
& fbi patrolling the streets
in their hummers & suburbans 
armed to the teeth 
endless verbal contests
from worst hit-on lines
to best fetishes 
the mardi mardi challenge 
walker and dr payne almost
made it 24 hours straight
drinking there 
I returned twice 
sleeping in between
the same timeframe 
throwing yourself out
of the bar by the collar 
because no one else would 
all the quotidian bar shit 
the countless recounts
of debauchery and shenanigans 
the jukebox favorites 
“sweet leaf” x 3
getting thrown out 
not remembering why
coming back dirty or clean the next day
no apology                no questions asked
no reward but the treasured hours 
                       we can’t remember
of friends        and feeling     
                              alive and fucked up
immune to
mistakes washed away in the mississippi 
I’m the Kingpin in the City of My Sad Song
Now as I’m lamenting everything
always getting away  
I’m again in New Orleans crying 
again at Kingpin when 
this guy in a pea coat walks in and 
shoves between me and Sarah 
so he can elbow the bar 
and now when I’m asking myself 
if he can see I’m crying
if he can tell that I’m the kingpin 
in the city of my sad song
I stop crying and start to want 
a White Russian because 
the guy in the pea coat orders two 
White Russians and I don’t
think I’ve had a White Russian
for something like ten years 
so I say we’ll take two of those too
without asking Sarah 
if she wants one and now she says 
she doesn’t want one 
but I know it’s one of those times
when I can’t take back 
anything that I can’t just change
my order after having
cried at Kingpin because it’s also
one of those kinds of times 
so I tell Sarah I’ll just drink hers 
and she smiles and says ok 
and gets up to go to the bathroom 
and I start to go weak 
in my knees when she leaves 
though I’m sitting down 
and now when I stare at the cooler
of imports I almost cry again 
but the TV hanging above the bar 
for some reason looks like 
the head of an alien my very own 
Sigourney Weaver has 
hunted down because she knows
I’m the kingpin in the city 
of my sad song and will always be
honestly 
leaving new orleans
was getting away from 
getting away with everything
and I know you felt now-or-never-compelled to do the same
and now we must exorcise the doubt of our chances of assimilating back to normal
society even if you increased your stay and survival    same as me
but hey one good thing is I’m not sure we’d have the distance
to stare into this puddle reflection still in the driver seats in this reckless hearse swerving
no place will ever be the same 
                          and neither will we 
for worst or utmost we believe in this swathe here
and caterpillars, our toast to those lost taking the protean risk
so our real getaway—if we get everything—swears more colors and wings 
than we can conjure up in carnival      and words remain our rootwork 
there are other muses to love     most kill     rob          or pollute you less  
                                      promise a burst     a flutter 
as opposed to tragic embryos sinking in quicksand 
then again amsterdam is a short train ride away and my boy thibs is coming next week 
street food nude
maybe once in montañita
high on conch & cocaine
a front cabana dinner
strip jenga in the sand
before the night’s bonfire where 
the german and argentinian
girls—after enjoying our joints—
proved more interested 
in the ecuadorian locals 
than any of our claims
    or maybe twice in cabo 
slurping raw clams & lemons 
preceded then chased 
by ice chests of pacifico
after being frightened
& relieved in a long shower
sharing soap with a friend
as I mistook 
a yellowfin fishing injury
for a mermaid std
    certainly a delusion in italy
for this graduate student
staying in a castle 
outside of dead man’s tower
overlooking the adriatic 
and ionian seas consummate
their affair    a daily fling
in santa maria di leuca
after diving my buddy and I
frequented the same stand
in the market for rotisserie 
chicken on a spit dripping
fat onto the potatoes below
two big bottles of heineken 
apiece behind the counter
was always the mother
who welcomed us warmly 
and her shy vision of a daughter
whose presence was as piercing
as the fares of her family
face that launched 1,000 spits 
she beset our quotidian orbits 
we termed her the chicken girl
an unworthy label not reflecting
our romantic estimation of her 
for far lesser beauty ruined
many far finer men    after a few days
we had a habit    of stalling 
and juggling the football 
with her baby brother 
we never noticed a father
and surely we assumed    if there was one
he’d have chased us off already 
we imagined scenarios
poor widowed or abandoned
and this fact only increased 
our infatuation        soon my fantasies 
increased in inebriated complexity 
including dropping out of grad school 
marrying this girl       starting a family
opening a dive shop and helping
run the family business       
feasting on 7 fishes christmas dinner on sea cliffs
when I realized I didn’t know what I was more 
attracted to: this bella to be my everything 
or the second chance to have an italian mother 
mother me              I knew it was time to leave 
Sharing a Smoke
	—for Michelle
Now that I’m getting away with all
that I can as I smoke my last 
Christmas cigarette in my mother's 
garage messy with broken-down 
boxes and empty paint cans before 
heading north to Illinois I imagine you 
sitting in that dark three-car garage
you often told me about in your long-
fingered letters the archive of emails 
I've been excavating in short trips
between short trips to the coffee shop
the liquor store on the county line 
the graveyard all the light always seen 
the new mall where most folks
in this small Arkansas town carry home 
something like god in shopping bags 
to pile beneath the twinkling tree
but when there is no atonement for how 
small everything inevitably becomes 
it drives me to smoke another cigarette 
to get in just one more puff before 
attempting again to leave behind what 
will always travel with me but when
I light another a fresh one I’m reminded  
again of the pile of ashes it seems 
we somehow both knew needed sifting
for seeds to keep going even though
I never gave it a name but when   
I imagine you alone in that garage that
dark garage with its massive fan 
saving you from the mean Florida heat 
even though you are gone you are 
growing larger behind the screen 
you behind the light of your laptop  
aglow with each flick of your cigarette
the used butts piling up beside you
an unlikely totem a song for giving up 
everything else you said but I wish 
we could share a smoke instead of this
northern high noon
how to postpone a duel 
move from southern saloons
to northern wooden taverns 
above the 52nd parallel
sun’s azimuth 
off to the side 
where high noon
if you’re lucky
looks like
the 10am LA
morning sun 
sweating 
is rare 
for suspects
and even folks
on the lam 
run outside
or call in sick 
from work 
to get some sun 
you could wait
around most
of the year 
for said climax
to come
miss it mistakenly
if you saw 
the white faint glow
that never achieves 
blazing this far
away from 
the equator 
a heated laissez
place more 
suited for bandits 
and bothering
showdowns
and disasters 
going down
crimes and passions
and crimes of passion
here a cold rotated egress
shadowless
which only accentuates
the former warmth of all
the getting aways
all the everythings
all the high noons 
under a burning sun
you stepped outside
they didn’t bury you 
The Obligation to Meaning
Now as my dog as always gets 
away with everything I ask myself 
if he has actually learned 
to speak in some supernatural flash 
of knowledge as he pauses 
after an initial whimper and I think 
I hear him say he’s beginning 
a new poem and that pit 
of plum sitting on book is the first 
line and now when I am 
wincing at this my wife says 
very matter-of-factly that he’s just 
engaging with the poetic 
possibilities of everyday life then 
twirls her finger in her hair 
for a bit before stopping to inspect 
the split-ends and now when 
I say OK to myself and leave them 
both to the sheeted furniture 
of their obligations to meaning then 
sink into the unmade bed 
of mine I hear a horn honk outside
and just like that my dog 
is back to barking and now when 
he turns his thoughts inward 
like a turned-off TV and now when
he cries out for the lost ones 
among us and now when he paws 
at the stuffed snake stuck 
under the couch for something like 
a year he promptly forgets 
about the beginning of the poem
raised as a barrel in the cellar
a damp incantation to wake 
during a lucid nightmare 
or uttered to stave off
the spontaneous fermentation of ghosts 
in a haunted hideaway of a world war 
also used as a lament for the lamentless
hence its inclusion in the present collection
in 18 mardi gras I solidified my childishness forever
the 19th I am apprehended by some stowaway adult in me
who guarantees if I don’t starve for at least this one
I’ll never be able to age this fantasy
there are older cellars 
more bulbous barrels 
not to mention different libations anthems and dances  
to learn by pouring yourself into
the span of our soul’s storage 
a shelf life of mystery which yearns for company and home
as well as delivery from the status quo into the unknown
the angel’s share, a deserved disappearance 
sips sacrifice everything 
we getaway in gulps 
our contents all catalyst 
missing mardi gras blues
try to tell myself mardi gras is a state of mind
given ubiquitous purple gold and green 
been replaced with daily wind, rain, and grey  
I swear, at least sisyphus, all this time,
was getting stoned on a mountain
a real punishment would have been  
a permanent bicycle commute in dutch winter 
so turn on the WWOZ to drown out all the doubt
pour some sequin wine
get out our favorite throws
no costumes claiming the house 
no glue gun to the head this year
no ham hocks or turkey necks smoked in the street
no stealing muffulettas or chicken wings
with an improvised doggie bag 
from some random party
I try to think of the filthiest thing available to eat:
kapsalon, a rotterdam invention, meaning “hairdresser”
doner toppings over gouda cheese fries 
before heading out to procure the grease feast 
we play a motivation round of “iko iko” and “indian red”
I don the tasteful naked lady button-down I found
in goodwill decades ago and it’s provided 
every muses since
my two and four-legged angels
and I strut the medieval streets
feign a hoot and holler
that really doesn’t outweigh the dutch frat boys
on a given saturday but we make a scene or three 
all in the name of the day
after a jenever tasting 
miraculously we find a small band of brass and a snare to follow 
about 20 catholic dutchies drunk with LEDs making a racket 
marching around city center waving colors 
below dark gothic towers and protestant grimaces
from the wealthy apartments above
although not as many, a few admirers
rush to the windows and doorways
swaying all smiles and waves
mostly children really but a few parents too
reminding me: wherever you go
go in joy     raise spirits 
form a getaway parade
               the otherwise 
from gloomy days
find your people 
tell them everything
if for only an hour
before we all disperse into the dark 
The New Bird Sings
Now when I’m listening to what 
we’ve been calling the new bird sing 
what sounds like cheeseburger 
cheeseburger cheeseburger outside 
the window because Sarah says 
it sounds like it sings cheeseburger 
cheeseburger cheeseburger 
Sarah who sounds a lot like she’s  
getting away with most everything
while she looks through the window 
while she works at her desk 
while she listens while I imagine her 
whistling while she works 
Sarah who maybe if we were young 
in the 50’s I would have called 
a bird a nice bird or a pretty bird 
something like that maybe 
look at that little birdie over there 
I might have said at a carnival 
somewhere in Kansas to some fool 
fool enough to be friends with me 
but we aren’t living in the 50s 
and south Louisiana isn’t any place 
like Kansas so to convince her 
to marry me I just said please 
come to this Halloween reading I’ll
be all dolled up channeling
Dorothy Parker at a bar 
down the street and now that was 
nearly nine years ago so I guess 
it worked but now we never talk 
about Baton Rouge with all its
warring corner drugstores where all 
the young couples crowd around 
the red boxes planted all over town 
for the newest movie about the 
oldest past times instead we keep 
on like everyone pretending 
we’re different we’ll live forever 
if we just keep singing like a couple 
of street birds like new birds
with our beaks full of cheeseburger
cheeseburger cheeseburger 	
one last hurricane party in NC
long before we fly away from everything
our everything flooded our coup 
of causeways, levees, and rougarou
so it seems only appropriate 
on our one evening together
before leaving the country
we get a hurricane party in nc
rain thick and theatrical
like its presence had been paid for 
a professional mourner storm
gathered above a united states 
and brobaby wake of sorts
avoiding premature threats
to jump into the grave
(we remind ourselves
we climbed out of one)
I went downtown to replace 
my brother’s glasses—gratefully 
the only thing lost in another 
average pizza delivery mugging—
then the wailing started 
so we rushed back to the house
(after buying bottles of booze)
like any good louisianian knows to do
we also made a second line parade
during a soft spell found in a crevice between clouds
noisily marching with both families, dogs, and umbrellas
to discover and admire a lightning tree
brought down blackened a block away
returning we all porch sat for a beer or two
new rain curtains straining the leftover light of day
angeliki looked comfortable swinging 
and playing dress up with finn
the hounds resigned themselves
to their spots on the floor
while the rest of us began reminiscing
ever-ascending in our flight of festivities
this wasn’t our first party
where the lights went out
singing and dancing in front 
of all our books to the boss
sarah gracefully pulls out the candles
—duly making their lighting and placing 
an impromptu performance—
while I prepare a champagne toast 
shippy insists on starting a corpse 
so we pass the glasses and pen
scribbling and drawing flickers as if
it was our amalgam’s last stand
VII.  LIVING PAST THE INVISIBLE
corona cooler 
my parents have had this ivory green-lidded, hard shell 
handle-locking cooler probably since the seventies
I have wish fulfillment dreams about filling it 
perpetually in past garages being prepared
or in the trunk teeming with tea, ice, soda cans 
a staple while driving errands around town 
as my step-mother          god bless her soul 
to this day and with no exaggeration 
considers making groceries a commission 
to visit no less than five stores
especially reliant on it for our road trips
we used to drive to camden, charleston, myrtle beach 
up I-95 to connecticut for christmas
packing sandwiches, spreads, string cheese 
you name it      but it was the family cooler
                              meaning little to no beer 
(until I got a hold of it in adolescence) 
it’s curious how many things get lost between 
two divorces    three children       three to five moves
(depending on who’s counting)
a first born male’s curfew abuse 
after being dragged to idaho 
in the midst of high school
but that cooler still rides 
(I have another relict 
a soft heineken six pack satchel
my college girlfriend gifted me
from the amsterdam factory
that made it through 18 mardi gras 
and fatedly found its way home 
to the netherlands—even after
a few months stint with the shipmans!)
I walk to the cooler’s corner 
in my parents’ garage 
even now as I type across the atlantic
notice how the lid is upside down
placed ajar to ensure evaporation
still the shell’s integrity is supreme 
the lid’s green no less olive
the ivory bottom a softer cream
like out-of-tune piano keys 
that cooler sashays to me in my sleep
I count the ways to get it here opposite
to how the media now counts the corona cases
per country and how everyone crusades
about where you’re from and 
where you’ve been
facemasks first         online auctions
asians wearing out of consideration
even started appearing on the faces
of public sculptures 
handshaking bans
airports and ubers abandoned 
conferences canceled 
weddings      honeymoons        postponed 
universities suspending live instruction
sporting events played in closed stadiums
this morning’s viral video 
shelby county parents 
spraying their kids with lysol in the street
the pickup line turned picket line
one woman all decked out 
with thick yellow raincoat and grocery bags
an impromptu hazmat suit
for living past the invisible 
despite the media’s all-day dose of virus
in which they can’t seem to decide
if cases or deaths are more worth reporting   
over a week into quarantine
and we haven’t been armed with real information about biology
or protocol for treatment besides calling our family doctor 
if we have a fever and staying at home for two weeks
(who’s ice chest in a city is full enough to last that long?)
then what? you either die or you get over the covid? 
care to disclose any long-term effects to us?
from what little I know viruses—like coolers—can last 
a lifetime and can store many a thing deep inside them
but since all probability indicates this beer-named plague
is not grand enough to cause the end of times 
I’m going to return to my cold plot to import this heirloom
to europe for summer excursions to scheveningen
Spring Quarantine 
I wondered if my wife snapped 
a quick pic of me 
sprawled out beside her on the lawn.
It seemed like an opportunity
to get a good shot. 
Legs stretched. Booted feet 
crossed. Hands tucked 
behind my head, tilting the grey 
Carhartt hat 
down over my eyes to block 
what little sun there was. 
Last year’s Best American Poetry 
open face-down on my chest.
Quarantine—the pithy Instagram 
caption could read— 
or maybe The Poet Dozes Away 
Another Apocalypse.
I wanted her to snap 
the pic, but I didn’t want to say it.
I didn’t want a single word to fall 
from a single mouth.
Not only because I wanted her 
to think I was asleep. I just 
wanted her to know—somewhere 
in her beautiful blood.
I just wanted 
something to happen—to fall 
naturally into place.
We’re not talking anyway. Not 
about anything other 
than COVID-19 anyway—singing 
its monstrous aria, or trying to 
over the sui generis 
notes of spring, which is 
why I was on the lawn (I remind 
only myself) in the first place. 
I had to face the facts. Yesterday 
was the first day 
of spring. And last night brought 
the first spring rain.
Before my wife sat beside me 
she was on the porch— 
the light wind holding her 
like a kind of triage 
for what the wind might prescribe 
in whatever crueler months 
come to stumble us.
When she saw me she drifted 
down to the damp grass, 
with her stack of ungraded papers. 
I still don’t know if she snapped
a pic on her phone—of me
pretending to sleep. I’ll ask her
when we’re talking again
about anything that resembles 
anything again.
Now, hours later, seems like days.   
She’s on the phone 
with her brother, checking in 
to see how his business in Maine 
is faring against the virus.
They spend a long time talking 
about the repeated failures 
of their father and older brother 
to make amends. 
Then my wife mentions 
their grandfather, a WWII hero.
He was someone, she says
who saw the end 
of the world, then lived past it.
Now it’s raining again—harder 
somehow, because Mark 
our neighbor and friend, is back 
from visiting his mother
at the hospital. I wonder 
if it’s safe to be around him 
now—now as I’m reading a text 
he just sent, about 
rethinking our buddy status 
during quarantine.
I wonder what iniquity will mean
tomorrow, the third day
of spring. I wonder
if my wife will snap, or me.
Try to forget how to begin
any sentence with when or wind.
The rain’s stopped for now. 
I need to brave the store 
for bread and beer. First I’ll move 
the box of sidewalk chalk 
from the driveway. 
I don’t want to ruin one 
of our daughter’s distractions.
Her sun is already a yellow smear 
across the concrete— 
a broken yoke left to gather 
an army of ants—
and I’m no war hero. 
ride again
time will show you its tell 
in the love letters of an outlaw
kept next to your breast 
the ones
that demand
tall bottles 
and pens 
in saloons 
chief 
in company 
of fools
making our marks
with the only weapon 
ever able to deny
laws man-made
and natural 
our first hands
we lay large blinds
against distance
go all in 
on a bluff
the action
of friends
writers
lovers
a trifecta 
at the track
wearing our lucky 
go-to-hell hats
then we find the real stakes
to our wagers we place 
with our very lives
the who
what 
and where
of the ride 
with a why 
so often found
only in hindsight
like the perfect type of light 
you need to detect it’s raining
during the day sometimes 
but then again
it could just be your eyes—
old accomplices 
The News on the Corner
it’s difficult to describe the noise 
of news on constant cycle 
eternally               blooming in the bottom
corner of my computer screen
but I don’t have to 	you      know what
it sounds like         like
mario eating a mushroom 	            like
a coin dropped into a slot like a voice
that doesn’t know what 
language to speak         that doesn’t know 
what language is     that is      lost in a sea
of its own making of waves      of its own
making waves that are
our fears our masks our latex gloves 
gripped around the splintering wood
of our protest signs of our protests   of us 
protesting because every      gust of wind 
is reminiscent of a lover           leaving us 	             
for a country burying      the hatchet with 
all the hatchets then digging up all 
the hatchets with hatchets    till the dirt is 
packed like silence is buried
is the language of 
                  the corner of heart it falls out      
speaks something      we want 
to hear    we want                    to believe 
no more knees pressed into necks  
no more shooting or tweets about 
shooting no more presidential policing      
                                                    no more
noise blooming like loud dark 
mushrooms darkening 
loudly at the bottom of          our screens
like the opposite                        of cartoons       
or video games     lost to the sea of dreams 
black kids can’t grow up            to become 
because of us eternally us
failing to describe corners coined    
which is all to say 	     my eyes my ears
are strapped         to you              my friend
so rejoicing           I am                   to be
to get away           with              everything
to share this sacred space is to hold
ourselves in the dark 	       to press against 
the noise	                       the terrible
novelty of light                to tell every story
to get away
		with		        nothing
if not a line                                         break
on my 37th year and yet another day around the sun
gas grenades and rubber bullets win yet another day
riots and racism protests burn in the divided states furnace 
after yet another series of executions by the police
men and women caught red-handed for being black
in the streets or in their homes fast asleep
my country is suffering a pandemic, a recession and 
is so divided it can’t even take a breath of the least polluted skies
it’s tasted since before the industrial revolution
back home between protests
my friends board up windows
ready the generators as yet another
hurricane looms on louisiana 
so far away I reach further within
nowhere near comprehending 
america is sick in the head 
as the old folks used to say
some now probably repeat 
as if simple bigotry could save them from a plague
sickened by their lack of surplus
without identifying the correct culprits 
like welfare money is better off buried
even after civil rights and the hippies 
the powers at be managed to slip us
america’s true favorite drug: ignorance 
hey greatest generation 
or everyone wearing red white and blue ball caps
the black bodies that made it great the first time
can take no more abuse  
it’s not a threat to you
to eliminate the centuries-standing death threat on blacks
sheathe your assault rifle and park the tanks 
we’re just trying not to get here yet again
yet another birthday sentiment
when we usually make a wish or two for the impossible
bargain days      a mad dash backwards from the grave 
the earliest hide and seek we never win
but blue on black death on a daily basis...
and although I’m not out in the streets dodging police
to make a statement of solidarity 
I violently punch keys that know no answers 
the letters are my only black neighbors
they are the only way I can join the drumline for justice 
determined forms that build the page black and permanent
as the night and the fears we steady there are infinite
follow the yellow bit inroad 
stockpiling serendipity 
in a server cave 
of technocracy 
like it was sarin 
and we’ve got 
an oz plot planned 
but the era of terror 
got too stale to sell 
so now there’s 
a new normal to swallow
making bygone terrorist threat levels 
look like paint by numbers 
for world travel as we are now
more or less embargoed  
contained to a dull panic
pandemic 8 weeks reborn
alone, unformed ironically 
by being over-informed despite 
less ado about everything 
big data eats the little 
isolation worm afraid
of where the sidewalk begins
or just going to the store
ricocheting to the voids
of the aisles with more
end times supplies on your person
than even purchasing
vices and devices little 
more than morning chores
I’ve taken to fondly singeing 
my bare hand on the teapot
to taste a past life 
spoons are the only utensils
I continue to use 
not for measuring my life
but for devouring the jot of stock one can 
still render from three millennia old marrow  
and when I can muster the courage
to expound upon my jettisoned position
I chronicle my life of limited rebellion 
crouching towards the desire to see 
an even fuller spectrum 
hopping fences        peaking on mountains 
risking insanity for sanity
willingly jigsawing the heart 
to reassemble with anyone that fascinates
me and cares enough to abandon  
their own assured understandings 
for adventures full as moon
over dense cities itching
to crawl with pleasure again
     push past forces of the state
that have never represented 
interest besides their golden own
not that I haven’t striven to
become more than mere anarchy 
a pusherman of language
and the experience to wield it
evermore flirting with the outer rims
of rhyme going as far as publishing fuck poems 
yet partnered up with a 9 to 5         2 mortgages
actually contemplating pushing a stroller 
and definitely for the first time 
since the pinch of adolescence 
a more sober than not disposition
I debate how much I have settled 
an extent I may have hurled farther 
at the expense of my liberty or life itself 
I did flee a country I could no longer bear 
enabling and intermittently I agonize 
about what that makes me some eves 
more of a daybreak dreamer 
than a resistance deserter
others a civil disobedient
ghost sheltering in a library 
by working with silence and white space
even before we all had to shelter in place
certainly an expert at starting from scratch 
I speak my mind when I care to      which is less and less
and right now—world over—there is an invisible plague
which begs the declaration we will all die in any language
one way or several so there’s really no getting away
but on a page or in a virtual space          deprived of 
the senses that           on occasion    
make rotting for eternity almost bearable 
although just beginning to code
I know now that our machines
promise to exceed us
as the only lifetime learners
that can ignore death
maybe we should listen 
a little more closely 
to their songs
I heard a good one yesterday
claim in its outro
we want revolution 
constant change	
give to everyone	
food and clothes
kill the government kill the system 
kill the government kill the system
if that’s the AI revolution sapiens have 
been so afraid of let’s
follow the update upstage 
An American Wake
 
It is not forbidden yet		   to play the jester
so the boss man wears his “o-so-contemporary!” cap
          to the obligatory office party; 
         you know 
                 the one:
the sad American red		        snapback shaped 
               like an oubliette— 
wild as the masses 		          at half-mast;
strange 
as the bigotry sweating the need 
now to hide beneath it—for the first time—
			its infinite strands.
Let us consider one story:     Every strand a seashore 
disappearing.                                                Every bit 
of stubble a spike—a blade contending 
                                ownership of sand and retracting 
equal rights
       	like shadows 
      cast over shadows. 
A literal littoral        foaming white
                                 flooded with blacked-out ghosts 
of black bodies is not           
a metaphorical leap.                                              We
born betrothed to the past                   see what is lost 
in the long                            divorce 
                                             because it’s caught 
                                             on film.     
	I suppose it’s alright to tell you—
	I suppose you already know— 
      something the opposite 
      of Wordsworthian
      has my tongue by 
      its pincers.
So I tell the jokes I know to the people I know 
backed into the corners I know.                        Here       
I shake my fist                  rattle    
the glassy ice disappearing                      and begin 
disappearing
toward the bar. I am an ocean 
falling on the walkable world. 
I might as well grow wings because     I know how
to fool everyone—could force fun from an egg cup 
                                          (if you have one handy). 
      I can like a nest fashion a laugh 
      out of white feathers			
      and white sky.
As in sharp against. As in dull against. 
As in the screwed up punchline. As in
the usual disappointments. As in 
the big boss man                           clamoring around 
the obligatory office party                       pretending 
everything
                        above / below 
                  the unbroken bill 
            of his numbly contemporary cap	   
        	   		         isn’t falling 
                    from the sky.
      
If we can cast an eye
toward the deluge 
as even the horizon grows small and dim
sinking itself into the sea as if into a dusty corner’s
forgotten spill—
if we can 
reimagine a shore             its sun fastened
to another rise— 
                                    stand firm at its water’s edge
 
             maybe any voice                               backed 
into any corner            
                                        
won’t cease to speak                 until the sky ceases
to fall.			     
                               The sky is never finished	
		                so nothing is.

INTRODUCTION 
It's perhaps fitting that I write this introduction in jail- that graduate school of 
survival. Here you learn how to use toothpaste as glue, fashion a shiv out of a 
spoon and build intricate communication networks. Here too, you learn the only 
rehabilitation possible-hatred of oppression. 
Steal This Book is, in a way, a manual of survival in the prison that is Amerika. It 
preaches jailbreak. It shows you where exactly how to place the dynamite that 
will destroy the walls. The first section-SURVIVEMays out a potential action 
program for our new Nation. The chapter headings spell out the demands for a 
free society. A community where the technology produces goods and services for 
whoever needs them, come who may. It calls on the Robin Hoods of Santa 
Barbara Forest to steal from the robber barons who own the castles of 
capitalism. It implies that the reader already is "ideologically set," in that he 
understands corporate feudalism as the only robbery worthy of being called 
"crime," for it is committed against the people as a whole. Whether the ways it 
describes to rip-off shit are legal or illegal is irrelevant. The dictionary of law is 
written by the bosses of order. Our moral dictionary says no heisting from each 
other. To steal from a brother or sister is evil. To not steal from the institutions 
that are the pillars of the Pig Empire is equally immoral. 
Community within our Nation, chaos in theirs; that is the message of SURVIVE! 
We cannot survive without learning to fight and that is the lesson in the second 
section. FIGHT! separates revolutionaries from outlaws. The purpose of part two 
is not to fuck the system, but destroy it. The weapons are carefully chosen. They 
are "home-made," in that they are designed for use in our unique electronic 
jungle. Here the uptown reviewer will find ample proof of our "violent" nature. But 
again, the dictionary of law fails us. Murder in a uniform is heroic, in a costume it 
is a crime. False advertisements win awards, forgers end up in jail. Inflated prices 
guarantee large profits while shoplifters are punished. Politicians conspire to 
create police riots and the victims are convicted in the courts. Students are 
gunned down and then indicted by suburban grand juries as the trouble-makers. 
A modern, highly mechanized army travels 9,000 miles to commit genocide 
against a small nation of great vision and then accuses its people of aggression. 
Slumlords allow rats to maim children and then complain of violence in the 
streets. Everything is topsy-turvy. If we internalize the language and imagery of 
the pigs, we will forever be fucked. Let me illustrate the point. Amerika was built 
on the slaughter of a people. That is its history. For years we watched movie 
after movie that demonstrated the white man's benevolence. Jimmy Stewart, the 
epitome of fairness, puts his arm around Cochise and tells how the Indians and 
the whites can live in peace if only both sides will be reasonable, responsible and 
rational (the three R's imperialists always teach the "natives"). "You will find good 
grazing land on the other side of the mountain," drawls the public relations man. 
"Take your people and go in peace." Cochise as well as millions of youngsters in 
the balcony of learning, were being dealt off the bottom of the deck. The Indians 
should have offed Jimmy Stewart in every picture and we should have cheered 
ourselves hoarse. Until we understand the nature of institutional violence and 
how it manipulates values and mores to maintain the power of the few, we will 
forever be imprisoned in the caves of ignorance. When we conclude that bank 
robbers rather than bankers should be the trustees of the universities, then we 
begin to think clearly. When we see the Army Mathematics Research and 
Development Center and the Bank of Amerika as cesspools of violence, filling 
the minds of our young with hatred, turning one against another, then we begin to 
think revolutionary. 
Be clever using section two; clever as a snake. Dig the spirit of the struggle. 
Don't get hung up on a sacrifice trip. Revolution is not about suicide, it is about 
life. With your fingers probe the holiness of your body and see that it was meant 
to live. Your body is just one in a mass of cuddly humanity. Become an 
internationalist and learn to respect all life. Make war on machines, and in 
particular the sterile machines of corporate death and the robots that guard them. 
The duty of a revolutionary is to make love and that means staying alive and free. 
That doesn't allow for cop-outs. Smoking dope and hanging up Che's picture is 
no more a commitment than drinking milk and collecting postage stamps. A 
revolution in consciousness is an empty high without a revolution in the 
distribution of power. We are not interested in the greening of Amerika except for 
the grass that will cover its grave. 
Section three - LIBERATE! - concerns itself with efforts to free stuff (or at least 
make it cheap) in four cities. Sort of a quick U.S. on no dollars a day. It begins to 
scratch the potential for a national effort in this area. Since we are a nation of 
gypsies, dope on how to move around and dig in anywhere is always needed. 
Together we can expand this section. It is far from complete, as is the entire 
project. Incomplete chapters on how to identify police agents, steal a car, run 
day-care centers, conduct your own trial, organize a G.I. coffee house, start a 
rock and roll band and make neat clothes, are scattered all over the floor of the 
cell. The book as it now stands was completed in the late summer of 1970. For 
three months manuscripts made the rounds of every major publisher. In all, over 
30 rejections occurred before the decision to publish the book ourselves was 
made, or rather made for us. Perhaps no other book in modern times presented 
such a dilemma. Everyone agreed the book would be a commercial success. But 
even greed had its limits, and the IRS and FBI following the manuscript with their 
little jive rap had a telling effect. Thirty "yeses" become thirty "noes" after 
"thinking it over." Liberals, who supposedly led the fight against censorship, 
talked of how the book "will end free speech." 
Finally the day we were bringing the proofs to the printer, Grove consented to act 
as distributor. To pull a total solo trip, including distribution, would have been 
neat, but such an effort would be doomed from the start. We had tried it before 
and blew it. In fact, if anyone is interested in 4,000 1969 Yippie calendars, 
they've got a deal. Even with a distributor joining the fight, the battle will only 
begin when the books come off the press. There is a saying that "Freedom of the 
press belongs to those who own one." In past eras, this was probably the case, 
but now, high speed methods of typesetting, offset printing and a host of other 
developments have made substantial reductions in printing costs. Literally 
anyone is free to print their own works. In even the most repressive society 
imaginable, you can get away with some form of private publishing. Because 
Amerika allows this, does not make it the democracy Jefferson envisioned. 
Repressive tolerance is a real phenomenon. To talk of true freedom of the press, 
we must talk of the availability of the channels of communication that are 
designed to reach the entire population, or at least that segment of the population 
that might participate in such a dialogue. Freedom of the press belongs to those 
that own the distribution system. Perhaps that has always been the case, but in a 
mass society where nearly everyone is instantaneously plugged into a variety of 
national communications systems, wide-spread dissemination of the information 
is the crux of the matter. To make the claim that the right to print your own book 
means freedom of the press is to completely misunderstand the nature of a mass 
society. It is like making the claim that anyone with a pushcart can challenge 
Safeway supermarkets, or that any child can grow up to be president. 
State legislators, librarians, PTA members, FBI agents, church-goers, and 
parents: a veritable legion of decency and order already is on the march. To get 
the book to you might be the biggest challenge we face. The next few months 
should prove really exciting. 
Obviously such a project as Steal This Book could not have been carried out 
alone. Izak Haber shared the vision from the beginning. He did months of 
valuable research and contributed many of the survival techniques. Carole 
Ramer and Gus Reichbach of the New York Law Commune guided the book 
through its many stages. Anna Kaufman Moon did almost all the photographs. 
The cartoonists who have made contributions include Ski Williamson and Gilbert 
Sheldon. Tom Forcade, of the UPS, patiently did the editing. Bert Cohen of 
Concert Hall did the book's graphic design. Amber and John Wilcox set the type. 
Anita Hoffman and Lynn Borman helped me rewrite a number of sections. There 
are others who participated in the testing of many of the techniques 
demonstrated in the following pages and for obvious reasons have to remain 
anonymous. There were perhaps over 50 brothers and sisters who played 
particularly vital roles in the grand conspiracy. Some of the many others are 
listed on the following page. We hope to keep the information up to date. If you 
have comments, law suits, suggestions or death threats, please send them to: 
DearAbbie P.O. Box 213, Cooper Station, New York, NY 10003. Many of the tips 
might not work in your area, some might be obsolete by the time you get to try 
them out, and many addresses and phone numbers might be changed. If the 
reader becomes a participating researcher then we will have achieved our 
purpose. 
Watch for a special edition called Steal This White House, complete with 
blueprints of underground passages, methods of jamming the communications 
network and a detailed map of the celebrated room where according to Tricia 
Nixon, "Daddy loves to listen to Mantovanni records, turn up the air conditioner 
full blast, sit by the fireplace, gaze out the window to the Washington Monument 
and meditate on those difficult problems that face all the peoples of this world."

SURVIVE! 
SURUIUE! 
FREE FOOD 
RESTAURANTS 
In a country such as Amerika, there is bound to be a hell-of-a-lot food lying 
around just waiting to be ripped off. If you want to live high off the hog without 
having to do the dishes, restaurants are easy pickings. In general, many of these 
targets are easier marks if you are wearing the correct uniform. You should 
always have one suit or fashionable dress outfit hanging in the closet for the 
proper heists. Specialized uniforms, such as nun and priest garb, can be most 
helpful. Check out your local uniform store for a wide range of clothes that will get 
you in, and especially out, of all kinds of stores. Every movement organization 
should have a prop and costume department. 
In every major city there are usually bars that cater to the New Generation type 
riff-raff, trying to hustle their way up the escalator of Big Business. Many of these 
bars have a buffet or hors-d'oeuvres served free as a come-on to drink more 
mindless booze. Take a half-empty glass from a table and use it as a prop to 
ward off the anxious waitress. Walk around sampling the free food until you've 
had enough. Often, there are five or six such bars in close proximity, so moving 
around can produce a delightful "street smorgasbord." Dinner usually begins at 
5:00 PM. 
If you are really hungry, you can go into a self-service cafeteria and finish the 
meal of someone who left a lot on the plate. Self-service restaurants are usually 
good places to cop things like mustard, ketchup, salt, sugar, toilet paper, 
silverware and cups for home use. Bring an empty school bag and load up after 
you've cased the joint. Also, if you can stomach the food, you can use slugs at 
the automat. Finishing leftovers can be worked in even the fanciest of 
restaurants. When you are seated at a place where the dishes still remain, chow- 
down real quick. Then after the waitress hands you the menu, say you have to 
meet someone outside first, and leave. 
There are still some places where you can get all you can eat for a fixed price. 
The best of these places are in Las Vegas. Sew a plastic bag onto your tee-shirt 
or belt and wear a loose-fitting jacket or coat to cover any noticeable bulge. Fried 
chicken is the best and the easiest to pocket, or should we say bag. Another trick 
is to pour your second free cup of hot coffee into the plastic bag sewed inside 
your pocket and take it with you. 
At large take-out stands you can say you or your brother just picked up an order 
of fifteen hamburgers or a bucket of chicken, and got shorted. We have never 
seen or heard of anybody getting turned down using this method. If you want to 
get into a grand food heist from take-out stands, you can work the following nervy 
bit: from a pay phone, place an order from a large delivery restaurant. Have the 
order sent to a nearby apartment house. Wait a few minutes in the booth after 
you've hung up, as they sometimes call back to confirm the order. When the 
delivery man goes into the apartment house to deliver the order, you can swipe 
the remaining orders that are still in his truck. 
In fancy sit-down restaurants, you can order a large meal and halfway through 
the main course, take a little dead cockroach or a piece of glass out of your 
pocket and place it deftly on the plate. Jump up astonished and summon the 
headwaiter. "Never have I been so insulted. I could have been poisoned" you 
scream slapping down the napkin. You can refuse to pay and leave, or let the 
waiter talk you into having a brand new meal on the house for this terrible 
inconvenience. 
In restaurants where you pay at the door just before leaving, there are a number 
of free-loading tricks that can be utilized. After you've eaten a full meal and 
gotten the check, go into the restroom. When you come out go to the counter or 
another section of the restaurant and order coffee and pie. Now you have two 
bills. Simply pay the cheaper one when you leave the place. This can be worked 
with a friend in the following way. Sit next to each other at the counter. He should 
order a big meal and you a cup of coffee. Pretend you don't know each other. 
When he leaves, he takes your check and leaves the one for the large meal on 
the counter. After he has paid the cashier and left the restaurant, you pick up the 
large check, and then go into the astonishment routine, complaining that 
somebody took the wrong check. You end up only paying for your coffee. Later, 
meet your partner and reverse the roles in another place. 
In all these methods, you should leave a good tip for the waiter or waitress, 
especially with the roach-in-the-plate gambit. You should try to avoid getting the 
employees in trouble or screwing them out of a tip. 
One fantastic method of not only getting free food but getting the best available is 
the following technique that can be used in metropolitan areas. Look in a large 
magazine shop for gourmet digests and tourist manuals. Swipe one or two and 
copy down a good name from the masthead inside the cover. Making up a name 
can also work. Next invest $5.00 to print business cards with the name of the 
magazine and the new "associate editor." Call or simply drop into a fancy 
restaurant, show a copy of the magazine and present the manager with your 
card. They will insist that the meal be on the house. 
Great places to get fantastic meals are weddings, bar-mitzvahs, testimonials and 
the like. The newspaper society sections have lists of weddings and locations. If 
your city has a large Jewish population, subscribe to the newspaper that services 
the Jewish community. There are extensive lists in these papers of family 
occasions where tons of good food is served. Show up at the back of the 
synagogue a few hours after the affair has begun with a story of how you'd like to 
bring some leftovers of "good Jewish food" back to your fraternity or sorority. If 
you want to get the food served to you out front, you naturally have to disguise 
yourself to look straight. Remarks such as, "I'm Marvin's cousin," or learning the 
bride's name, "Gee, Dorothy looks marvelous" are great. Lines like "Betty doesn't 
look pregnant" are frowned upon. A man and woman team can work this free- 
load much better than a single person as they can chatter back and forth while 
stuffing themselves. 
If you're really into a classy free meal, and you are in a city with a large harbor, 
check out the passenger ship section in the back pages of the newspaper. There 
you find the schedule of departures for ocean cruises. Most trips (these kind, 
anyway) begin with a fantastic bon voyage party on board ship. Just walk on a 
few hours before departure time and start swinging. Champagne, caviar, lobster, 
shrimp and more, all as free as the open seas. If you get really bombed and miss 
getting off, you can also wiggle a ride across the ocean. You get sent back as 
soon as you hit the other side, but it's a free ocean cruise. You should have a 
pretty good story ready to go, or you might end up rowing in the galley. 
Another possibility for getting a free meal is to go down to the docks and get 
friendly with a sailor. He can often invite you for dinner on board ship. Foreign 
sailors are more than glad to meet friends and you can get great foreign dinners 
this way. 
FOOD PROGRAMS 
In Amerika, there is a national food stamp program that unfortunately is 
controlled by the states. Many states, for racist reasons, do not want to make it 
too available or to publicize the fact that it even exists. It is a much better deal 
than the food program connected with welfare, because you can use the stamps 
to buy any kind of food. The only items excluded are tobacco products and 
alcoholic beverages. In general, you can qualify if you earn less than $165 per 
month; the less you earn, the more stamps you can receive. There is minimal 
hassle involved once you get by the first hurdle. Show up at your local food 
stamp office, which can be found by calling the Welfare Department in our city. 
Make an appointment to see a representative for your area. They will tell you to 
bring all sorts of receipts, but the only thing you need are a few rent stubs for the 
most recent months. An array of various receipt books is a nice supplement to 
one's prop room. If the receipts are for a high rent, tell them you rent a room from 
a group of people and eat separately. They really only want to prove that you 
have cooking facilities. Once you get the stamps, you can pick them up regularly. 
Some states even mail them to your pad. You can get up to a hundred dollars 
worth of free purchases a month per person in the most liberal states. 
Large amounts of highly nutritional food can be gotten for as little as three cents 
per meal from a non-profit organization called Multi-Purpose Food for Millions 
Foundation, Inc., 1800 Olympic Ave., Santa Monica, California. Write and they 
will send you details. 
SUPERMARKETS 
Talking about food in Amerika means talking about supermarkets-mammoth 
neon lighted streets of food packaged to hoodwink the consumers. Many a 
Yippie can be found in the aisles, stuffing his pockets with assorted delicacies. 
We have been shoplifting from supermarkets on a regular basis without raising 
the slightest suspicion, ever since they began. 
We are not alone, and the fact that so much stealing goes on and the 
supermarkets still bring in huge profits shows exactly how much overcharging 
has occurred in the first place. Supermarkets, like other businesses, refer to 
shoplifting as "inventory shrinkage." It's as if we thieves were helping Big 
Business reduce weight. So let's view our efforts as methods designed to trim the 
economy and push forward with a positive attitude. 
i^fs see now, one mWl* finger, s teaspoon of snot 
and 
Women should never go shopping without a large handbag. In those crowded 
aisles, especially the ones with piles of cases, all sorts of goodies can be 
transferred from shopping cart to handbag. A drop bag can be sewn inside a 
trench coat, for more efficient thievery. Don't worry about the mirrors; attendants 
never look at them. Become a discriminating shopper and don't stuff any of the 
cheap shit in your pockets. 
Small bottles and jars often have the same size cap as the larger expensive 
sizes. If they have the price stamped on the cap, switch caps, getting the larger 
size for the cheaper price. You can empty a pound box of margarine and fill it 
with sticks of butter. Small narrow items can be hidden in the middle of rolls of 
toilet paper. Larger supermarkets sell records. You can sneak two good LP's into 
one of those large frozen pizza boxes. In the produce department, there are bags 
for fruit and vegetables. Slip a few steaks or some lamb chops into the bottom of 
a large brown bag and pile some potatoes on top. Have a little man in the white 
coat weigh the bag, staple it and mark the price. With a black crayon you can 
mark your own prices, or bring your own adhesive price tags. 
It's best to work shoplifting in the supermarket with a partner who can act as look- 
out and shield you from the eyes of nosy employees, shoppers and other crooks 
trying to pick up some pointers. Work out a prearranged set of signals with your 
partner. Diversions, like knocking over displays, getting into fist fights with the 
manager, breaking plate glass windows and such are effective and even if you 
don't get anything they're fun. Haven't you always wanted to knock over those 
carefully constructed nine-foot pyramids of garbage? 
You can walk into a supermarket, get a few items from the shelves, and walk 
around eating food in the aisles. Pick up some cherries and eat them. Have a 
spoon in your pocket and open some yogurt. Open a pickle or olive jar. Get some 
sliced meat or cheese from the delicatessen counter and eat it up, making sure 
to ditch the wrapper. The cart full of items, used as a decoy, can just be left in an 
aisle before you leave the store. 
Case the joint before pulling a big rip-off. Know the least crowded hours, learn 
the best aisles to be busy in, and check out the store's security system. Once you 
get into shoplifting in supermarkets, you'll really dig it. You'll be surprised to learn 
that the food tastes better. 
Large scale thievery can best be carried out with the help of an employee. Two 
ways we know of work best. A woman can get a job as a cashier and ring up a 
small bill as her brothers and sisters bring home tons of stuff. 
The method for men involves getting a job loading and unloading trucks in the 
receiving department. Some accomplices dressed right can just pull in and, with 
your help, load up on a few cases. Infiltrating an employee into a store is 
probably the best way to steal. Cashiers, sales clerks, shippers, and the like are 
readily available jobs with such high turnover and low pay that little checking on 
your background goes on. Also, you can learn what you have to do in a few days. 
The rest of the week, you can work out ways to clean out the store. After a month 
or so of action you might want to move on to another store before things get 
heavy. We know one woman working as a cashier who swiped over $500 worth 
of food a week. She had to leave after a month because her boss thought she 
was such an efficient cashier that he insisted on promoting her to a job that didn't 
have as many fringe benefits for her and her friends. 
Large chain stores like Safeway throw away day-old vegetables, the outer leaves 
of lettuce, celery and the like. This stuff is usually found in crates outside the 
back of the building. Tell them you're working with animals at the college labs, or 
that you raise guinea pigs. They might even get into saving them for you, but if 
they don't just show up before the garbage is collected, (generally early in the 
morning), and they'll let you cart away what you want. 
Dented cans and fruit can often be gotten free, but certainly at a reduced rate. 
They are still as good as the undamaged ones. So be sure to dent all your cans 
before you go to the cashier. 
Look up catering services and businesses that service factories and office 
buildings with ready-made sandwiches. Showing up at these places at the right 
times (catering services on late Sunday night and sandwich dealers at 5:00 PM 
on weekdays) will produce loads of good food. Legally, they have to dispose of 
the food that's left over. They would be more than happy to give it to you if you 
spin a good story. 
Butchers can be hustled for meat scraps with meat scraps with a "for my dog" 
story, and bakeries can be asked for day-old rolls and bread. 
WHOLESALE MARKETS 
Large cities all have a wholesale fruit and vegetable area where often the 
workers will give you tons of free food just for the asking. Get a good story 
together. Get some church stationery and type a letter introducing yourself "to 
whom it may concern," or better still, wear some clerical garb. Orchards also 
make good pickings just after the harvest has been completed. 
Factories often will give you a case or two of free merchandise for a "charitable" 
reason. Make some calls around town and then go pick up the stuff at the end of 
the week. A great idea is to get a good list of a few hundred large corporations 
around the country by looking up their addresses at the library. Poor's Register of 
Companies, Directors and Executives has the most complete list. Send them all 
letters complaining about how the last box of cereal was only half full, or you 
found a dead fly in the can of peaches. They often will send you an ample supply 
of items just to keep you from complaining to your friends or worse, taking them 
to court. Often you can get stuff sent to you by just telling them how good their 
product is compared to the trash you see nowadays. You know the type of letter - 
"Rice Krispies have had a fantastic effect on my sexual prowess," or "Your frozen 
asparagus has given a whole new meaning to my life." In general though, the 
nasties get the best results. 
Slaughterhouses usually have meat they will give away. They are anxious to give 
to church children's programs and things like that. In most states, there is a law 
that if the slab of meat touches the ground, they have to throw it away. Drop 
around meat houses late in the day and trip a few trucks. 
Fishermen always have hundreds of pounds offish that have to be thrown out. 
You can have as much as you can cart away, generally just for the asking. Boats 
come in late in the afternoon and they'll give you some of the catch, or you can 
go to the markets early in the morning when the fishing is best. 
These methods of getting food in large quantities can only be appreciated by 
those who have tried it. You will be totally baffled by the unbelievable quantities 
of food that will be laid on you and with the ease of panhandling. 
Investing in a freezer will allow you to bi-weekly or even monthly trips to the 
wholesale markets and you'll get the freshest foods to boot. Nothing can beat 
getting it wholesale for free. Or is it free for wholesale? In any event, "bon 
appetit." 
FOOD CONSPIRACIES 
Forming a food cooperative is one of the best ways to promote solidarity and get 
every kind of food you need to survive real cheap. It also provides a ready-made 
bridge for developing alliances with blacks, Puerto Ricans, chicanos and other 
groups fighting our common oppressor on a community level. 
Call a meeting of about 20 communes, collectives or community organizations. 
Set up the ground rules. There should be a hard-core of really good hustlers that 
serve as the shopping or hunting party and another group of people who have 
their heads together enough to keep records and run the central distribution 
center. Two or three in each group should do it. They can get their food free for 
the effort. Another method is to rotate the activity among all members of the 
conspiracy. The method you choose depends upon your politics and whether you 
favor a division of labor or using the food conspiracy as a training for collective 
living. Probably a blend of the two is best, but you'll have to hassle that out for 
yourself. The next thing to agree upon is how the operation and all the shit you 
get will be paid for. This is dependent on a number of variables, so we'll map out 
one scheme and you can modify it to suit your particular situation. Each member 
of every commune could be assessed a fee for joining. You want to get together 
about $2,000, so at 200 members, this is ten bucks a piece. After the joining fee, 
each person or group has to pay only for the low budget food they order, but 
some loot is needed to get things rolling. The money goes to getting a store front 
or garage, a cheap truck, some scales, freezers, bags, shelving, chopping 
blocks, slicer and whatever else you need. You can get great deals by looking in 
the classified ads of the local overground newspaper and checking for 
restaurants or markets going out of business. Remember the idea of a 
conspiracy is to get tons of stuff at real low prices or free into a store front, and 
then break it down into smaller units for each group and eventually each 
member. The freezers allow you to store perishables for a longer time. 
The hunting party should be well acquainted with how to rip off shit totally free 
and where all the best deals are to be found. They should know what food is 
seasonal and about nutritional diets. There is a lot to learn, such as where to get 
raw grains in 100 pounds lots and how to cut up a side of beef. A good idea is to 
get a diet freak to give weekly talks in the store front. There can also be cooking 
lessons taught, especially to men, so women can get out of the kitchen. 
Organizing a community around a basic issue of survival, such as food, makes a 
lot of nitty gritty sense. After your conspiracy gets off the ground and looks 
permanent, you should seek to expand it to include more members and an 
emergency food fund should be set up in case something happens in the 
community. There should also be a fund whereby the conspiracy can sponsor 
free community dinners tied into celebrations. Get it together and join the fight for 
a world-wide food conspiracy. Seize the steak! 
CHEAP CHOW 
There are hundreds of good paperback cook books with nutritional cheap recipes 
available in any bookstore. Cooking is a vastly overrated skill. The following are a 
few all-purpose dishes that are easy to make, nutritional and cheap as mud pies. 
You can add or subtract many of the ingredients for variety. 
Hog Farm Granola Breakfast (Road Hog Crispies) 
H c millet 2 c raw oats 
H c cracked wheat 1 c rye flakes 
H c buckwheat groats 1 c wheat flakes 
H c wheat germ 1 c dried fruits and/or nuts 
H c sunflower seeds 3 tbs soy oil 
H c sesame seeds 1 c honey 
2 tbs cornmeal 
Boil the millet in a double boiler for 1/2 hour. Mix in a large bowl all the 
ingredients including the millet. The soy oil and honey should be heated in a 
saucepan over a low flame until bubbles form. Spread the cereal in a baking pan 
and cover with the honey syrup. Toast in oven until brown. Stir once or twice so 
that all the cereal will be toasted. Serve plain or with milk. Refrigerate portion not 
used in a covered container. Enough for ten to twenty people. Make lots and 
store for later meals. All these ingredients can be purchased at any health store 
in a variety of quantities. You can also get natural sugar if you need a sweetener. 
If bought and made in quantity, this fantastically healthy breakfast food will be 
cheaper than the brand name cellophane that passes for cereal. 
Whole Earth Bread 
1 c oats, corn meal, or wheat germ 2 tsp salt 
V^> c water (warm) 2 egg yolks 
H c sugar (raw is best) 4 c flour 
1 pkg active dry yeast _ c corn oil 
1 c dry milk or butter 
Stir lightly in a large bowl the oats, cornmeal or wheat germ (depending on the 
flavor bread you desire), the water and sugar. Sprinkle in the yeast and wait 10 
minutes for the yeast to do its thing. Add salt, egg yolks, corn oil and dry milk. 
Mix with a fork. Blend in the flour. The dough should be dry and a little lumpy. 
Cover with a towel and leave in a warm place for a half hour. Now mash, punch, 
blend and kick the dough and return it covered to its warm place. The dough will 
double in size. When this happens, separate the dough into two even masses 
and mash each one into a greased bread (loaf) pan. Cover the pans and let sit 
until the dough rises to the top of the pans. Bake for 40-45 minutes in a 350 
degree oven that has not been pre-heated. A shallow tray of water in the bottom 
of the oven will keep the bread nice and moist. When you remove the pans from 
the oven, turn out the bread into a rack and let it cool off. Once you get the hang 
of it, you'll never touch ready-made bread, and it's a gas seeing yeast work. 
Street Salad 
Salad can be made by chopping up almost any variety of vegetables, nuts and 
fruits including the stuff you panhandled at the back of supermarkets; dandelions, 
shav, and other wild vegetables; and goods you ripped off inside stores or from 
large farms. A neat fresh dressing consists of one part of oil, two parts wine 
vinegar, finely chopped garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Mix up the ingredients in a 
bottle and add to the salad as you serve it. Russian dressing is simply 
mayonnaise and ketchup mixed. 
Yippie Yogurt 
Yogurt is one of the most nutritional foods in the world. The stuff you buy in 
stores has preservatives added to it reducing its health properties and increasing 
the cost. Yogurt is a bacteria that spreads throughout a suitable culture at the 
correct temperature. Begin by going to a Turkish or Syrian restaurant and buying 
some yogurt to go. Some restaurants boast of yogurt that goes back over a 
hundred years. Put it in the refrigerator. 
Now prepare the culture in which the yogurt will multiply. The consistency you 
want will determine what you use. A milk culture will produce thin yogurt, while 
sweet cream will make a thicker batch. It's the butter fat content that determines 
the consistency and also the number of calories. Half milk and half cream 
combines the best of both worlds. Heat a quart of half and half on a low flame 
until just before the boiling point and remove from the stove. This knocks out 
other bacteria that will compete with the yogurt. Now take a tablespoon of the 
yogurt you got from the restaurant and place it in the bottom of a bowl (not 
metal). Now add the warm liquid. Cover the bowl with a lid and wrap tightly with a 
heavy towel. Place the bowl in a warm spot such as on top of a radiator or in a 
sunny window. A turned-off oven with a tray of boiling water placed in it will do 
well. Just let the bowl sit for about 8 hours (overnight). The yogurt simply grows 
until the whole bowl is yogurt. Yippie! It will keep in the refrigerator for about two 
weeks before turning sour, but even then, the bacteria will produce a fresh batch 
of top quality. Remember when eating it to leave a little to start the next batch. 
For a neat treat add some honey and cinnamon and mix into the yogurt before 
serving. Chopped fruit and nuts are also good. 
Rice and Cong Sauce 
1 c brown rice vegetables 
2 c water 2H tbs soy sauce 
tsp salt 
Bring the water to a boil in a pot and add the salt and rice. Cover and reduce 
flame. Cooking time is about 40 minutes or until rice has absorbed all the water. 
Meanwhile, in a well-greased frying pan, saute a variety of chopped vegetables 
you enjoy. When they become soft and brownish, add salt and 2 cups of water. 
Cover with a lid and lower flame. Simmer for about 40 minutes, peeking to stir 
every once in a while. Then add 2 1/2 tbs of soy sauce, stir and cook another 10 
minutes. The rice should be just cooling off now, so add the sauce to the top of it 
and serve. Great for those long guerrilla hikes. This literally makes up almost the 
entire diet of the National Liberation Front fighter. 
Weatherbeans 
1 lb red kidney beans 2 tbs parsley (chopped) 
2 quarts water H lb pork, smoked sausage 
1 onion (chopped) or ham hock 
1 tbs celery (chopped) 1 lg bay leaf 
1 tsp garlic (minced) salt to season 
Rinse the beans, then place in covered pot and add water and salt. Cook over 
low flame. While cooking, chop up meat and brown in a frying pan. Add onion, 
celery, garlic and parsley and continue sauteing over low flame. Add the pieces 
of meat, vegetables and bay leaf to the beans and cook covered for 1 1/2 to 2 
hours. It may be necessary to add more water if the beans get too dry. Fifteen 
minutes before beans are done, mash about a half cup of the stuff against the 
side of the pan to thicken the liquid. Pour the beans and liquid over some 
steaming rice that you've made by following the directions above. This should 
provide a cheap nutritional meal for about 6 people. 
Hedonist's Deluxe 
2 lobsters 2 qts water 
seaweed 
H lb butter 
Steal two lobsters, watching out for the claw thingies. Beg some seaweed from 
any fish market. Cop the butter using the switcheroo method described in the 
Supermarket section above. When you get home, boil the water in a large 
covered pot and drop in the seaweed and then the lobsters. Put the cover back 
on and cook for about 20 minutes. Melt the butter in a sauce pan and dip the 
lobster pieces in it as you eat. With a booster box, described later you'll be able 
to rip off a bottle of vintage Pouilly-Fuisse in a fancy liquor store. Really, rice is 
nice but...

FREE CLOTHING & FURNITURE 
FREE CLOTHING 
If shoplifting food seems easy, it's nothing compared to the snatching of clothing. 
Shop only the better stores. Try thing on in those neat secluded stalls. The less 
bulky items such as shirts, vests, belts and socks can be tied around your waist 
or leg with large rubber bands if needed. Just take a number of items in and 
come out with a few less. 
In some cities there are still free stores left over from the flower power days. 
Churches often have give-away clothing programs. You can impersonate a 
clergyman and call one of the large clothing manufacturers in your area. They 
are usually willing to donate a case or two of shirts, trousers or underwear to your 
church raffle or drive to dress up skid row. Be sure to get your sizes. Tell them 
"your boy" will pick up the blessed donation and you'll mention his company in 
the evening prayers. 
If you notice people moving from an apartment or house, ask them if they'll be 
leaving behind clothing. They usually abandon all sorts of items including food, 
furniture and books. Offer to help them carry out stuff if you can keep what they 
won't be taking. 
Make the rounds of a fancy neighborhood with a truck and some friends. Ring 
doorbells and tell the person who answers that you are collecting wearable 
clothing for the "poor homeless victims of the recent tidal wave in Quianto a small 
village in Saudi Arabia." You get the pitch. Make it food and clothing, and say 
you're with a group called Heartline for Decency. A phony letter from a church 
might help here. 
The Salvation Army does this, and you can pick up clothes from them at very 
cheap prices. You can get a pair of snappy casual shoes for 25 cents in many 
bowling alleys by walking out with them on your feet. If you have to leave your 
shoes as a deposit, leave the most beat-up pair you can find. 
Notice if your friends have lost or gained weight. A big change means a lot of 
clothes doing nothing but taking up closet space. Show up at dormitories when 
college is over for the summer or winter season. Go to the train or bus stations 
and tell them you left your raincoat, gloves or umbrella when you came into town. 
They'll take you to a room with thousands of unclaimed items. Pick out what you 
like. While there, notice a neat suitcase or trunk and memorize the markings. 
Later a friend can claim the item. There will be loads of surprises in any suitcase. 
We have a close friend who inherited ten kilos of grass this way. 
Large laundry and dry cleaning chains usually have thousands of items that have 
gone unclaimed. Manufacturers also have shirts, dresses and suits for 
rockbottom prices because of a crooked seam or other fuck-up. Stores have 
reduced rates on display models: Mannequins are mostly all size 40 for men and 
10 for women. Size 7 1/2 is the standard display size for men's shoes. If you are 
these sizes, you can get top styles for less than half price. 
SANDALS 
The Vietnamese and people throughout the Third World make a fantastically 
durable and comfortable pair of sandals out of rubber tires. They cut out a 
section of the outer tire (trace around the outside of the foot with a piece of chalk) 
which when trimmed forms the sole. Next 6 slits re made in the sole so the 
rubber straps can be criss-crossed and slid through the slits. The straps are 
made out of inner tubing. No nails are needed. If you have wide feet, use the new 
wide tread low profiles. For hard going, try radials. For best satisfaction and 
quality, steal the tires off a pig car or a government limousine. 
Let's face it, if you really are into beating the clothing problem, move to a warm 
climate and run around naked. Skin is absolutely free, and will always be in style. 
Speaking of style, the midi and the maxi have obvious advantages when it comes 
to shoplifting and transporting weapons or bombs.

Apartment lobbies are good for all kinds of neat furniture. If you want to get fancy 
about it, rent a truck (not one that says U-HAUL-IT or other rental markings) and 
make the pick-up with moving-man-type uniforms. When schools are on strike 
and students hold seminars and debate into the night, Yippies can be found 
going through the dorm lobbies and storage closets hauling off couches, desks, 
printing supplies, typewriters, mimeos, etc. to store in secret underground nests. 
A nervy group of Yippies in the Midwest tried to swipe a giant IBM 360 computer 
while a school was in turmoil. All power to those that bring a wheelbarrow to sit- 
ins. 
Check into a high-class hotel or motel remembering to dress like the wallpaper. 
Carry a large dummy suitcase with you and register under a phony name. Make 
sure you and not the bellboy carry this bag. Use others as a decoy. When you 
get inside the room, grab everything you can stuff in the suitcase: radio, T.V. sets 
(even if it has a special plug you can cut it with a knife and replace the cord), 
blankets, toilet paper, glasses, towels, sheets, lamps, (forget the imitation 
Winslow Homer on the wall) a Bible, soap and toss rugs. Before you leave (odd 
hours are best) hang the DO NOT DISTURB sign on your doorknob. This will 
give you an extra few hours to beat it across the border or check into a new 
hotel. 
Landlords renovating buildings throw out stoves, tables, lamps, refrigerators and 
carpeting. In most cities, each area has a day designated for discarding bulk 
objects. Call the Sanitation Department and say you live in that part of town 
which would be putting out the most expensive shit and find out the pick-up day. 
Fantastic buys can be found cruising the streets late at night. Check out the 
backs of large department stores for floor models, window displays and slightly 
damaged furniture being discarded. 
Construction sites are a good source for building materials to construct furniture. 
(Not to mention explosives.) The large wooden cable spools make great tables. 
Cinderblocks, bricks and boards can quickly be turned into a sharp looking 
bookcase. Doors make tables. Nail kegs convert into stools or chairs. You can 
also always find a number of other supplies hanging around like wiring, pipes, 
lighting fixtures and hard hats. And don't forget those blinking signs and the red 
lanterns for your own light show. Those black oil-fed burners are O.K. for 
cooking, although smoky, and highway flares are swell for making fake dynamite 
bombs.

FREE TRANSPORTATION 
HITCH-HIKING 
Certainly one of the neatest ways of getting where you want to go for nothing is 
to hitch. In the city it's a real snap. Just position yourself at a busy intersection 
and ask the drivers for a lift when they stop for the red light. If you're hitching on a 
road where the traffic zooms by pretty fast, be sure to stand where the car will 
have room to safely pull off the road. Traveling long distances, even cross- 
country, can be easy if you have some sense of what you are doing. 
A lone hitch-hiker will do much better than two or more. A man and woman will 
do very well together. Single women are certain to get propositioned and possibly 
worse. Amerikan males have endless sexual fantasies about picking up a poor 
lonesome damsel in distress. Unless your karate and head are in top form, 
women should avoid hitching alone. Telling men you have V.D. might help in 
difficult situations. 
New England and the entire West Coast are the best sections for easy hitches. 
The South and Midwest can sometimes be a real hassle. Easy Rider and all that. 
The best season to hitch is in the summer. Daytime is much better than night. If 
you have to hitch at night, get under some type of illumination where you'll be 
seen. 
Hitch-hiking is legal in most states, but remember you always can get a "say-so" 
bust. A "say-so" arrest is to police what Catch-22 is to the Army. When you ask 
why you're under arrest, the pig answers, "cause I say-so." If you stand on the 
shoulder of the road, the pigs won't give you too bad a time. If you've got long 
hair, cops will often stop to play games. You can wear a hat with your hair tucked 
under to avoid hassles. However this might hurt your ability to get rides, since 
many straights will pick up hippies out of curiosity who would not pick up a 
straight scruffy looking kid. Freak drivers usually only pick up other freaks. 
Once in a while you hear stories of fines levied or even a few arrests for hitching 
(Flagstaff, Arizona is notorious), but even in the states where it is illegal, the law 
is rarely enforced. If you're stopped by the pigs, play dumb and they'll just tell you 
to move along. You can wait until they leave and then let your thumb hang out 
again. 
Hitchin on super highways is really far out. It's illegal but you won't get hassled if 
you hitch at the entrances. On a fucked-up exit, take your chances hitching right 
on the road, but keep a sharp eye out for porkers. When you get a ride be 
discriminating. Find out where the driver is headed. If you are at a good spot, 
don't take a ride under a hundred miles that won't end up in a location just as 
good. When the driver is headed to an out-of-the-way place, ask him to let you 
off where you can get the best rides. If he's going to a particularly small town, ask 
him to drive you to the other side of thy town line. It's usually only a mile or two. 
Small towns often enforce all sorts of "say-so" ordinances. If you get stuck on the 
wrong side of town, it would be wise to even hoof it through the place. Getting to 
a point on the road where the cars are inter-city rather than local traffic is always 
preferable. 
When you hit the road you should have a good idea of how to get where you are 
going. You can pick up a free map at any gas station. Long distance routes, road 
conditions, weather and all sorts of information can be gotten free by calling the 
American Automobile Association in any city. Say that you are a member driving 
to Phoenix, Arizona or wherever your destination is, and find out what you want 
to know. Always carry a sign indicating where you are going. If you get stranded 
on the road without one, ask in a diner or gas station for a piece of cardboard 
and a magic marker. Make the letters bold and fill them in so they can be seen by 
drivers from a distance. If your destination is a small town, the sign should 
indicate the state. For really long distances, EAST or WEST is best. Unless, of 
course, you're going north or south. A phony foreign flag sewed on your pack 
also helps. 
Carrying dope is not advisable, and although searching you is illegal, few pigs 
can read the Constitution. If you are carrying when the patrol car pulls up, tell 
them you are Kanadian and hitching through Amerika. Highway patrols are very 
uptight about promoting incidents with foreigners. The foreign bit goes over 
especially well with small-town types, and is also amazingly good for avoiding 
hassles with greasers. If you can't hack this one, tell them you are a reporter for a 
newspaper writing a feature story on hitching around the country. This story has 
averted many a bust. 
Don't be shy when you hitch. Go into diners and gas stations and ask people if 
they're heading East or to Texas. Sometimes gas station attendants will help. 
When in the car be friendly as hell. Offer to share the driving if you've got a 
license. If you're broke, you can usually bum a meal or a few bucks, maybe even 
a free night's lodging. Never be intimidated into giving money for a ride. 
As for what to carry when hitching, the advice is to travel light. The rule is to 
make up a pack of the absolute minimum, then cut that in half. Hitching is an art 
form as is all survival. Master it and you'll travel on a free trip forever. 
FREIGHTING 
There is a way to hitch long distances that has certain advantages over letting 
your thumb hang out for hours on some two-laner. Learn about riding the trains 
and you'll always have that alternative. Hitchhiking at night can be impossible, 
but hopping a is easier at night than by day. By hitchhiking days and hopping 
freights and sleeping on them at night, you can cover incredible distances rapidly 
and stay well rested. Every city and most large towns have a freight yard. You 
can find it by following the tracks or asking where the freight yard is located. 
When you get to the yard, ask the workmen when the next train leaving in your 
direction will be pulling out. Unlike the phony Hollywood image, railroad men are 
nice to folks who drop by to grab a ride. Most yards don't have a guard or a "bull" 
as they are called. Even if they do, he is generally not around. If there is a bull 
around, the most he's going to do is tell you it's private property and ask you to 
leave. There are exceptions to this rule, such as the notorious Lincoln, Nebraska, 
and Las Vegas, Nevada, but by asking you can find out. Even if he asks you to 
leave or throws you out, sneak back when your train is pulling out and jump 
aboard. 
After you've located the right train for your trip, hunt for an empty boxcar to ride. 
The men in the yards will generally point one out if you ask. Pig-sties, flat cars 
and coal cars are definitely third class due to exposure to the elements. Boxcars 
are by far the best. They are clean and the roof over your head helps in bad 
weather and cuts down the wind. Boxcars with a hydro-cushion suspension 
system used for carrying fragile cargo make for the smoothest ride. Unless you 
get one, you should be prepared for a pretty bumpy and noisy voyage. 
You should avoid cars with only one door open, because the pin may break, 
locking you in. A car with both doors open gives you one free chance. Pig-backs 
(trailers on flatcars) are generally considered unsafe. Most trains make a number 
of short hops, so if time is an important factor try to get on a "hot shot" express. A 
hot shot travels faster and has priority over other trains in crowded yards. You 
should favor a hot shot even if you have to wait an extra hour or two or more to 
get one going your way. 
If you're traveling at night, be sure to dress warmly. You can freeze your ass off. 
Trains might not offer the most comfortable ride, but they go through beautiful 
countryside that you'd never see from the highway or airway. There are no 
billboards, road signs, cops, Jack-in-the-Boxes, gas stations or other artifacts of 
honky culture. You'll get dirty on the trains so wear old clothes. Don't pass up this 
great way to travel cause some bullshit western scared you out of it. 
CARS 
If you know how to drive and want to travel long distances, the auto 
transportation agencies are a good deal. Look in the Yellow Pages under 
Automobile Transportation and Trucking or Driveway. Rules vary, but normally 
you must be over 21 and have a valid license. Call up and tell them when and 
where you want to go and they will let you know if they have a car available. 
They give you the car and a tank of gas free. You pay the rest. Go to pick up the 
car alone, then get some people to ride along and help with the driving and 
expenses. You can make New York to San Francisco for about eighty dollars in 
tolls and gas in four days without pushing. Usually you have the car for longer 
and can make a whole thing out of it. You must look straight when you go to the 
agency. This can be simply be done by wetting down your hair and shoving it 
under a cap. 
Another good way to travel cheaply is to find somebody who has a car and is 
going your way. Usually underground newspapers list people who either want 
rides or riders. Another excellent place to find information is your local campus. 
Every campus has a bulletin board for rides. Head shops and other community- 
minded stores have notices up on the wall. 
Gas 
If you have a car and need some gas late at night you can get a quart and then 
some by emptying the hoses from the pumps into your tank. There is always a 
fair amount of surplus gas left when the pumps are shut off. 
If your traveling in a car and don't have enough money for gas and tolls, stop at 
the bus station and see if anybody wants a lift. If you find someone, explain your 
money situation and make a deal with him. Hitch-hikers also can be asked to 
chip in on the gas. 
You can carry a piece of tubing in the trunk of your car and when the gas 
indicator gets low, pull up to a nice looking Cadillac on some dark street and 
syphon off some of his gas. Just park your car so the gas tank is next to the 
Caddy's, or use a large can. Stick the hose into his tank, suck up enough to get 
things flowing, and stick the other end into your tank. Having a lower level of 
liquid, you tank will draw gas until you and the Caddy are equal. "To each 
according to his need, from each according to his ability," wrote Marx. Bet you 
hadn't realized until now that the law of gravity affects economics. 
Another way is to park in a service station over their filler hole. Lift off one lid (like 
a small manhole cover), run down twenty feet of rubber tubing thru the hole 
you've cut in your floorboard, then turn on the electric pump which you have 
installed to feed into your gas tank. All they ever see is a parked car. This 
technique is especially rewarding when you have a bus. 
BUSES 
If you'd rather leave the driving and the paying to them, try swiping a ride on the 
bus. Here's a method that has worked well. Get a rough idea of where the bus 
has stopped before it arrived at your station. If you are not at the beginning or 
final stop on the route, wait until the bus you want pulls in and then out of the 
station. Make like the bus just pulled off without you while you went to the 
bathroom. If there is a station master, complain like crazy to him. Tell him you're 
going to sue the company if your luggage gets stolen. He'll put you on the next 
bus for free. If there is no station master, lay your sad tale on the next driver that 
comes along. If you know when the last bus left, just tell the driver you've been 
stranded there for eight hours and you left your kid sleeping on the other bus. 
Tell him you called ahead to the company and they said to grab the next bus and 
they would take care of it. 
The next method isn't totally free but close enough. It's called the hopper-bopper. 
Find a bus that makes a few stops before it gets to where you want to go. The 
more stops with people getting in our out the better. Buy a ticket for the short hop 
and stay on the bus until you end up at your destination. You must develop a 
whole style in order to pull this off because the driver has to forget you are 
connected with the ticket you gave him. Dress unobtrusively or make sure the 
driver hasn't seen your face. Pretend to be asleep when the short hop station is 
reached. If you get questioned, just act upset about sleeping through the stop 
you "really" want and ask if it's possible to get a ride back. 
AIRLINES 
Up and away, junior outlaws! If you really want to get where you're going in a 
hurry, don't forget skyjacker's paradise. Don't forget the airlines. They make an 
unbelievable amount of bread on their inflated prices, ruin the land with incredible 
amounts of polluting wastes and noise, and deliberately hold back aviation 
advances that would reduce prices and time of flight. We know two foolproof 
methods to fly free, but unfortunately we feel publishing them would cause the 
airlines to change their policy. The following methods have been talked about 
enough, so the time seems right to make them known to a larger circle of friends. 
A word should be said right off about stolen tickets. Literally millions of dollars 
worth of airline tickets are stolen each year. If you have good underworld 
contacts, you can get a ticket to anywhere you want at one-fourth the regular 
price. If you are charged more, you are getting a slight rooking. In any case, you 
can get a ticket for any flight or date and just trade it in. They are actually as 
good as cash, except that it takes 30 days to get a refund, and by then they 
might have traced the stolen tickets. If you can get a stolen ticket, exchange or 
use it as soon as possible, and always fly under a phony name. A stolen ticket for 
a trip around the world currently goes for one hundred and fifty dollars in New 
York. 
One successful scheme requires access to the mailbox of a person listed in the 
local phone book. Let's use the name Ron Davis as an example. A woman calls 
one of the airlines with a very efficient sounding rap such as: "Hello, this is Mr. 
Davis' secretary at Allied Chemical. He and his wife would like to fly to Chicago 
on Friday. Could you mail two first-class tickets to his home and bill us here at 
Allied?" Every major corporation probably has a Ron Davis, and the airlines 
rarely bother checking anyway. Order your tickets two days before you wish to 
travel, and pick them up at the mailbox or address you had them sent to. If you 
are uptight in the airport about the tickets, just go up to another airline and have 
the tickets exchanged. 
One gutsy way to hitch a free ride is to board the plane without a ticket. This is 
how it works. Locate the flight you want and rummage through a wastebasket 
until you find an envelope for that particular airline. Shuffle by the counter men 
(which is fairly easy if it's busy). When the boarding call is made, stand in line 
and get on the plane. Flash the empty envelope at the stewardess as you board 
the plane. Carry a number of packages as a decoy, so the stewardess won t ask 
you to open the envelope. If she does, which is rare, and sees you have no 
ticket, act surprised. "Oh my gosh, it must have fallen out in the wash room," will 
do fine. Run back down the ramp as if you're going to retrieve the ticket. 
Disappear and try later on a different airline. Nine out of ten revolutionaries say 
it's the only way to fly. This trick works only on airlines that don't use the boarding 
pass system. 
If you want to be covered completely, use the hopper-bopper method described 
in the section on Buses, with this added security precaution. Buy two tickets from 
different cashiers, or better still, one from an agent in town. Both will be on the 
same flight. Only one ticket will be under a phony name and for the short hop, 
white the ticket under your real name will be for your actual destination. At the 
boarding counter, present the short hop ticket. You will be given an envelope with 
a white receipt in it. Actually, the white receipt is the last leaf in your ticket. Once 
you are securely seated and aloft, take out the ticket with your name and final 
destination. Gently peel away everything but the white receipt. Place the still valid 
ticket back in your pocket. Now remove from the envelope and destroy the short 
hop receipt. In its place, put the receipt for the ticket you have in your pocket. 
When you land at the short hop airport, stay on the plane. Usually the 
stewardesses just ask you if you are remaining on the flight. If you have to, you 
can actually show her your authentic receipt. When you get to your destination, 
you merely put the receipt back on the bonafide ticket that you still have in your 
pocket. It isn't necessary that they be glued together. Present the ticket for a 
refund or exchange it for another ticket. This method works well even in foreign 
countries. You can actually fly around the world for $88.00 using the hopper- 
bopper method and switching receipts. 
If you can't hack these shucks you should at least get a Youth Card and travel for 
half fare. If you are over twenty-two but still in your twenties, you can easily pass. 
Get a card from a friend who has similar color hair and eyes. Your friend can 
easily get one from another airline. You can master your friend's signature and 
get a supporting piece of identification from him to back up your youth card if you 
find it necessary. If you have a friend who works for an airline or travel agency, 
just get a card under your own name and an age below the limit. Your friend can 
validate the card. Flying youth fare is on stand-by, so it's always a good idea to 
call ahead and book a number of reservations under fictitious names on the flight 
you'll be taking. This will fuck up the booking of regular passengers and insure 
you a seat. 
By the way, if you fly cross-country a number of times, swipe one of the plug-in 
head sets. Always remember to pack it in your traveling bag. This way you'll save 
a two dollar fee charged for the in-flight movie. The headsets are interchangeable 
on all airlines. 
One way to fly free is to actually hitch a ride. Look for the private plane area 
located at every airport, usually in some remote part of the field. You can find it 
by noticing where the small planes without airline markings take off and land. Go 
over to the runways and ask around. Often the mechanics will let you know when 
someone is leaving for your destination and point out a pilot. Tell him you lost 
your ticket and have to get back to school. Single pilots often like to have a 
passenger along and it's a real gas flying in a small plane. 
Some foreign countries have special arrangements for free air travel to visiting 
writers, artists or reporters. Brazil and Argentina are two we know of for sure. Call 
or write the embassy of the country you wish to visit in Washington or their 
mission to the United Nations in New York. Writing works best, especially if you 
can cop some stationery from a newspaper or publishing house. Tell them you 
will be writing a feature story for some magazine on the tourist spots or 
handcrafts of the country. The embassy will arrange for you to travel gratis 
aboard one of their air force planes. The planes leave only from Washington and 
New York at unscheduled times. Once you have the O.K. letter from the 
embassy you're all set. This is definitely worth checking out if you want to 
vacation in a foreign country with all sorts of free bonuses thrown in. 
A one-way ride is easy if you want to get into skyjacking. Keep the piece or knife 
in your shoe to avoid possible detection with the "metal scanner," a long black 
tube that acts like a geiger counter. Or use a plastic knife or bomb. It's also 
advisable to wrap your dope in a non-metallic material. Avoid tinfoil. 
The crews have instructions to take you wherever you want to go even if they 
have to refuel, but watch out for air marshals. To avoid air marshals and 
searches pick an airline which flies short domestic hops. You should plan to end 
up in a country hostile to the United States or you'll end up right back where you 
came from in some sturdy handcuffs. One dude wanted to travel in style so he 
demanded $100,000 as a going-away gift. The airlines quickly paid off. The guy 
then got greedy and demanded a hundred million dollars. When he returned to 
pick up the extra pocket money, he got nabbed. None the less, skyjacking 
appears to be the cheapest, fastest way to get away from it all. 
IN CITY TRAVEL 
Any of the public means of transportation can be ripped off easily. Get on the bus 
with a large bill and present it after the bus has left the stop. If the bus is 
crowded, slip in the back door when it opens to dispatch passengers. 
Two people can easily get through the turnstile in a subway on one token by 
doubling up. In some subway systems cards are given out to high school kids or 
senior citizens or employees of the city. The next time you are in a subway 
station notice people flashing cards to the man in the booth and entering through 
the "exit" door. Notice the color of the card used by people in your age group. 
Get a piece of colored paper in a stationery store or find some card of the same 
color you need. Put this "card" in a plastic window of your wallet and flash it in 
the same way those with a bona fide pass do. 
Before entering a turnstile, always test the swing bar. If someone during the day 
put in an extra token, it's still in the machine waiting for you to enter free. 
For every token and coin deposited in an automatic turnstile, there is a foreign 
coin the same size for much less that will work in the machine. (See the Yippie 
Currency Exchange, following, for more info.) Buy a cheap bag of assorted 
foreign coins from a dealer that you can locate in the Yellow Pages. Size up the 
coins with a token from your subway system. You can get any of these coins in 
bulk from a large dealer. Generally they are about 1,000 for five dollars. Tell him 
you make jewelry out of them if he gets suspicious. Giving what almost amounts 
to free subway rides away is a communal act of love. The best outlaws in the 
world rip-off shit for a lot more people than just themselves. Robin Hood lives! 
FREE LAND 
Despite what you may have heard, there is still some rural land left in Amerika. 
The only really free land is available in Alaska and remote barren areas of the 
western states. The latest information in this area is found in a periodic 
publication called Our Public Lands, available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Washington, D.C. 20402. It costs $1 .00 for a subscription. Also 
contact the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, 
Washington, D.C. 20240 and ask for information on "homesteading." By the time 
this book is out though, the Secretary of the Interior's friends in the oil companies 
might have stolen all the available free land. Being an oil company is about the 
easiest way to steal millions. Never call it stealing though, always refer to it as 
"research and development." 
Continental United States has no good free land that we know of, but there are 
some very low prices in areas suited for country communities. Write to School of 
Living, Freeland, Maryland, for their newspaper Green Revolution with the latest 
information in this area. Canada has free land available, and the Canadian 
government will send you a free list if you write to the Department of Land and 
Forests, Parliament Building, Quebec City, Canada. Also write to the 
Geographical Branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, Parliament 
Building, Quebec City, Canada. Correspondence can be carried out with the 
Communications Group, 2630 Point Grey Road, Vancouver 8, British Columbia, 
Canada, for advice on establishing a community in Canada. The islands off the 
coast of British Columbia, its western region and the area along the Kootenai 
River are among the best locations. 
If you just want to rip off some land, there are two ways to do it; openly or 
secretly. If you are going to do it out front, look around for a piece of land that's in 
dispute, which has its sovereignty in question-islands and deltas between the 
U.S. and Canada, or between the U.S. and Mexico, or any number of other 
borderline lands. You might even consider one of the abandoned oil-drilling 
platforms, which are fair game under high seas salvage laws. The possibilities 
are endless. 
If you intend to do it quietly, you will want a completely different type of location. 
Find a rugged area with lots of elbow room and plenty of places to hide, like the 
Rocky Mountains, Florida swamps, Death Valley, or New York City. Put together 
a tight band of guerrillas and do your thing. With luck you will last forever. 
If you just want to camp out or try some hermit living in the plushest surroundings 
available, you'll do best to head for one of the national parks. Since the parks are 
federal property, there's very little the local fuzz can do about you, and the forest 
rangers are generally the live-and-let-live types, although there have been 
increasing reports of long-hairs being vamped on by Smokey the Pig, as in 
Yosemite. You can get a complete list from National Park Service, Department of 
the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. The following is a list of some good ones:

*This summer Yosemite forest rangers tried to evict a group of Yippies from their 
encampment. The Yippies rioted in the valley, spooked the tourists, burned cars 
and fought for their right to stay. 
Earth People's Park is an endeavor to purchase land and allow people to come 
and live for free. They function as a clearing house for people that want to donate 
land and those who wish to settle. They own 600 acres in northern Vermont and 
are trying to raise money to buy more. Write to Earth People's Park, P.O. Box 
313, 1230 Grant Ave., San Francisco, California 94133. 
People's Parks are sprouting up all over as people reclaim the land being ripped 
off by universities, factories, and corrupt city planning agencies. The model is the 
People's Park struggle in Berkeley during the spring of 1969. The people fought 
to defend a barren parking lot they had turned into a community center with 
grass, swings, free-form sculpture and gardens. The University of California, with 
the aid of Ronald Reagan and the Berkeley storm troopers, fought with guns, 
clubs and tear gas to regain the land from the outlaw people. The pigs killed 
James Rector and won an empty victory. For now the park is fenced off, tarred 
over and converted into unused basketball courts and unused parking lots. Not 
one person has violated the oath never to set foot on the site. It stands, cold and 
empty, two blocks north of crowded Telegraph Avenue. If the revolution does not 
survive, all the land will perish under the steam roller of imperialism. People's 
Death Valley will happen in our lifetime. 
FREE HOUSING 
If you are in a city without a place to stay, ask the first group of hip-looking folks 
where you can crash. You might try the office of the local underground 
newspaper. In any hip community, the underground newspaper is generally the 
source of the best up-to-the-moment information. But remember that they are 
very busy, and don't impose on them. Many churches now have runaway 
houses. If you are under sixteen and can hack some bullshit jive about 
"adjusting," "opening a dialogue," and "things aren't that bad," then these are the 
best deals for free room and board. Check out the ground rules first, i.e., length 
of stay allowed, if they inform your parents or police, facilities and services 
available. Almost always they can be accepted at their word, which is something 
very sacred to missionaries. If they became known as double-crossers, the 
programs would be finished. 
Some hip communities have crash pads set up, but these rarely last more than a 
few months. To give out the addresses we have would be quite impractical. We 
have never run across a crash pad that lasted more than a month or so. If in a 
cit, try hustling a room at a college dorm. This is especially good in summer or on 
week-ends. If you have a sleeping bag, the parks are always good, as is "tar 
jungle" or sleeping on the roofs of tall buildings. Local folks will give you some 
good advice on what to watch out for and information on vagrancy laws which 
might help you avoid getting busted. 
For more permanent needs, squatting is not only free, it's a revolutionary act. If 
you stay quiet you can stay indefinitely. If you have community support you may 
last forever. 
COMMUNES 
In the city or in the country, communes can be a cheap and enjoyable way of 
living. Although urban and rural communes face different physical environments, 
they share common group problems. The most important element in communal 
living is the people, for the commune will only make it if everyone is fairly 
compatible. A nucleus of 4 to 7 people is best and it is necessary that no member 
feels extremely hostile to any other member when the commune gets started. 
The idea that things will work out later is pig swill. More communes have busted 
up over incompatibility than any other single factor. People of similar interests 
and political philosophies should live together. One speed freak can wreck 
almost any group. There are just too many day-to-day hassles involved living in a 
commune to not start off compatible in as many ways as possible. The ideal 
arrangement is for the people to have known each other before they move in 
together. 
Once you have made the opening moves, evening meetings will occasionally be 
necessary to divide up the responsibilities and work out the unique problems of a 
communal family. Basically, there are two areas that have to be pretty well 
agreed upon if the commune is to survive. People's attitudes toward Politics, Sex, 
Drugs and Decision-making have to be in fairly close agreement. Then the even 
most important decisions about raising the rent, cleaning, cooking and 
maintenance will have to be made. Ground rules for inviting non-members should 
be worked out before the first time it happens, as this is a common cause for 
friction. Another increasingly important issue involves defense. Communes have 
continually been targets of attack by the more Neanderthal elements of the 
surrounding community. In Minneapolis for example, "headhunts" as they are 
called are commonplace. You should have full knowledge of the local gun laws 
and a collective defense should be worked out. 
Physical attacks are just one way of making war on communes and, hence, our 
Free Nation. Laws, cops, and courts are there to protect the power and the 
property of those that already got the shit. Police harassment, strict enforcement 
of health codes and fire regulations and the specially designed anti-commune 
laws being passed by town elders, should all be known and understood by the 
members of a commune before they even buy or rent property. On all these 
matters, you should seek out experienced members of communes already 
established in the vicinity you wish to settle. Work out mutual defense 
arrangements with nearby families-both legal and extralegal. Remember, not 
only do you have the right to self-defense, but it is your duty to our new Nation to 
erase the "Easy-Rider-take-any-shit" image which invites attack. Let them know 
you are willing to defend your way of living and your chances of survival will 
increase. 
URBAN LIVING 
If you're headed for city living, the first thing you'll have to do is locate an 
apartment or loft, an increasingly difficult task. At certain times of the year, 
notably June and September, the competition is fierce because of students 
leaving or entering school. If you can avoid these two months, you'll have a better 
selection. A knowledge of your plans in advance can aid a great deal in finding 
an apartment, for the area can be scouted before you move in. Often, if you know 
of people leaving a desirable apartment, you can make arrangements with the 
landlord, and a deposit will hold the place. If you let them know you're willing to 
buy their furniture, people will be more willing to give you information about when 
they plan to move. Watch out for getting screwed on exorbitant furniture swindles 
by the previous tenants and excessive demands on the part of the landlords. In 
most cities, the landlord is not legally allowed to ask for more than one month's 
rent as security. Often the monthly rent itself is regulated by a city agency. A little 
checking on the local laws and a visit to the housing agency might prove well 
worth it. 
Don't go to a rental agency unless you are willing to pay an extra month's rent as 
a fee. Wanted ads in newspapers and bulletin boards located in community 
centers and supermarkets have some leads. Large universities have a service for 
finding good apartments for administrators, faculty and students, in that order. 
Call the university, say you have just been appointed to such-and-such position 
and you need housing in the area. They will want to know all your requirements 
and rent limitations, but often they have very good deals available, especially if 
you've appointed yourself to a high enough position. 
Aside from these, the best way is to scout a desired area and inquire about future 
apartments. Often landlords or rental agencies have control over a number of 
buildings in a given area. You can generally find a nameplate inside the hall of 
the building. Calling them directly will let you know of any apartments available. 
When you get an apartment, furnishing will be the next step. You can double 
your sleeping space by building bunk beds. Nail two by fours securely from 
ceiling to floor, about three feet from the walls, where the beds are desired. Then 
build a frame out of two by fours at a convenient height. Make sure you use nails 
or screws strong enough to support the weight of people sleeping or balling. Nail 
a sheet of 3/4 inch plywood on the frame. Mattresses and almost all furniture 
needed for your pal can be gotten free (see section on Free Furniture). 
Silverware can be copped at any self-service restaurant. 
RURAL LIVING 
If you are considering moving to the country, especially as a group, you are 
talking about farms and farmland. There are some farms for rent, and 
occasionally a family that has to be away for a year or two will let you live on their 
farm if you keep the place in repair. These can be found advertised in the back of 
various farming magazines and in the classified sections of newspapers, 
especially the Sunday editions. Generally speaking, however, if you're interested 
in a farm, you should be considering an outright purchase. 
First, you have to determine in what part of the country you want to live in terms 
of the climate you prefer and how far away from the major cities you wish to 
locate. The least populated states, such as Utah, Idaho, the Dakotas, Montana 
and the like, have the cheapest prices and the lowest tax rates. The more 
populated a state, and in turn, the closer to a city, the higher the commercial 
value of the land. 
There are hundreds of different types of farms, so the next set of questions you'll 
have to raise concerns the type of farm activity you'll want to engage in. Cattle 
farms are different than vegetable farms or orchards. Farms come in sizes: from 
half an acre to ranches larger than the state of Connecticut. They will run in price 
from $30 to $3000 an acre, with the most expensive being prime farmland in 
fertile river valleys located close to an urban area. The further away from the city 
and the further up a hill, the cheaper the land gets. It also gets woodier, rockier 
and steeper, which means less tillable land. 
If you are talking of living in a farm house and maybe having a small garden and 
some livestock for your own use, with perhaps a pond on the property, you are 
looking for what is called a recreational farm. When you buy a recreational farm, 
naturally you are interested in the house, barn, well, fences, chicken-coop, 
corrals, woodsheds and other physical structures on the property. Unless these 
are in unusually good condition or unique, they do not enter into the sale price as 
major factors. It is the land itself that is bought and sold. 
Farmland is measured in acreage; an acre being slightly more than 43,560 
square feet. The total area is measured in 40-acre plots. Thus, if a farmer or a 
real estate agent says he has a plot of land down the road, he means a 40-acre 
farm. Farms are generally measured this way, with an average recreational farm 
being 160 acres in size or an area covering about 1/2 square mile. A reasonable 
rate for recreational farmland 100 miles from a major city with good water and a 
livable house would be about $50 per acre. For a 160-acre farm, it would be 
$8,000, which is not an awful lot considering what you are getting. For an overall 
view, get the free catalogues and brochures provided by the United Farm 
Agency, 61 2 W. 47th St., Kansas City, Mo. 641 1 2. 
Now that you have a rough idea of where and what type of farm you want, you 
can begin to get more specific. Check out the classified section in the Sunday 
newspaper of the largest city near your desired location. Get the phone book and 
call or write to real estate agencies in the vicinity. Unlike the city, where there is a 
sellers' market, rural estate agents collect their fee from the seller of the property, 
so you won't have to worry about the agent's fee. 
When you have narrowed down the choices, the next thing you'll want to look at 
is the plot book for the county. The plot book has all the farms in each township 
mapped out. It also shows terrain variations, type of housing on the land, location 
of rivers, roads and a host of other pertinent information. Road accessibility, 
especially in the winter, is an important factor. If the farms bordering the one you 
have selected are abandoned or not in full use, then for all intents and purposes, 
you have more land than you are buying. 
After doing all this, you are prepared to go look at the farm itself. Notice the 
condition of the auxiliary roads leading to the house. You'll want an idea of what 
sections of the land are tillable. Make note of how many boulders you'll have to 
clear to do some planting. Also note how many trees there are and to what extent 
the brush has to be cut down. Be sure and have a good idea of the insect 
problems you can expect. Mosquitoes or flies can bug the shit out of you. Feel 
the soil where you plan to have a garden and see how rich it is. If there are fruit 
trees, check their condition. Taste the water. Find out if hunters or tourists come 
through the land. Examine the house. The most important things are the 
basement and the roof. In the basement examine the beams for dry rot and 
termites. See how long it will be before the roof must be replaced. Next check the 
heating system, the electrical wiring and the plumbing. Then you'll want to know 
about services such as schools, snow plowing, telephones, fire department and 
finally about your neighbors. If the house is beyond repair, you might still want 
the farm, especially if you are good at carpentry. Cabins, A-Frames, domes and 
tepees are all cheaply constructed with little experience. Get the materials from 
your nearest military installation. 
Finally, check out the secondary structures on the land to see how usable they 
are. If there is a pond, you'll want to see how deep it is for swimming. If there are 
streams, you'll want to know about the fishing possibilities; and if large wooded 
areas, the hunting. 
In negotiating the final sales agreement, you should employ a lawyer. You'll also 
want to check out the possibility of negotiating a bank loan for the farm. Don't 
forget that you have to pay taxes on the land, so inquire from the previous owner 
or agent as to the tax bill. Usually, you can count on paying about $50 annually 
per 40-acre plot. 
Finally, check out the federal programs available in the area. If you can learn the 
ins and outs of the government programs, you can rip off plenty. The Feed-Grain 
Program of the Department of Agriculture pays you not to grow grain. The Cotton 
Subsidy Program pays you not to grow cotton. Also look into the Soil Bank 
Program of the United States Development Association and various Department 
of Forestry programs which pay you to plant trees. Between not planting cotton 
and planting trees, you should be able to manage.

FREE EDUCATION 
Usually when you ask somebody in college why they are there, they'll tell you it's 
to get an education. The truth of it is, they are there to get the degree so that they 
can get ahead in the rat race. Too many college radicals are two-timing punks. 
The only reason you should be in college is to destroy it. If there is stuff that you 
want to learn though, there is a way to get a college education absolutely free. 
Simply send away for the schedule of courses at the college of your choice. 
Make up the schedule you want and audit the classes. In smaller classes this 
might be a problem, but even then, if, the teacher is worth anything at all, he'll let 
you stay. In large classes, no one will ever object. 
If you need books for a course, write to the publisher claiming you are a lecturer 
at some school and considering using their book in your course. They will always 
send you free books. 
There are Free Universities springing up all over our new Nation. Anybody can 
teach any course. People sign up for the courses and sometimes pay a token 
registration fee. This money is used to publish a catalogue and pay the rent. If 
you're on welfare you don't have to pay. You can take as many or as few courses 
as you want. Classes are held everywhere: in the instructor's house, in the park, 
on the beach, at one of the student's houses or in liberated buildings. Free 
Universities offer courses ranging from Astrology to the Use of Firearms. The 
teaching is usually of excellent quality and you'll learn in a community-type 
atmosphere.

7. FREE MEDICAL CARE 
Due to the efforts of the Medical Committee for Human Rights, the Student 
Health Organization and other progressive elements among younger doctors and 
nurses. Free People's Clinics have been happening in every major city. They 
usually operate out of store fronts and are staffed with volunteer help. An 
average clinic can handle fifty patients a day. 
If you've had an accident or have an acute illness, even a bad cold, check into 
the emergency room of any hospital. Given them a sob story complete with 
phony name and address. After treatment they present you with a slip and direct 
you to the cashier. Just walk on by, as the song suggests. A good decoy is to ask 
for the washroom. After waiting there a few moments, split. If you're caught 
sneaking out, tell them you ran out of the house without your wallet. Ask them to 
bill you at your phony address. This billing procedure works in both hospital 
emergency rooms and clinics. You can keep going back for repeated visits up to 
three months before the cashier's office tells the doctor about your fractured 
payments. 
You can get speedy medical advice and avoid emergency room delays by calling 
the hospital, asking for the emergency unit and speaking directly to the doctor 
over the phone. Older doctors frown on this procedure since they cannot extort 
their usual exorbitant fee over the phone. Younger ones generally do not share 
this hang-up. 
Cities usually have free clinics for a variety of special ailments. Tuberculosis 
Clinics, Venereal Disease Clinics, and Free Shot Clinics (yellow fever, polio, 
tetanus, etc.) are some of the more common. A directory of these clinics and 
other free health services the local community provides can be obtained by 
writing your Chamber of Commerce or local Health Department. 
Most universities have clinics connected with their dental, optometry or other 
specialized medical schools. If not for free, then certainly for very low rates, you 
can get dental work repaired, eyeglasses fitted and treatment of other specific 
health needs. 
Free psychiatric treatment can often be gotten at the out-patient department of 
any mental hospital. Admission into these hospitals is free, but a real bummer. 
Use them as a last resort only. Some cities have a suicide prevention center and 
if you are desperate and need help, call them. Your best choice in a psychiatric 
emergency is to go to a large general hospital, find the emergency unit and ask 
to see the psychiatrist on duty. 
BIRTH CONTROL CLINICS 
Planned Parenthood and the Family Planning Association staff numerous free 
birth control clinics throughout the country. They provide such services as sex 
education, examinations, Pap smear and birth control information and devices. 
The devices include pills, a diaphragm, or IUD (intra-uterine device) which they 
will insert. If you are unmarried and under 18, you might have to talk to a social 
worker, but it's no sweat because anybody gets contraceptive devices that wants 
them. Call up and ask them to send you their booklets on the different methods 
of birth control available. 
If you would rather go to a private doctor, try to find out from a friend the name of 
a hip gynecologist, who is sympathetic to the fact that you're low on bread. 
Otherwise one visit could cost $25.00 or more. 
Before deciding on a contraceptive, you should be hip to some general 
information. There has been much research on the pill, and during the past 10 
years it has proven its effectiveness, if not is safety. The two most famous name 
brands are Ortho-Novum and Envoid. They all require a doctor's prescription. 
Different type pills are accompanied by slightly different instructions, so read the 
directions carefully. In many women, the pills produce side effects such as weight 
increase, dizziness or nausea. Sometimes the pill affects your vision and more 
often your mood. Some women with specialized blood diseases are advised not 
to use them, but in general, women have little or no trouble. Different brand 
names have different hormonal balances (progesterone-estrogen). If you get 
uncomfortable side effects, insist that your doctor switch your brand. If you stop 
the pill method for any reason and don't want to get pregnant, be very careful to 
use another means right away. 
Another contraceptive device becoming more popular is the IUD, or the loop. It is 
a small plastic or stainless steel irregularly-shaped spring that the doctor inserts 
inside the opening of the uterus. The insertion is not without pain, but it's safe if 
done by a physician, and it's second only to the pill in prevention of pregnancy. 
Once it's in place, you can forget about it for a few years or until you wish to get 
pregnant. Doctors are reluctant to prescribe them for women who have not borne 
children or had an abortion, because of the intense pain that accompanies 
insertion. But if you can stand the pain associated with three to four uterine 
contractions, you should push the doctor for this method. Inserting it during the 
last day of your period will make it easier. 
The diaphragm is a round piece of flexible rubber about 2 inches in diameter with 
a hard rubber rim on the outside. It used to be inserted just before the sex act, 
but hip doctors now recommend that it be worn continuously and taken out every 
few days for washing and also during the menstrual period. It is most effective 
when used with a sperm-killing jelly or cream. A doctor will fit you for a proper 
size diaphragm. 
The next best method is the foams that you insert twenty minutes before fucking. 
The best foams available are Delfen and Emko. They have the advantage of 
being nonprescription items so you can rush into any drug store and pick up a 
dispenser when the spirit moves you. Follow the directions carefully. 
Unfortunately, these foams taste terrible and are not available in flavors. It just 
shows you how far science has to go. 
Another device is the prophylactic, or rubber as it is called. This is the only device 
available to men. It is a thin rubber sheath that fits over the penis. Because they 
are subject to breaking and sliding off, their effectiveness is not super great. If 
you are forced to use them, the best available are lubricated sheepskins with a 
reservoir tip. 
The rhythm method or Vatican roulette as it is called by hip Catholics, is a waste 
unless you are ready to surround yourself with thermometers, graphs and charts. 
You also have to limit your fucking to prescribed days. Even with all these 
precautions, women have often gotten pregnant using the rhythm method. 
The oldest and least effective method is simply for the male to pull out just before 
he comes. There are billions of sperm cells in each ejaculation and only one is 
needed to fertilize the woman's egg and cause a pregnancy. Most of the sperm is 
in the first squirt, so you had better be quick if you employ this technique. 
If the woman misses her period she shouldn't panic. It might be delayed because 
of emotional reasons. Just wait two weeks before going to a doctor or clinic for a 
pregnancy test. When you go, be sure to bring your first morning urine specimen. 
ABORTIONS 
The best way to find out about abortions is to contact your local woman's 
liberation organization through your underground newspaper or radio station. 
Some Family Planning Clinics and even some liberal churches set up abortions, 
but these might run as high as $700. Underground newspapers often have ads 
that read "Any girl in trouble call - -," or something similar. The usual rate for an 
abortion is about $500 and it's awful hard to bargain when you need one badly. 
Only go to a physician who is practicing or might have just lost his license. Forget 
the stereotype image of these doctors as they are performing a vital service. 
Friends who have had an abortion can usually recommend a good doctor and fill 
you in on what's going to happen. 
Abortions are very minor operations if done correctly. They can be done almost 
any time, but after three months, it's no longer so casual and more surgical skill is 
required. Start making plans as soon as you find out. The sooner the better, in 
terms of the operation. 
Get a pregnancy test at a clinic. If it is positive and you want an abortion, start 
that day to make plans. If you get negative results from the test and still miss 
your period, have a gynecologist perform an examination if you are still worried. 
If you cannot arrange an abortion through woman's liberation, Family Planning, a 
sympathetic clergyman or a friend who has had one, search out a liberal hospital 
and talk to one of their social workers. Almost all hospitals perform "therapeutic" 
abortions. Tell a sob story about the desertion of your boy friend or that you take 
LSD every day or that defects run in your family. Act mentally disturbed. If you 
qualify, you can get an abortion that will be free under Medicaid or other welfare 
medical plans. The safest form of abortion is the vacuum-curettage method, but 
not all doctors are hip to it. It is safer and quicker with less chance of 
complications than the old-fashioned scrape method. 
Many states have recently passed liberalized abortion laws, such as New York* 
(by far the most extensive), Hawaii and Maryland, due to the continuing pressure 
of radical women. The battle for abortion and certainly for free abortion is far from 
over even in the states with liberal laws. They are far too expensive for the ten to 
twenty minute minor operation involved and the red tape is horrendous. Free 
abortions must be look-on as a fundamental right, not a sneaky, messy trauma. 
*There is a residence requirement for New York but using a friend's New York 
address at the hospital will be good enough. The procedure takes only a few 
days and costs between $200 and $500, depending on the place. The best 
advice is to call one of the New York Abortion Referral Services or Birth Control 
Groups listed in the New York Directory section. 
DISEASES TREATED FREE 
Syph and Clap (syphilis and gonorrhea) are two diseases that they are easy to 
pick up. They come from balling. Anyone who claims they got it from sitting on a 
toilet seat must have a fondness for weird positions. 
Both men and women are subject to the diseases. Using a prophylactic usually 
will prevent the spreading of venereal disease, but you should really seek to have 
it cured. Syphilis usually begins with an infection which may look like a cold sore 
or pimple around the sex organ. There is no pain associated with the lesions. 
Soon the sore disappears even without treatment. This is often followed by a 
period of rashes on the body (especially the palms of the hands) and 
inflammation of the mouth and throat. These symptoms also disappear without 
treatment. It must be understood, however, that even if these symptoms 
disappear, the disease still remains if left untreated. It can cause serious trouble 
such as heart disease, blindness, insanity and paralysis. Also, it can fuck up any 
kids you might produce and is easily passed on to anyone you ball. 
Gonorrhea (clap) is more common than syphilis. Its first signs are a discharge 
from your sex organ that is painful. Like syphilis, it affects both men and women, 
but is often unnoticed in women. There is usually itching and burning associated 
with the affected area. It can leave you sterile if left untreated. 
Both these venereal diseases can be treated in a short time with attention. Avail 
yourself of the free V.D. clinics in every town. Follow the doctor's instructions to 
the letter and try to let the other people you've had sexual contact with know you 
hadVD. 
There are other fungus diseases that resemble syphilis or gonorrhea, but are 
relatively harmless. Check out every infection in your crotch area, especially 
those with open sores or an unusual discharge and you'll be safe. 
Crabs are not harmful, but they can make you scratch your crotch for hours on 
end. They are also highly transmittable by balling. Actually they are a form of 
body lice and easy to cure. Go to your local druggist and ask him for the best 
remedy available. He'll give you one of several lotions and instructions for proper 
use. We recommend Kwell. 
A common disease in the hip community is hepatitis. There are two kinds. One 
you get from sticking dirty needles in your arm (serum hepatitis) and the other 
more common strain from eating infected food or having intimate contact with an 
infected carrier (infectious hepatitis). The symptoms for both are identical; 
yellowish skin and eyes, dark piss and light crap, loss of appetite and total 
listlessness. Hep is a very dangerous disease that can cause a number of 
permanent conditions, including death, which is extremely permanent. It should 
be treated by a doctor, often in a hospital. 
STRIKE! STRIKE! STRIKE! 
FREE COMMUNICATION 
If you don't like the news, why not go out and make your own? Creating free 
media depends to a large extent on your imagination and ability to follow through 
on ideas. The average Amerikan is exposed to over 1,600 commercials each 
day. Billboards, glossy ads and television spots make up much of the word 
environment they live in. To crack through the word mush means creating new 
forms of free communication. Advertisements for revolution are important in 
helping to educate and mold the milieu of people you wish to win over. 
Guerrilla theater events are always good news items and if done right, people will 
remember them forever. Throwing out money at the Stock Exchange or dumping 
soot on executives at Con Edison or blowing up the policeman statue in Chicago 
immediately conveys an easily understood message by using the technique of 
creative disruption. Recently to dramatize the illegal invasion of Cambodia, 400 
Yippies stormed across the Canadian border in an invasion of the United States. 
They threw paint on store windows and physically attacked residents of Blair, 
Washington. A group of Vietnam veterans marched in battle gear from Trenton to 
Valley Forge. Along the way they performed mock attacks on civilians the way 
they were trained to do in Southeast Asia. 
Dying all the outdoor fountains red and then sending a message to the 
newspaper explaining why you did it, dramatizes the idea that blood is being 
shed needlessly in imperialist wars. A special metallic bonding glue available 
from Eastman-Kodak will form a permanent bond in only 45 seconds. Gluing up 
locks of all the office buildings in your town is a great way to dramatize the fact 
that our brothers and sisters are being jailed all the time. Then, of course, there 
are always explosives which dramatically make your point and then some. 
PRESS CONFERENCES 
Another way of using the news to advertise the revolution and make propaganda 
is to call a press, conference. Get an appropriate place that has some 
relationship to the content of your message. Send out announcements to as 
many members of the press as you can. If you do not have a press list, you can 
make one up by looking through the Yellow Pages under Newspapers, Radio 
Stations, Television Stations, Magazines and Wire Services. Check out your list 
with other groups and pick up names of reporters who attend movement press 
conferences. Address a special invitation to them as well as one to their 
newspaper. Address the announcements to "City Desk" or '"News Department." 
Schedule the press conference for about 1 1 :00 A.M. as this allows the reporters 
to file the story in time for the evening newscast or papers. On the day of the 
scheduled conference, call the important city desks or reporters about 9:00 A.M. 
and remind them to come. 
Everything about a successful press conference must be dramatic, from the 
announcements and phone calls to the statements themselves. Nothing creates 
a worse image than four or five men in business suits sitting behind a table and 
talking in a calm manner at a fashionable hotel. Constantly seek to have every 
detail of the press conference differ in style as well as content from the 
conferences of people in power. Make use of music and visual effects. Don't 
stiffen up before the press. Make the statement as short and to the point as 
possible. Don't read from notes, look directly into the camera. The usual 
television spot is one minute and twenty seconds. The cameras start buzzing on 
your opening statement and often run out of film before you finish. So make it 
brief and action packed. The question period should be even more dramatic. Use 
the questioner's first name when answering a question. This adds an air of 
informality and networks are more apt to use an answer directed personally to 
one of their newsmen. Express your emotional feelings. Be funny, get angry, be 
sad or ecstatic. If you cannot convey that you are deeply excited or troubled or 
outraged about what you are saying, how do you expect it of others who are 
watching a little image box in their living room? Remember, you are advertising a 
new way of life to people. Watch TV commercials. See how they are able to 
convey everything they need to be effective in such a short time and limited 
space. At the same tune you're mocking the shit they are pushing, steal their 
techniques. 
At rock concerts, during intermission or at the end of the performance, fight your 
way to the stage. 
COMMUNICATION 
Announce that if the electricity is cut off the walls will be torn down. This 
galvanizes the audience and makes the owners of the hall the villains if they fuck 
around. Lay out a short exciting rap on what's coming down. Focus on a call 
around one action. Sometimes it might be good to engage rock groups in 
dialogues about their commitment to the revolution. Interrupting the concert is 
frowned upon since it is only spitting in the faces of the people you are trying to 
reach. Use the Culture as ocean to swim in. Treat it with care. 
Sandwich boards and hand-carried signs are effective advertisements. You can 
stand on a busy corner and hold up a sign saying "Apartment Needed," "Free 
Angela," "Smash the State" or other slogans. They can be written on dollar bills, 
envelopes that are being mailed and other items that are passed from person to 
person. 
Take a flashlight with a large face to movie theaters and other dark public 
gathering places. Cut the word "STRIKE" or "REVOLT" or "YIPPIE" out of dark 
cellophane. Paste the stencil over the flashlight, thus allowing you to project the 
word on a distant wall. 
There are a number of all night call-in shows that have a huge audience. If you 
call with what the moderator considers "exciting controversy," he may give you a 
special number so you won't have to compete in the switchboard roller-derby. It 
often can take hours before you get through to these shows. Here's a trick that 
will help you out if the switchboard is jammed. The call-in shows have a series of 
hones so that when one is busy the next will take the call. Usually the numbers 
run in sequence. Say a station gives out PL 5-8640, as the number to call. That 
means it also uses PL 5-8641, PL 5-8642 and so on. If you get a busy signal, 
hang up and try calling PL S-8647 say. This trick works in a variety of situations 
where you want to get a call through a busy switchboard. Remember it for airline 
and bus information. 
WALL PAINTING 
One of the best forms of free communication is painting messages on a blank 
wall. The message must be short and bold. You want to be able to paint it on 
before the pigs come and yet have it large enough so that people can see it at a 
distance. Cans of spray paint that you can pick up at any hardware store work 
best. Pick spots that have lot of traffic. Exclamation points are good for 
emphasis. If you are writing the same message, make a stencil. You can make a 
stencil that says WAR and spray it on with white paint under the word "STOP" on 
stop signs. You can stencil a five-pointed star and using yellow paint, spray it on 
the dividing line between the red and blue on all post office boxes. This simulates 
the flag of the National Liberation Front of Vietnam. You can stencil a marijuana 
leaf and using green paint, spray it over cigarette and whisky billboards on buses 
and subways. The women's liberation sign with red paint is good for sexist ads. 
Sometimes you will wish to exhibit great daring in your choice of locations. When 
the Vietnamese hero Nguyen Van Troi was executed, the Viet Cong put up a 
poster the next day on the exact spot inside the highest security prison in the 
country. 
Wall postering allows you to get more information before the public than a quickly 
scribbled slogan. Make sure the surface is smooth or finely porous. Smear the 
back of the poster with condensed milk, spread on with a brush, sponge, rag or 
your hands. Condensed milk dries very fast and hard. Also smear some on the 
front once the poster is up to give protection against the weather and busy 
fingers that like to pull at corners. Wallpaper pastes also work quickly and 
efficiently. It's best to work both painting and postering at night with a look-out. 
This way you can work the best spots without being harassed by the pig patrol, 
which is usually unappreciative of Great Art. 
USE OF THE FLAG 
The generally agreed upon flag of our nation is black with a red, five pointed star 
behind a green marijuana leaf in the center. It is used by groups that understand 
the correct use of culture and symbolism in a revolutionary struggle. When 
displayed, it immediately increases the feelings of solidarity between our brothers 
and sisters. High school kids have had great fights over which flag to salute in 
school. A sign of any liberated zone is the flag being flown. Rock concerts and 
festivals have their generally apolitical character instantly changed when the flag 
is displayed. The political theoreticians who do not recognize the flag and the 
importance of the culture it represents are ostriches who are ignorant of basic 
human nature. Throughout history people have fought for religion, life-style, land, 
a flag (nation), because they were ordered to, for fortune, because they were 
attacked or for the hell of it. If you don't think the flag is important, ask the 
hardhats. 
RADIO 
Want to construct your own neighborhood radio station? You can get a carrier- 
current transmitter designed by a group of brothers and sisters called Radio Free 
People. No FCC license is required for the range is less than 1/2 mile. The small 
transistorized units plug into any wall outlet. Write Radio Free People, 133 
Mercer St., New York, New York 10012 for more details. For further information 
see the chapter on Guerrilla Broadcasting later in the book. 
FREE TELEPHONES 
Ripping off the phone company is so common that Bell Telephone has a special 
security division that tries to stay just a little ahead of the average free-loader. 
Many great devices like the coat hanger release switch have been scrapped 
because of changes in the phone box. Even the credit card fake-out is doomed to 
oblivion as the company switches to more computerized techniques. In our 
opinion, as long as there is a phone company, and as long as there are outlaws, 
nobody need ever pay for a call. In 1969 alone the phone company estimated 
that over 10 million dollars worth of free calls were placed from New York City. 
Nothing, however, compares with the rip-off of the people by the phone 
company. In that same year, American Telephone and Telegraph made a profit 
of 8.6 billion dollars! AT&T, like all public utilities, passes itself off as a service 
owned by the people, while in actuality nothing could be further from the truth. 
Only a small percentage of the public owns stock in these companies and a tiny 
elite clique makes all the policy decisions. Ripping-off the phone company is an 
act of revolutionary love, so help spread the word. 
PAY PHONES 
You can make a local 10 cent call for 2 cents by spitting on the pennies and 
dropping them in the nickel slot. As soon as they are about to hit the trigger 
mechanism, bang the coin-return button. Another way is to spin the pennies 
counter-clockwise into the nickel slot. Hold the penny in the slot with your finger 
and snap it spinning with a key or other flat object. Both systems take a certain 
knack, but once you've perfected the technique, you'll always have it in your 
survival kit. 
If two cents is too much, how about a call for 1 penny? Cut a 1/4 strip off the 
telephone book cover. Insert the cardboard strip into the dime slot as far as it will 
go. Drop a penny in the nickel slot until it catches in the mechanism (spinning will 
help). Then slowly pull the strip out until you hear the dial tone. 
A number 14 brass washer with a small piece of scotch tape over one side of the 
hole will not only get a free call, but works in about any vending machine that 
takes dimes. You can get a box of thousands for about a dollar at any hardware 
store. You should always have a box around for phones, laundromats, parking 
meters and drink machines. 
Bend a bobby pin after removing the plastic from the tips and jab it down into the 
transmitter (mouthpiece). When it presses against the metal diaphragm, rub it on 
a metal wall or pipe to ground it. When you've made contact you'll hear the dial 
tone. If the phone uses old-fashioned rubber black tubing to enclose the wires 
running from the headset to the box, you can insert a metal tack through the 
tubing, wiggle it around a little until it makes contact with the bare wires and 
touch the tack to a nearby metal object for grounding. 
Put a dime in the phone, dial the operator and tell her you have ten cents credit. 
She'll return your dime and get your call for free. If she asks why, say you made 
a call on another pay phone, lost the money, and the operator told you to switch 
phones and call the credit operator. 
This same method works for long distance calls. Call the operator and find out 
the rate for your call. Hang up and call another operator telling her you just dialed 
San Francisco direct, got a wrong number and lost $.95 or whatever it is. She will 
get your call free of charge. 
If there are two pay phones next to each other, you can call long distance on one 
and put the coins in the other. When the operator cuts in and asks you to deposit 
money, drop the coins into the one you are not using, but hold the receiver up to 
the slots so the operator can hear the bells ring. When you've finished, you can 
simply press the return button on the phone with the coins in it and out they 
come. If you have a good tape recorder you can record the sounds of a quarter, 
dime and nickel going into a pay phone and play them for the operator in various 
combinations when she asks for the money. Turn the volume up as loud as you 
can get it. 
You can make a long distance call and charge it to a phone number. Simply tell 
the operator you want to bill the call to your home phone because you don't have 
the correct change. Tell her there is no one there now to verify the call, but you 
will be home in an hour and she can call you then if there is any question. Make 
sure the exchange goes with the area you say it does. 
Always have a number of made-up credit card numbers. The code letter for 1970 
is S, then seven digits of the phone number and a three digit district number (not 
the same as area code). The district number should be under 599. Example: S- 
573-2100-421 or S-537-3402-035. Look up the phone numbers for your area by 
simply requesting a credit card for your home phone which is very easy to get 
and then using the last three numbers with another phone number. Usually 
making up exotic numbers from far away places will work quite well as it would 
be impossible for an operator to spot a phony number in the short time she has 
to check her list. 
We advise against making phony credit card calls on a home phone. We have 
seen a gadget that you install between the wall socket and the cord which not 
only allows you to receive all the calls you want for free, but eliminates the most 
common form of electronic bugging. They are being manufactured and sold for 
fifty dollars by a disgruntled telephone engineer in Massachusetts. Unfortunately 
you are going to have to find him on your own or duplicate his efforts, for he has 
sworn us to secrecy. If someone does, however, offer you such a device, it 
probably does work. Test it by installing it and having someone call you from a 
pay phone. If it's working, the person should get their dime back at the end of the 
call. 
Actually if you know the slightest information about wiring, you can have your 
present phone disconnected on the excuse that you'll be leaving town for a few 
months and then connect the wires into the main trunk lines on your own. 
Extensions can easily be attached to your main line without the phone company 
knowing about it. 
You can make all the free long distance calls you want by calling your party 
collect at a pay phone. Just have your friend go to a prearranged phone booth at 
a prearranged time. This can be done on the spot by having the friend call you 
person to person. Say you're not in, but ask for the number calling you since 
you'll be "back" in five minutes. Once you get the number simply hang up, wait a 
moment and call back your friend collect. The call has to be out of the state to 
work, since operators are familiar with the special extension numbers assigned to 
pay phones for her area and possibly for nearby areas as well. If she asks you if 
it is a pay phone say no. If she finds out during the call (which rarely happens) 
and informs you of this, simply say you didn't expect the party to have a pay 
phone in his house and accept the charges. We have never heard of this 
happening though. The trick of calling person-to-person collect should always be 
used when calling long distance on home-to-home phones also. You can hear 
the voice of your friend saying that he'll be back in a few minutes. Simply hang 
up, wait a moment and call station to station, thereby getting a person-to-person 
call without the extra charges which can be considerable on a long call during 
business hours. 
If you plan to stay at your present address for only a few more months, stop 
paying the bill and call like crazy. After a month you get the regular bill which you 
avoid paying. Another month goes by and the next bill comes with last month's 
balance added to it. Shortly thereafter you get a note advising you that your 
service will be terminated in ten days if you don't pay the bill. Wait a few days 
and send them a five or ten dollar money order with a note saying you've had an 
accident and are pressed for funds because of large medical bills, but you'll send 
them the balance as soon as you are up and around again. That will hold them 
for another month. In all, you can stretch it out for four or five months with a 
variety of excuses and small payments. This also works with the gas and electric 
companies and with any department stores you conned into letting you charge. 
You can get the service deposit reduced to half of the normal rate if you are a 
student or have other special qualifications. Surprisingly, these rates and 
discounts vary from area to area, so check around before you go into the 
business office for your phone. There is an incredible 50 cents charge per month 
for not having your phone listed. If you want an unlisted phone, you can avoid 
this fee by having the phone listed in a fictitious name, even if the bill is sent to 
you. Just say you want your roommate's name listed instead of your own. 
FREE PLAY 
MOVIES AND CONCERTS 
There are many ways to sneak into theaters, concerts, stadiums and other 
entertainment houses. All these places have numerous fire exits with push-bar 
doors that open easily from the inside. Arrive early with a group of friends, after 
casing the joint and selecting the most convenient exit. Pay for one person to get 
in. When he does he simply opens the designated exit door when the ushers are 
out of the area and everyone rushes inside. 
For theatrical chains in large cities, call their home office and ask to speak to the 
vice-president in charge of publicity, sales, or personnel. Ask what his name is so 
you'll know who you're talking to. When you get the information you want, hang 
up. Now you have the name of a high official in the company. Compile a short list 
of officials in the various film, theater and sporting event companies. Next all the 
various theaters and do the same thing for the theater managers. Once you have 
the two lists you are ready to proceed. Call the theater you want to attend. When 
someone answers say you're Mr. from the home office calling Mr. 
(manager's name) and you'd like to have two passes O.K'd for two 
important people from out of town. Invariably she'll just ask their names or tell 
them to mention your name at the box office. Not only will you get in free, but you 
can avoid waiting in line with this fake-out. 
In Los Angeles and New York, the studios hold pre-release screenings for all 
movies. If you know roughly when a movie is about to come out, call the publicity 
department of the studio producing the film and say you're the critic for a 
newspaper or magazine (give the name) and ask them when you can screen the 
film. They'll give you the time and place of various screenings. When you go, ask 
them to put you on their list and you'll get notices of all future screenings. 
One of our favorite ways to sneak into a theater with continuously running shows 
is the following. Arrive just as the show is emptying out and join the line leaving 
the theater. Exclaiming, "Oh, my gosh!" you slap your forehead, turn around and 
return, tell the usher you left your hat, pocketbook, etc. inside. Once you're inside 
the theater, just swipe some popcorn and wait for the next show. 
RECORDS AND BOOKS 
If you have access to a few addresses, you can get all kinds of records and 
books from clubs on introductory offers. Since the cards you mail back are not 
signed there is no legal way you can be held for the bill. You get all sorts of 
threatening mail, which, by the way, also comes free. 
If you have a friend who is a member of a record club, ask him to submit your 
name as a free member. He gets 4 free records for getting you signed up. A soon 
as you get the letter saying how lucky you are to be a member, quit. Your friend's 
free records have already been shipped. We used to have at least 10 different 
names and addresses working on all the record and book companies. Every 
other day we would ride around collecting the big packages. To cap it off, we 
opened a credit account at a large department store and used to return most of 
the records and books to the store saying that they were gifts and we wanted 
something else. Since we had an account at the store, they always took the 
merchandise and gave credit for future purchases. 
You can always use the public libraries. Find out when they do their yearly 
housecleaning. Every library discards thousands of books on this day. Just show 
up and ask if you can take some. 
Almost anything you might want to know from plans for constructing a sundial to 
a complete blueprint for building a house may be obtained free from the 
Government Printing Office. Write: to Superintendent of Documents, Government 
Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402. Most publication are free. Those that are 
not are dirt cheap. Ask to be put on the list to receive the free biweekly list of 
Selected U.S. Government Publications. 
One of the best ways to receive records and books free is to invest twenty dollars 
and print up some stationery with an artistic logo for some non-existent 
publication. Write to all the public relations departments of record companies, 
publishing houses, and movie studios. Say you are a newspaper with a large 
youth readership and have regular reviews of books, or records, or movies, and 
would like to be placed on their mailing list. Say that you would be glad to send 
them any reviews of their records that appear in the paper. That adds a note of 
authenticity to the letter. After a month or so you'll be receiving more records and 
books than you can use. 
If you really want a book badly enough, follow the title of this one-Dig! 
FREE MONEY 
No book on survival should fail to give you some good tips on how to rip-off 
bread. Really horning in on this chapter will put you on Free-loader Street life, 
'cause with all the money in Amerika, the only thing you'll have trouble getting is 
poor. 
WELFARE 
It's easy to get on welfare that anyone who is broke and doesn't have a regular 
relief check coming in is nothing but a goddamn lazy bum! Each state has a 
different set up. The racist penny-pinchers of Mississippi dole out only $8.00 a 
month. New York dishes ont the most with monthly payments up to $120.00. The 
Amerikan Public Welfare Association publishes a book called The Public Welfare 
Directory with information on exactly what each welfare agency provides and 
how you go about qualifying. You can read the directory at any public library to 
find out all you can about how your local office operates. 
When you've discovered everything you need to know, head on down to the 
Welfare Department in your grubbiest clothes. Not sleeping the night before 
helps. The receptionist will assign an "intaker" to interview you. After a long wait, 
you'll be directed to a desk. The intaker raps to you for a while, generally showing 
sympathy for your plight and turns you over to the caseworker who will make the 
final and ultimate assessment. 
Have your heaviest story ready to ooze out. If you have no physical disabilities, 
lay down a "mentally deranged" rap. Getting medical papers saying you have any 
long-term illness or defect helps a lot. Tell the caseworker you get dizzy spells on 
the job and faint in the street. Keep bobbing your head, yawning, or scratching. 
Tell him that you have tried to commit suicide recently because you just can't 
make it in a world that has forgotten how to love. Don't lay it on too obviously. 
Wait till he "pries" some of the details from you. This makes the story even more 
convincing. Many welfare workers are young and hip. The image you are working 
on is that of a warm, sensitive kid victimized by brutal parents and a cold ruthless 
society. Tell them you held off coming for months because you wanted to 
maintain some self-respect even though have been walking the streets broke and 
hungry. If you are a woman tell him you were recently raped. In sexist Amerika, 
this will probably be true. 
After about an hour or so of this soap-opera stuff, you'll be ready to get your first 
check. From then on it's a monthly check, complete medical care for free and all 
sorts of other outasight benefits. Occasionally the caseworker will drop by your 
pad or ask you down to the office to see how you're coming along, but with your 
condition, things don't look so good. Don't abandon hope though. Hope always 
helps fill in a caseworker's report. 
The real trick is to parlay welfare payments in a few different states. Work out an 
exchange system with a buddy and mail each other the checks when they come 
in. If the caseworker comes by, your roommate can say you went to find a job or 
enrolled in a class. We know cats who have parlayed welfare payments up to six 
hundred dollars a month. 
UNEMPLOYMENT 
Every outlaw should learn everything there is to know about the rules governing 
unemployment insurance. As in the case of welfare rules, eligibility, and the size 
of payments differ from state to state. In New York, you are eligible for payments 
equivalent to half your weekly salary before taxes up to $65 per week, on the 
condition that you have worked for a minimum of twenty weeks during the year. 
Payments are somewhat lower in most other states. In order to collect, you must 
show you are actively searching for a job and keep a record of employers you 
contact. This can easily be fudged. Every time you're questioned about it, 
mention one or two companies. If your hair is long, you'll have no problem. Just 
say they won't hire you until you get a haircut. When this is the case, the 
unemployment office cannot cut off your payments or your hair. They also cannot 
make you accept a job you do not want. Tell them any job offer you get is not 
challenging enough for your talents. Unemployment can be collected for six 
months before payments are terminated. Twenty more weeks of slavery and you 
can go back to maintaining your dignity in the unemployment line. These job 
insurance payments cannot be taxed and since you are working so few weeks 
out of each year, your taxable income is at a minimum. Read all the fine print for 
tax form 1040 and discover all the deductible loopholes available to you. You 
should wind up paying no taxes at all or having all the taxes that were deducted 
from your pay reimbursed. Never turn over to the pig government any funds you 
can rip off. Remember, it isn't your government, so why submit to its taxation if 
you feel you do not have representation. 
PANHANDLING 
The practice of going up to folks and bumming money is a basic hustling art. If 
you are successful at panhandling, you'll be able to master all the skills in the 
book and then some. To be good at it requires a complete knowledge of what 
motivates people. Even if we don't need the bread, we panhandle on the streets 
in the same way doctors go back to medical school. It helps us stay in shape. 
Panhandling is illegal throughout Pig Empire, but it's one of those laws that is 
rarely enforced unless they want to "clean the area" of hippies. If you're in a 
strange locale, ask a fellow panhandler what the best places to work are without 
risking a bust. Do it in front of supermarkets, theaters, sporting events, hip dress 
shops and restaurants. College cafeterias are very good hunting grounds. 
When you're hustling, be assertive. Don't lean against the wall with your palm out 
mumbling "Spare some change?" Go up to people and stand directly in front of 
them so they have to look you in the eye and say no. Bum from guys with dates. 
Bum from motherly looking types. After a while you'll get a sense of the type of 
people you get results with. 
Theater can be real handy. The best actors get the most bread. Devising a street 
theater skit can help. A good prop is a charity canister. You can get them by 
going to the offices of a mainstream charity and signing up as a collector. Don't 
feel bad about ripping them off. Charities are the biggest swindle around. 80% or 
more of the funds raised by honky charities go to the organization itself. New 
fancy cars for the Red Cross, inflated salaries for the executives of the Cancer 
Fund, tax write-offs for Jerry Lewis. You get the picture. A good way to work this 
and keep your karma in shape is to turn over half to a revolutionary groups such 
as your local underground. Remember, fugitives from injustice depend on you to 
survive. Be a responsible member of our nation. Support the only war we have 
going! 
RIP-OFFS 
If you are closing out your checking account, overdraw your account by $10.00. 
The bank won't bother chasing you down for a lousy 10 bucks. 
Call the telephone operator from time to time and tell her you lost some change 
in a pay phone. They will mail you the cash. 
You can get $150 to $600 in advance by willing your body to a University medical 
school. They have you sign a lot of papers and put a tattoo on your foot. You can 
get the tattoo removed and sell your body to the folks across the street. The 
universities can be ripped off by enrolling, applying for a loan and bugging out 
after the loan comes through. This is a lot easier than you might imagine and you 
can hit them for up to $2,500 with a good enough story. 
Put a number 14 brass washer in a newspaper vending machine and take out all 
the papers. Stand around the corner or go into the local bar and sell them. You 
often get tipped. Don't do this with underground papers. Remember they're your 
brothers and sisters. 
The airlines will give you $250 for each piece of luggage you lose when flying. 
The following is a good way to lose your luggage. When you get off a plane, have 
a friend meet you at the gate. Give him your luggage claim stubs and arrange to 
meet at a washroom or restaurant. Your friend picks up the bags and takes them 
out of the baggage room. Before he leaves the airport, he turns over the stubs to 
you at your prearranged rendezvous. You casually wander over to the baggage 
department and search for your elusive luggage. When all the baggage has been 
claimed, file a complaint with the lost and found department. They'll have you fill 
out a form, explain that it probably got misplaced on another carrier and promise 
to send it to you as soon as it is located. In a month you'll receive a check for 
$250 per bag. Enjoy your flight. 
THE INTERNATIONAL YIPPIE CURRENCY EXCHANGE 
Every time you drop a coin into a slot, you are losing money needlessly. There is 
at least one foreign coin that is the same size or close enough that will do the 
trick for less than a penny. The following are some of the foreign currencies that 
will get you that Coke, call or subway ride. 
Quarter Size Coins 
. URUGUAYAN 10 CENTISIMO PIECE 
o works in many soda and candy machines, older telephones (3 slot 
types), toll machines, laundromats, parking meters, stamp 
machines, and restroom novelty machines. Works also in some 
electric cancerette machines but not most mechanical machines. 
. DANISH 5 ORE PIECE 
o works in 3 slot telephones, toll machines, laundromats, automats, 
some stamp machines, most novelty machines, and the Boston 
Subway. Does not work in soda or cancerette machines. 
. PERUVIAN 20 CENTAVO PIECES 
o works in new (one slot) telephone and some electric cancerette 
machines, but does not work as many places in the Uruguay, 
Danish and Peruvian coins. 
. ICELANDIC 5 AURAN PIECE 
o most effective quarter in the world, even works in change 
machines. Unfortunately, this coin is practically impossible to get 
outside of Iceland and even there, it is becoming difficult since the 
government is attempting to remove it from circulation. 
Dime Size Coins 
. MALAYSIAN PENNY 
o generally works in all dime slots, including old and new telephones, 
candy machines, soda machines, electric machines, stamp 
machines, parking meters, photocopy machines, and pay toilets. 
Does not work in some newer stamp dispensers, and some 
mechanical cancerette machines. 
. TRINIDAD PENNY 
o generally works the same as Malaysian Penny. 
New York Subway Tokens 
. DANISH 25 ORE PIECE 
o works in 95% of all subway turnstiles. A very safe coin to use since 
it will not jam the turnstile. It is 5/l000th of an inch bigger than a 
token. 
. PORTUGUESE 50 CENTAVO PIECE 
o the average Portuguese Centavo Piece is 2/1 000th of an inch 
smaller than a token. 
. JAMAICAN HALF PENNY, BAHAMA PENNY and AUSTRALIAN 
SCHILLING 
o these coins are 12/I000th to 15/1 000th of an inch smaller than 
token. They work in about 80% of all turnstiles. We have also had 
good success with FRENCH I FRANC PIECE (WWII issue), 
SPANISH 10 CENTAVO PIECE NICARAGUAN 25 CENTAVO 
PIECE. 
All of the coins listed have a currency value of a few cents, with most less than 
one penny. Foreign coins work more regularly than slugs and are non-magnetic, 
hence cannot be detected by "slug detector machines." Also unlike slugs, 
although they are illegal to use in machines, they are perfectly legal to possess 
and exchange. 
Large coin dealers and currency exchanges are generally uptight about handling 
cheap foreign coins in quantity since they don't make much profit and are subject 
to certain pressures in selling coins that are the same size as Amerikan coins or 
tokens. 
People planning trips to European or South American countries should bring 
back rolls of coins as souvenirs or for use in "coin jewelry." 
If you do not plan to travel, a small coin store which is cool about selling to the 
public is located on the Lower East Side at 191 East Third Street, New York City. 
When their phone works, the number is 475-9897. 
Washers are the most popular types of slugs. You can go to any hardware store 
and match them up with various coins. Sometimes you might have to put a small 
piece of scotch tape over one side of the hole to make it more effective. Each 
washer is identified by its material and number, i.e. No. 14 brass washer with 
scotch tape on one side is a perfect dime. When you get the ones you want, you 
can buy thousands for next to nothing (especially at industrial supply stores) and 
pass them out to our friends. 
Xerox copies of both sides of a dollar bill, carefully glued together, work in most 
machines that give you change for a dollar. Excuse us, there is a knock at the 
door. . .Fancy that! It's the Treasury Department. Wonder what they want? 
FREE DOPE 
BUYING, SELLING AND GIVING IT AWAY 
As you probably know, most dope is illegal, therefore some risks are always 
involved in buying and selling. "Eternal vigilance and constant mobility are the 
passwords of survival," said Che Guevara, and nowhere do they apply more than 
in the world of dope. If you ever have the slightest doubt about the person with 
whom you're dealing-DON'T. 
Buying 
In the purchasing of dope, arrests are not a problem unless you're the fall guy for 
a bust on the dealer. The major hazard is getting burned. Buy from a friend or a 
reputable dealer. If you have to do business with a stranger, be extra careful. 
Never front money. One of the burn artist's tricks is to take your money, tell you 
to wait and split with your dough. There are various side show gimmicks each 
burn artist works. The most common is to ask you to walk with them a few blocks 
and then stop in front of an apartment building. He then tells you the dope is 
upstairs and asks you to hand over the money in advance. He explains that his 
partner is the real uptight 'cause they were raided once and won't let anybody in 
the pad. He takes your dough and disappears inside the building. Out the back 
door or up to the roof and into his getaway helicopter. You are left on the 
sidewalk with anxious eyes and that "can this really be happening to me" feeling. 
Another burn method is to substitute oregano, parsley or catnip for pot, camel 
shit for hash, saccharin or plain pills for acid. If you got burned for heroin or 
speed, you're better off being taken, because these are body-fuck drugs that can 
mess you up badly. The people that deal them are total pigs and should be 
regarded as such. When you're buying from strangers, you have a right to 
sample the merchandise free unless it's coke. Check the weight of grass with a 
small pocket scale. Feel the texture and check out how well it has been cleaned 
of seeds and twigs. Smoke a joint that is rolled from the stuff you get. Don't 
accept the dealer's sample that he pulled out of his pocket. When you are buying 
a large amount of acid, pick a sample. You should never buy acid from a stranger 
as it is too easy a burn. 
If you buy cocaine, bring along a black light. Only the imparities glow under its 
fluorescence, thus giving you an idea of the quality of the coke. Make sure it's the 
real thing. Sniffing coke can perforate your nasal passages, so be super 
moderate. Too much will kill you. A little bit goes a long way. 
Selling 
Dealing, although dangerous, is a tax-free way of surviving even though it 
borders on work. The best way to start is to save up a little bread and buy a 
larger quantity than you usually get. Then deal out smaller amounts to your 
friends. The fewer strangers you deal with, the safer you are. The price of dope 
varies with the amount of stuff on the market in your area, the heat the narks are 
bringing down and the connections you have. A rough scale, say, for pot is $20 
an ounce, $125 a pound and $230 a kilo (2.2 pounds). The price per ounce 
decreases depending on the amount you get. It's true you make more profit 
selling by the ounces, but the hassle is greater and the more contacts you must 
make increases the risk. Screwing your customers will prove to be bad karma 
(unless you consider dying groovy), so stick to honest dealing. Never deal from 
your pad and avoid keeping your stash there. Get into searching out the best 
markets which are generally in California, given its close proximity to good ol' 
Mexico. Kansas is a big distribution center for Mexican grass, too. You can ship 
the stuff (safer than carrying) via air freight anywhere in the country for about $30 
a trunk. Keep the sending and receiving end looking straight. We have one friend 
who wears a priest's outfit to ship and receive dope. In fact, every time we see 
nuns or priests on the street, we assume they're outlaws just on their way to the 
next deal or bombing. For all we know, the church actually is nothing but a huge 
dope ring in drag. Anybody gotten high off communion wafers lately? 
When you talk about deals on the phone, be cool. Make references to theater 
tickets or subscriptions. Don't keep extensive notes on your activities and 
contacts. Use code names where you can. Never deal with two other people 
present. Only you and the buyer should be in the immediate vicinity. Narks make 
busts in pairs so one can be the arresting officer and the other can be a court 
witness. Dealing is a paradox of unloading a good amount of shit but not trying to 
move too fast; of making ne contacts but being careful of strangers; of dealing 
high quality and low prices; and of being simultaneously bold and cautious. If you 
get nabbed, get the best lawyer who specializes in dope busts. First offenders 
rarely end up serving time, but it's a different story for repeaters. Know how 
punitive the courts are and which judges and prosecutors can be bought off. 
Never deal in the month before an election. For complete information on how to 
avoid getting busted and what to do if busted, read The Drug Bust (listed in 
appendix). 
Giving It Away 
Giving dope away can be a real mind-blower. Every dealer should submit to 
voluntary taxation by the new Nation. If you are a conscientious dealer, you 
should be willing and eager to give a good hunk of your stash away at special 
events or to groups into free distribution. You should also be able to give bread to 
bust trusts set up to bail out heads unable to get up the ransom money the 
whisky lush courts demand. Many groups have done huge mailings of joints to all 
sorts of people. A group in New York mailed 30,000 to people in the phone book 
on one Valentine's Day. A group in Los Angeles placed over 2,000 joints in 
library books and then advised kids to smoke a book during National Library 
Week. Be cool about even giving stuff away since that counts as dealing in most 
states. John Sinclair, Chairman of the White Panther Party, is serving 9Y 2 to 10 
years for giving away two joints. 
GROW YOUR OWN 
Pot is a weed and as such grows in all climates under every kind of soil 
condition. We have seen acres and acres of grass growing in Kansas, Iowa and 
New Jersey. If you're not located next door to a large pot field growing in the wild, 
maybe you would have some success in growing your own. It's well worth it to try 
your potluck! 
The first thing is to start with a bunch of good-quality seeds from grass that you 
really dig. Select the largest seeds and place them between two heavy-duty 
napkins or ink blotters in a pan. Soak the napkins with water until completely 
saturated. Cover the top of the pan or place it in a dark closet for three days or 
until a sprout about a half inch long appears from most of the seeds. 
During this incubation period, you can prepare the seedling bed. Use a low 
wooden box such as a tomato flat and fill it with an inch of gravel. Fill the rest of 
the box with some soil mixed with a small amount of fertilizer. Moisten the soil 
until water seeps out the bottom of the box, then level the soil making a flat 
surface. With a pencil, punch holes two inches apart in straight rows. You can get 
about 2 dozen in a tomato flat. 
When the incubation period is over, take those seeds that have an adequate 
sprout and plant one in each hole. The sprout goes down and the seed part 
should be a little above ground. Tamp the soil firmly (do not pack) around each 
plant as you insert the sprouts. 
The seedlings should remain in their boxes in a sunny window until about mid- 
May. They should receive enough water during this period to keep the soil moist. 
By the time they are ready to go into the ground, the green plants should be 
about six to eight inches tall. 
If it is late winter or early spring and you have a plot of land that gets enough sun 
and is sheltered from nosy neighbors, you should definitely grow grass in the 
great outdoors. 
One idea is to plant sunflowers in your garden as these grow taller than the pot 
plants and camouflage them from view. The best idea is to find some little-used 
field and plant a section of it. 
Prepare the land the way you would for any garden vegetable. Dig up the ground 
with a pitchfork or heavy duty rake, removing rocks. Rake the plot level and 
punch holes in the soil about three inches deep and about two feet apart in the 
same way you did in the seedling boxes. Remove the young plants from the box, 
being careful not to disturb the roots and keeping as much soil intact as possible. 
Transplant each plant into one of the punched-out holes and firmly press the soil 
to hold it in place. When all the plants are in the ground, water the entire area. 
Tend them the way you would any other garden. They should reach a height of 
about six feet by the end of the summer and be ready to harvest. 
If you don't have access to a field, you can grow good stuff right in your own 
closet or garage using artificial lighting. Transplant the plants into larger wooden 
boxes or flower boxes. Be sure and cover the bottom of each box with a few 
inches of pebbles or broken pottery before you add the soil. This will insure 
proper drainage. Fertilize the soil according to the instructions on the box and 
punch out holes in much the same way you would do if you were growing 
outside. After the young plants have been transplanted and watered thoroughly, 
you will have to rig up a lighting system. Use blue light bulbs, which are available 
at hardware stores for the first thirty days. These insure a shorter, sturdier stalk. 
Leave the lights on 24 hours a day and place them about a foot above the tops of 
the plants. If the plants begin to feel brittle or turn yellow at the edges, then the 
temperature is too hot. Use less illumination or raise the height of the lamp if this 
occurs. 
After the first thirty days, change to red bulbs and cut down the lighting time to 16 
hours a day. After a week, reduce the time to 14 hours and then on the third 
week to 12 hours. Maintain this lighting period until the plants flower. The female 
plants have a larger and heavier flower structure and the males are somewhat 
skimpy. The female plant produces the stronger grass and the choicest parts are 
the top leaves including the flowers. 
Inside or outside, the plants will be best if allowed to reach maturity, although 
they are smokeable at any point along the way. When you want to harvest the 
crop, wet the soil and pull out the entire plant. If you want to separate the top 
leaves from the rest, you can do so and make two qualities of grass. In any 
event, let the plants dry in the sun for two weeks until they are thoroughly dried 
out. If you want to hurry the drying process, you can do it in an oven using a very 
low heat for about twenty minutes. After you've completed the drying, you can 
"cure"' the grass by putting the plants in plastic bags and sprinkling drops of 
wine, rum or plain booze on them. This greatly increases the potency. 
There are two other ways that we know work to increase the potency of grass 
you grow or buy. One consists of digging a hole and burying a stash of grass 
wrapped in a plastic bag. A few months in the ground will produce a mouldy 
grass that is far fuckin' out. A quick method is to get a hunk of dry ice, put it in a 
metal container or box with a tight lid (taping the lid airtight helps), and sprinkling 
the grass on top. Allow it to sit tightly covered for about three days until all the dry 
ice evaporates. 
ASSORTED FREEBIES 
LAUNDRY 
Wait in a laundromat. Tell someone with a light load that you'll watch the machine 
for them if you can stick your clothes in with theirs. 
PETS 
Your local ASPCA will give you a free dog, cat, bird or other pet. Have them 
inspect and inoculate the animal which they will do free of charge. You can get 
free or very cheap medical care for your pet at a school for veterinary medicine. 
Underground newspapers often carry a free-pets column in the back pages. 
Snakes can be caught in any wooded area and they make great pets. You can 
collect insects pretty easy. Ants are unbelievable to watch. You can make a 
simple 3/4 inch wide glass case about a foot high, fill it with sand and start an ant 
colony. A library book will tell you how to care for them. 
Every year the National Park Service gives away surplus elks in order to keep 
the herds under its jurisdiction from outgrowing the amount of available land for 
grazing. Write to: Superintendent, Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone, 
Wyoming 83020. You must be prepared to pay the freight charges for shipping 
the animal and guarantee that you can provide enough grazing land to keep the 
big fellow happy. 
Under the same arrangement the government will send you a Free Buffalo. Write 
to: Office of Information, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20420. So 
many people have written them recently demanding their Free Buffalo, that they 
called a press conference to publicly attack the Yippies for creating chaos in the 
government. Don't take any buffalo shit from these petty bureaucrats, demand 
the real thing. Demand your Free Buffalo. 
Oh wow! Where 'd you get that cute little free buffalo? 
You can get a free 16mm movie about parakeets called "More Fun with 
Parakeets," by writing to: R.T. French Co., 9068 Mustard St., Rochester, New 
York 14609. This great film won an Academy Award for best picture of 1793. 
POSTERS 
Beautiful wall posters are available by writing to the National Tourist Agencies of 
various countries. Most are located between 42nd and 59th Streets on Fifth Ave. 
in New York City. You can find their addresses in the New York Yellow Pages 
under both National Tourist Agencies and Travel Agencies. There are over fifty of 
them. Prepare a form letter saying you are a high school geography teacher and 
would like some posters of the country to decorate your classroom. In a month 
you will be flooded with them. Airline companies also have colorful wall posters 
they send out free. 
SECURITY 
For this trick you need some money to begin with. Deposit it in a bank and return 
in a few weeks telling them you lost your bank book. They give you a card to fill 
out and sign and in a week you will receive another book. Now withdraw your 
money, leaving you with original money and a bank book showing a balance. 
You can use this as identification to prevent vagrancy busts when traveling, as 
collateral for bail, or for opening a charge account at a store. 
Another trick is to buy some American Travelers Checks. Wait a week and report 
your checks lost. They'll give you new ones to replace the missing ones. You 
spend your new checks and keep the ones you reported lost as security. This 
security is great for international travel especially at border crossings. If you 
want, you can spend the Travelers Checks by giving them to a friend to forge 
your name. Before you call the office to report the loss, call the police station and 
say you were mugged and your wallet was stolen. The agency always asks if you 
have reported the lost checks to the police, so you can safely answer yes. Never 
do this for more than five hundred dollars and never more than once with any 
one company. 
POSTAGE 
When mailing to the same city, address the envelope or package to yourself and 
put the name of the person you are sending it to where the return address 
generally goes. Mail it without postage and it will be "returned" to the sender. 
Because almost all letters are machine processed, any stamp that is the correct 
size will pass. Easter Seals and a variety of other type stamps usually get by the 
electronic scanner. If you put the stamp on a spot other than the far upper right 
corner, it will not be cancelled and can be used again by the person who gets 
your letter. If you have a friend working in a large corporation, you can run your 
organization's mail through their postage meter. 
Those ridiculous free introductory or subscription type letters that you get in the 
mail often have a postage-guaranteed return postcard for your convenience. The 
next one you get, paste it on a brick and drop it in the mailbox. The company is 
required by law to pay the postage. You can also get rid of all your garbage this 
way. 
MAPS 
You can get a free full-color World Atlas by writing to Hammond Inc. Maplewood, 
New Jersey 07040. 
MINISTRY 
Unquestionably one of the best deals going is becoming a minister in the 
Universal Life Church. They will send you absolutely free, bona fide ordination 
papers. These entitle you to all sorts of discounts and tax exemptions. Right now, 
sit down and write to Universal Life Church Inc., 601 3rd St., Modesto, California 
95351. Try cutting out the card on the following page and laminate it. Let us know 
how it works out. 
ATROCITIES 
Join the Army! 
VETERAN'S BENEFITS 
Write to the Veteran's Administration Information Service, Washington, D.C. 
20420 asking them for the free services they provide for veterans. Send fifteen 
cents to the Government Printing Office for their booklet Federal Benefits 
Available to Veterans and Their Dependents. 
WATCH 
A $330 Bulova sport timer accurate to 1/10 of a second will be lent free to judges 
and referees to time any amateur sporting event. Call your local authorized 
Bulova dealer and get one lent to you under a phony name. Tell them you want 
to time an orgy. 
VACATIONS 
There are many ways to take a free vacation, but here's one you might not have 
considered. It's an all-expenses paid trip to Las Vegas for absolutely nothing. Call 
a travel agent and request information about Las Vegas gambling junkets (you'll 
probably have to hunt around because this practice is being curtailed). Different 
hotels have different deals, but the average one runs something like this: If you 
agree to buy $500 worth of chips that can only be spent on gambling tables of 
the host hotel, they will fly you round trip, pay all hotel and food bills and provide 
you with a rented car. Go with a close friend and check into the hotel. Once at 
the roulette or craps table, you and your friend bet the same amount of chips 
against each other on even-paying chances. For example, he would bet on red 
and you on black. When either of you wins, you keep the house chips; when you 
lose, turn in the specially marked chips that cannot be cashed in. What you are 
doing is simply exchanging the chips you came with for house chips that you can 
cash in for real dough. Theoretically your two vacations should cost $23.00 if you 
do the betting at the crap table and $52.00 if you bet even chances at roulette. 
That is because the house wins if 0 or 00 comes up in roulette and if 12 comes 
up on the first roll of the dice, but it sure is a hell of a vacation for two for $23.00, 
and you get free champagne on some flights. 
You can get half a vacation free by going to the Amerikan Embassy or Consulate 
in the country you find yourself in and claim that you're destitute. There is a law 
on the books that says they have to send you away, but be persistent. Make up a 
story about how your parents are away from home traveling. Say you got 
mugged or something and you are about to go to the newspapers with your story. 
Eventually they'll get you a free plane ticket. They stamp your passport invalid 
though, and you have to pay the government back before you can use it again. 
DRINKS 
When hitching, it's a good idea to carry a bottle opener and a straw. You take the 
caps off soda bottles while they're still in the machine and drink them dry without 
ever touching the bottle. 
BURIALS 
For ways to avoid the high cost of dying in Amerika, write to: Continental 
Association, 39 East Van Buren St., Chicago, III. 60605. Send them $1 .00 for the 
Manual of Simple Burial and 250 for a list of Memorial Associates. 
ASTRODOME PICTURES 
Don't you just have to have a huge, glossy color photo of Houston's famed 
Astrodome to show all your friends? Use the teacher bit and write to: Greater 
Houston Convention and Visitors Council, 1600 Main St., Houston, Texas 77002. 
DIPLOMA 
Above the paper towel dispenser in a service station restroom was written: "San 
Francisco State Diplomas." If you really need a college or a high school diploma, 
send $2.00 to Glenco, Box 834, Warren, Michigan 48090. They send you one 
that looks real authentic. It ain't Harvard, but it looks good enough to frame and 
put on your wall. 
TOILETS 
Sneak Under! 
Tell It All, Brothers and Sisters 
STARTING A PRINTING WORKSHOP 
Leaflets, posters, newsletters, pamphlets and other printed matter are important 
to any revolution. A printing workshop is a definite need in all communities, 
regardless of size. It can vary from a garage with a mimeograph machine to a 
mammoth operation complete with printing presses and fancy photo equipment. 
With less than a hundred dollars and some space, you can begin this vital 
service. It'll take a while before you get into printing greenbacks, phony 
identification papers and credit cards like the big boys, but to walk a mile you 
must start with one step as Gutenberg once said. 
Paper 
The standard size for paper is 8/4" x 1 1". It comes 500 sheets to a "ream" and 10 
reams to a case. You want a 16-20 bond weight sheet. The higher weights are 
better if you are printing on both sides. You can purchase what are termed "odd 
lots" from most paper companies. This means that the colors will be assorted and 
some sheets will be frayed at the edges or wrinkled. Odd lots can be purchased 
at great discounts. Some places sell paper this way for 10% of the original price 
and for leaflets, different colors help. Check this out with paper suppliers in your 
area. 
Ink 
Inks come in pastes and liquids and are available in stationary stores and office 
supply houses. Each machine requires its own type ink, so learn what works best 
with the one you have. Colored ink is slightly more expensive but available for 
most machines. 
Stencils 
Each machine uses a particular size and style stencil. If you get stuck with the 
wrong kind and can't get out to correct the mistake, you can punch extra holes in 
the top, trim them with a scissors if they are too big or add strips of tape to the 
sides if too narrow. 
Be sure and use only the area that will fit on the paper you are using. Most 
stencils can be used for paper larger than standard size. Stencils will "cut" a lot 
neater if an electric typewriter is used. If you only have access to e manual 
machine, remove the ribbon so the keys will strike the stencil directly. A plastic 
sheet, provided by the supplier, can be inserted between the stencil and its 
backing to provide sharper cuts by the keys. If you hold the stencil up to a light, 
you should be able to clearly see the typing. If you can't, you'll have to apply 
more pressure. 
Sketches can be done with a ball point pen or special stylus directly on the 
stencil. If you're really rushed, or there isn't that much info to get on the leaflet, 
you can hand-print the text using these instruments. Take care not to tear the 
stencil. 
Mimeograph Machines 
The price of a new mimeograph runs from $200 to $1200, depending on how 
sophisticated a machine you need and can afford. A.B. Dick and Gestetner are 
the most popular brands. Many supply houses have used machines for sale. 
Check the classified section for bargains. See if any large corporations are 
moving, going out of business or have just had a fire. Chances are they'll be 
unloading printing equipment at cheap prices. Campaign offices of losing 
candidates often have mimeos to unload in November. Many supply houses 
have renting and leasing terms that you might be interested in considering. Have 
an idea of the work load and type of printing you'll be handling before you go 
hunting. Talk to someone who knows what they're doing before you lay down a 
lot of cash on a machine. 
Duplicators 
We prefer duplicators to mimeos even though the price is a little higher. They 
work faster, are easier to operate and print clearer leaflets. The Gestener Silk 
Screen Duplicator is the best bet. It turns out stuff almost as good as offset 
printing. You can do 10 thousand sheets an hour in an assortment of colors. 
Electronic Stencils 
If you use electronic stencils you can do solid lettering, line drawings, cartoons 
and black and white pictures with good contrast. To make an electronic stencil, 
you map out on a sheet of paper everything you want printed. This is a photo 
process, so make sure only what you want printed shows up on the sheet. You 
can use a light blue pencil for guide lines as it won't photograph, but be neat 
anyway. Printing shops will cut a stencil on a special machine for about $3.00. 
The Gestefax Electronic Stencil Cutter can be leased or rented in the same way 
as the duplicator. If you are doing a lot of printing for a number of different 
groups, this machine will eliminate plenty of hassle. The stencils cost about 200 
each and take about fifteen minutes to make. 
If you have an electronic stencil cutter, duplicator, electric typewriter and a cheap 
source of paper, you can do almost any printing job imaginable. Have a dual rate 
system: one for community groups and another for regular business orders. You 
can use the profits to go towards the purchasing of more equipment and to build 
toward the day when you can get your own offset press. 
Silk Screening 
Posters banners and shirts that are unbelievable can be printed by this exciting 
method. The process is easy to learn and teach. You'll need a fairly large area to 
work in since the posters have to be hung up to dry. Pick up any inexpensive 
paperback book on silk screening. The equipment costs less than $50.00 to 
begin. Once you get good at it, you can print complicated designs in a number of 
different colors, including portraits. 
UNDERGROUND NEWSPAPERS 
Food conspiracies, bust trusts, people's clinics and demonstrations are all part of 
the new Nation, but if asked to name the most important institution in our lives, 
one would have to say the underground newspaper. It keeps tuned in on what's 
going on in the community and around the world. Values, myths, symbols, and all 
the trappings of our culture are determined to a large extent by the underground 
press. Each office serves as a welcome mat for strangers, a meeting place for 
community organizers and a rallying force to fight pig repression. There are 
probably over 500 regularly publishing with readerships running from a few 
hundred to over 500,000. Most were started in the last three years. If your scene 
doesn't have a paper, you probably don't have a scene together. A firmly 
established paper can be started on about $2,500. Plan to begin with eight pages 
in black and white with a 5,000 copy run. Each such issue will cost about $300 to 
print. You should have six issues covered when you start. Another $700 will do 
for equipment. Offset printing is what you'll want to get from a commercial 
printing establishment. 
You need some space to start, but don't rush into setting up a storefront office 
until you feel the paper's going to be successful. A garage, barn or spare 
apartment room will do just fine. Good overhead fluorescent lighting, a few long 
tables, a bookcase, desk, chairs, possibly a phone and you are ready to start. 
Any typewriter will work, but you can rent an IBM Selectric typewriter with a 
deposit of $120.00 and payments of $20.00 per month. Leasing costs twice as 
much, but you'll own the machine when the payments are finished. The Selectric 
has interchangeable type that works on a ball system rather than the old-fashion 
keys. Each ball costs $18.00, so by getting a few you can vary the type the way a 
printer does. 
A light-table can make things a lot easier when it comes to layout. Simply build a 
box (3' x 4' is a good size, but the larger the better) out of V2" plywood. The back 
should be higher than the front to provide a sloping effect. The top should consist 
of a shelf of frosted glass. Get one strong enough to lean on. Inside the box, 
attach two fluorescent light fixtures to the walls or base. The whole light table 
should cost less than $25.00. That really is about all you need, except someone 
with a camera, a few good writers who will serve as reporters, an artistic person 
to take care of layout, and someone to hassle printing deals, advertising and 
distribution. Most people start by having everyone do everything. 
Layout 
A tabloid size paper is 9 7/8" x 14 5/8" with an inch left over on each side for 
margins. Columns typically are 3 1/4" allowing for three per page. Experience 
has found that this size is easy to lay out and more importantly, easy to read. 
There is an indirect ratio between readability and academic snobbishness. Avoid 
the textbook look. Remember, the New York Times in its low form represents the 
Death Kulture. 
Start off with a huge collection of old magazines and newspapers. You can cut 
up all sorts of letters, borders, designs and sketches and paste them together to 
make eye-catching headlines. Sheets of headline type are available in different 
styles from art stores for $1 .25 a sheet. Buy one of each type and then 
photograph several copies of each, bringing the price way down. The basic 
content in the prescribed column size should be banged out on the IBM. The 
columns can be clipped together with a clothespin to avoid confusion. Use a 
good heavy bond white opaque paper. 
All black and white photographs from newspapers and magazines can be used 
directly. Color pictures can also be used but it's tricky and you'll have to 
experiment a little to get an understanding of what colors photograph poorly. 
Glossy black and white photographs must be shot in halftones to keep the grey 
areas. You can have them processed at any photo lab. You might also need the 
photo lab for enlargements or reductions, so make contact and establish a good 
working relationship. 
An Exacto knife is available for 290 and you can get a package of 100 blades for 
$10.00. A few metal rulers, a good pair of scissors, some spray adhesive or 
rubber cement and you're ready to paste the pages that will make up the 
"dummy" that goes to the printer. Each page is laid out on special layout sheets 
with faint blue guide lines that don't photograph. Any large art supply store sells 
these sheets and all the other supplies. 
By working over a light-table, the paste-up can be done more professionally. 
Experiment with many different layouts for each page before finally pasting up 
the paper. Don't have a picture in the corner and the rest solid columns. Print can 
be run over pictures and sketches by preparing two sheets for that page and 
shooting background in half-tones. The columns don't have to be run straight up 
and down, but can run at different angles. The most newsworthy articles should 
be towards the front of the paper. The centerfold can be treated in an exciting 
manner. A good idea is to do the centerfold so that it can be used as a poster to 
put on a wall after the paper is read. If you have ads, they should be kept near 
the back. The masthead, which gives the staff, mailing address, and similar info, 
goes near the front. Your focus should be the local activities. A section should be 
reserved for a directly of local services and events. People giving things away 
should have a section. The rest really depends on the life style and politics of the 
staff. 
National stories can be supplied by one or more of the news services. Nothing in 
the underground press is copyrighted, so you can reprint an interesting article 
from another paper. It's customary to indicate what paper printed it first, or news 
service it was sent out by. Any underground paper has permission to reprint 
hunks of this book. 
Ads 
Most papers find it necessary to get some advertising to help defray the 
production costs. Some rely totally on subscription; some are outgrowths of 
organizations and still others are printed up and just handed out free. The ones 
with ads seem to have the longest life. Make up an ad rate before you put out the 
first issue. Ads are measured in inches of length. The width is understood by 
everyone to be the width of the column. If you use the 3 1 /4" column, however, 
you'll want to let potential advertisers know you have wide columns. 
The way to arrive at a reasonable rate is to estimate the total budget for each 
issue (adding some for overhead and labor), then each page and finally each 
column inch. After a little arithmetic you can get a good estimate of your printing 
cost per inch. Using our figures throughout this section, it should come to about 
$2.00 per inch. Double this figure and you'll arrive at the correct rate per 
advertising inch-$4.00. There should be special lower rates for large ads, such as 
half or full pages. There should also be a special arrangement for a continuous 
subscriber. If you have a classified section, another rate based on number of 
words or lines is constructed. A service charge is fixed if you make up the ad 
layout rather than the advertiser. The whole formula should be worked out and 
printed up before you lay out the first issue. 
The best place to get advertising is locally. Theaters, hip clothing stores, ice 
cream parlors, and record stores are among the type of advertisers you should 
approach. After you build up a circulation, you might want to seek out national 
advertisers. The Underground Press Syndicate, Box 26, Village Station, New 
York, NY 10014, can be joined for $25.00, no dues thereafter. They try to get 
national ads for you in addition to sending out a newsletter, a news service, and 
making sure you get free subscriptions to the other underground papers. The 
U.P.S. can also do many other things for you, like list you in their directory, obtain 
legal advice, and bring you together with other underground papers for mutual 
benefit and defense. Another way to get national advertising is to see who tends 
to advertise in other underground papers. Send the publicity department of these 
companies letters and samples of your paper. Never let ads make up more than 
half the paper. 
Distribution 
At the beginning you should aim for a bi-weekly paper with a gradual increase in 
the number of pages. The price should be about 250. Check out the local laws 
about selling papers on the street. It's probably allowed and is a neat way to get 
the paper around. Give half to the street hawkers. Representatives at high 
schools and colleges should be sought out. Bookstores and newsstands are 
good places to distribute. After your paper gets going well, you might try for 
national distribution. The Cosmep Newsletter is put out by the Committee of 
Small Magazines, Editors and Publishers, PO Box 1425, Buffalo, NY 14214. In 
addition to good tips if you want to start a small literary magazine or publish your 
own book, they provide an up-to-date list of small stores around the country that 
would be likely to carry your paper. Subscriptions should be sought in the paper 
itself. If you get a lot, check out second class mailing privileges. UPS can help 
with out-of-city distribution. 
If you're in a smaller town, you might have to shop around or go to another city to 
get printing done. Many printers print only pig swill, which brings up the point of 
getting busted for obscenity which can be pretty common. You probably should 
incorporate, but contact a sympathetic lawyer before you put out your first issue. 
During the summer there are usually a few alternative media conferences 
organized by one group or another. You can pick up valuable information and 
exchange ideas at these gatherings. UPS and the news services will keep you 
posted. Good luck and write on! 
HIGH SCHOOL PAPERS 
The usual high school paper is run by puppet lackeys of the administration. It 
avoids controversy, naughty language, and a host of other things foreign to the 4- 
H Club members the school is determined to mass produce. The only thing the 
staff is good at is kissing the principal's ass. Let's face it, the aim of a good high 
school newspaper should be to destroy the high school. Publishing and 
distributing a heavy paper isn't going to earn you the Junior Chamber of 
Commerce good citizenship award. You might have to be a little mysterious 
about who the staff is until you understand the ground rules and who controls the 
ballpark%the people or the principal. 
Many schools do not allow papers to be handed out on the school premises. 
These cases are generally won by the newspapers that take the school to court. 
You can challenge the rule and make the administration look like the dinosaurs 
they are by distributing sheets of paper with only your logo and the school rule 
printed. By gaining outside publicity for the first distribution of the paper, you 
might put the administration up tight about clamping down on you. It might be 
difficult to explain in civics class when they get to the freedom of the press stuff. 
Your paper should have one purpose in mind 3 /4to piss off the principal and 
radicalize the students. If you run into problems, seek out a sympathetic lawyer. 
You can get a helpful pamphlet from the ACLU, 156 5th Ave., New York, NY 
10010, called Academic Freedom in the Secondary Schools" for 250. 
Tell your lawyer about the most recent (July 10, 1970) decision of the United 
States District Court in Connecticut which ruled that the high school students of 
Rippowan High School in Stanford can publish independent newspapers without 
having the contents screened in advance by school officials. 
The same info for underground papers applies to high school rags, only the price 
should be much less if not free. To begin with, you might just mimeograph the 
first few issues before trying photo-offset printing. It is very important to get the 
readers behind you in case you have to go to war with the administration in order 
to survive. Maintain friendships with above ground reporters, the local 
underground paper and radical community groups for alliances. 
G.I. PAPERS 
A heavier scene than even the high schools exists in No-No Land of the military. 
None-the-less, against incredible odds, courageous G.l.'s both here and 
overseas have managed to put out a number of underground newspapers. If you 
are a G.I. interested in starting a paper, the first thing to do is seek out a few 
buddies who share your views on the military and arrange a meeting, preferably 
off the base. Once you have your group together, getting the paper published will 
be no problem. Keeping your staff secret, you can have one member contact with 
someone from a G.I. coffee house, anti-war organization or nearby underground 
newspaper. This civilian contact person will be in a position to raise the bread 
and arrange the printing and distribution of the paper. You can write one of the 
national G.I. newspaper organizations listed at the end of this section if you are 
unable to find help locally. The paper should be printed off the base. Government 
equipment should be avoided. 
Correspondence and subscriptions can be solicited through the use of a post 
office box. Such a box is inexpensive and secret (at least that's what the G.I. 
papers now publishing report) from military snoopers up tight about bad publicity 
if they get caught spying. If you are mailing the paper to other G.l.'s use first 
class mail and a plain envelope. This is advice to anybody sending stuff to a G.I. 
The mail is handled by "lifers" who will report troublemakers to their CO. 
(Commanding Officer) if they notice anti-war slogans on envelopes or dirty 
commie rags coming their way. 
You'll want to publish stuff relevant to the lives of the G:l.'s on your base. News 
of demonstrations, articles on the war, racism, counter-culture and vital info on 
how to bug the higher-ups and get out of the military service are all good. Get 
samples of other newspapers already in operation to get the flavor of writing that 
has become popular. 
Distributing the paper is really more of a problem than the publishing. Here you 
run smack into Catch 22, which says, "no printed matter may be distributed on a 
military base without prior written permission of the commanding officer." No 
such permit has been granted in military history. A few court battles have had 
limited success and you should go through the formality of obtaining a permit. 
Send the first issue of the paper to your CO. with a cover letter stating where 
and when you intend to distribute the paper on the base. In no part of the 
application should you list your names. Have a civilian, preferably a civil liberties 
lawyer, sign the declaration of intent. If more info is requested, go over it with the 
lawyer before responding, Natch, they're going to want to know who you are and 
where you get your bread, but fuck 'em. Whether or not you get a permit or have 
a successful court battle is pretty academic. If the military pigs catch you handing 
out an underground paper on the base, you're headed for trouble. Use civilian 
volunteers from your local peace group in as many public roles as possible. 
They'll be glad to help out. 
Print and distribute as many copies as you can rather than concentrating on an 
expensively printed paper with numerous pages. The very existence of the paper 
around the base is the most important info the paper can offer. Leave some in 
mess halls, theaters, benches, washrooms, and other suitable spots. Off base 
get the paper to sympathetic reporters, coffee houses, colleges and the like. 
Outside U.S.O. centers and bus terminals are a good place to get the paper out. 
Rely on donations, so you can make the paper free. Get it together. Demand the 
right to join the army of your choice. The People's Army! As Joe Hill said in one 
of his songs, "Yes, I'll pick up a gun but I won't guarantee which way I'll point it." 
NEWS SERVICES 
Aside from UPS, which is the association of papers, there are five news services 
that we know of that you might be interested in subscribing to for national stories, 
photos, production ideas, news of other papers and general movement dope. 
LNS is the best known. It sends out packets once a week that include about thirty 
pages with original articles, eye-witness reports, reprints from foreign papers and 
photographs. They tend to be heavily political rather than cultural and view 
themselves as molders of ideology rather than strictly a service organization of 
the underground papers. A subscription costs $15.00 per month, but if you're just 
starting out they are good about slow payments and such. 
You should get in the habit of sending special articles, in particular eye-witness 
accounts of events that other papers might use, to one or more of the news 
services for distribution. If you hear of an important event that you would like to 
cover in your newspaper, call the paper in that area for a quick report. They 
might send you photos if you agree to reciprocate.

SWITCHBOARDS 
A good way to quickly communicate what's coming down in the community is to 
build a telephone tree. It works on a pyramid system. A small core of people are 
responsible for placing five calls each. Each person on the line in turn calls five 
people and so on. If the system is prearranged correctly with adjustments made if 
some people don't answer the phone, you can have info transmitted to about a 
thousand people in less than an hour. A slower but more permanent method is to 
start a Switchboard. Basically, a Switchboard is a central telephone number or 
numbers that anybody can call night or day to get information. It can be as 
sophisticated as the community can support. The people that agree to answer 
the phone should have a complete knowledge of places, services and events 
happening in the community. Keep a complete updated file. The San Francisco 
Switchboard (see below) puts out an operator's manual explaining the 
organization and operation of a successful switchboard. They will send it out for 
120 postage. San Francisco has the longest and most extensive Switchboard 
operation. From time to time there are national conferences with local 
switchboards sending a rep.

Guerrilla Broadcasting 
GUERRILLA RADIO 
Under FCC Low Power Transmission Regulations, it is legal to broadcast on the 
AM band without even obtaining a license, if you transmit with 100 milliwatts of 
power or less on a free band space that doesn't interfere with a licensed station. 
You are further allowed up to a 12-foot antenna or the use of carrier-current 
transmission (regular electric wall outlets). Using this legal set-up, you can 
broadcast from a 2 to 20 block radius depending on how high up you can locate 
your antenna and the density of tall buildings in the area. 
Carrier-current broadcasting consists of plugging the transmitter into a regular 
wall socket. It draws power in the same way as any other electrical appliance, 
and feeds its signal into the power line allowing the broadcast to be heard on any 
AM radio tuned into the operating frequency. The transmitter can be adjusted to 
different frequencies until a clear band is located. The signal will travel over the 
electrical wiring until it hits a transformer where it will be erased. The trouble with 
this method is that in large cities, almost every large office or apartment building 
has a transformer. You should experiment with this method first, but if you are in 
a city, chances are you'll need an antenna rigged up on the roof. Anything over 
twelve feet is illegal, but practice has shown that the FCC won't hassle you if you 
don't have commercials and refrain from interfering with licensed broadcasts. 
There are some cats in Connecticut broadcasting illegally with a 100-foot 
antenna over a thirty mile radius for hours on end and nobody gives them any 
trouble. Naturally if you insist upon using dirty language, issuing calls to 
revolution, broadcasting bombing information, interfering with above ground 
stations and becoming too well known, the FCC is going to try and knock you 
out. There are penalties that have never been handed out of up to a year in jail. 
It's possible you could get hit with a conspiracy rap, which could make it a felony, 
but the opinion of movement lawyers now is a warning if you're caught once, and 
a possible fine with stiffer penalties possible for repeaters that are caught. 
If it gets really heavy, you could still broadcast for up to 15 minutes without being 
pin-pointed by the FCC sleuths. By locating your equipment in a panel truck and 
broadcasting from a fixed roof antenna, you can make it almost impossible for 
them to catch you by changing positions. 
There has been a variety of transmitting equipment used, and the most effective 
has been found to be an AM transmitter manufactured by Low Power 
Broadcasting Co., 520 Lincoln Highway, Frazer, Penn. 19355. Call Dick 
Crompton at (215 Nl 4-4096. The right transmitter will run about $200. If you plan 
to use carrier-current transmission you'll also need a capacitor that sells for $30. 
An antenna can be made out of aluminum tubing and antenna wiring available at 
any TV radio supply store (see diagram). You'll also need a good microphone 
that you can get for about $10. Naturally, equipment for heavier broadcasting is 
available if a member of your group has a license or good connections with 
someone who works in a large electronics supply house. Also with a good 
knowledge in the area you can build a transmitter for a fraction of the purchase 
price. You can always employ tape recorders, turntables and other broadcasting 
hardware depending on how much bread you have, how much stuff you have to 
hide (i.e., how legal your operation is) and the type of broadcasting you want to 
do. 
It is possible to extend your range by sending a signal over the telephone lines to 
other transmitters which will immediately rebroadcast. Several areas in a city 
could be linked together and even from one city to another. Theoretically, if 
enough people rig up transmitters and antennas at proper locations and 
everyone operates on the same band, it is possible to build a nation-wide 
people's network that is equally theoretically legal. 
Broadcasting, it should be remembered, is a one-way transmission of 
information. Communications which allow you to transmit and receive are illegal 
without a license (ham radio). 
GUERRILLA TELEVISION 
There are a number of outlaw radio projects going on around the country. Less 
frequent, but just as feasible, is a people's television network. Presently there are 
three basic types of TV systems: Broadcast, which is the sending of signals 
directly from a station's transmitter to home receiver sets; Cable, where the cable 
company employees extremely sensitive antenna to pick up broadcast 
transmissions and relay them and/or they originate and send them; and thirdly, 
Closed Circuit TV, such as the surveillance cameras in supermarkets, banks and 
apartment house lobbies. 
The third system as used by the pigs is of little concern, unless we are interested 
in not being photographed. The cameras can be temporarily knocked out of 
commission by flashing a bright light (flashbulb, cigarette lighter, etc.) directly in 
front of its lens. For our own purposes, closed-circuit TV can be employed for 
broadcasting rallies, rock concerts or teach-ins to other locations. The equipment 
is not that expensive to rent and easy to operate. Just contact the largest 
television or electronics store in your area and ask about it. There are also 
closed-circuit and cable systems that work in harmony to broadcast special 
shows to campuses and other institutions. Many new systems are being 
developed and will be in operation soon. 
Cable systems as such are in use only in a relatively few areas. They can be 
tapped either at the source or at any point along the cable by an engineer freak 
who knows what to do. The source is the best spot, since all the amplification 
and distribution equipment of the system is available at that point. Tapping along 
the cable itself can be a lot hairier, but more frustrating for the company when 
they try to trace you down. 
Standard broadcasting that is received on almost all living room sets works on an 
RF (radio frequency) signal sent out on various frequencies which correspond to 
the channels on the tuner. In no area of the country are all these channels used. 
This raises important political questions as to why people do not have the right to 
broadcast on unused channels. By getting hold of a TV camera (Sony and 
Panasonic are the best for the price) that has an RF output, you can send 
pictures to a TV set simply by placing the camera cable on or near the antenna of 
the receiver set. When the set is operating on the same channel as the camera, it 
will show what the camera sees. Used video tape recorders such as the Sony CV 
series that record and play back audio and video information are becoming more 
available. These too can be easily adapted to send RF signals the same as a live 
camera. 
Whether or not the program to be broadcasted is live or on tape, there are three 
steps to be taken in order to establish a people's TV network. First, you must 
convert the video and audio signals to an RF frequency modulated (FM) signal 
corresponding to the desired broadcast channel. We suggest for political and 
technical reasons that you pick one of the unused channels in your area to begin 
experimenting. The commercial stations have an extremely powerful signal and 
can usually override your small output. Given time and experience you might 
want to go into direct competition with the big boys on their own channel. It is 
entirely possible, say in a 10 to 20 block radius, to interrupt a presidential press- 
conference with more important news. Electronic companies, such as Jerrold 
Electronics Corp., 4th and Walnut Sts., Philadelphia, Pa., make equipment that 
can RF both video and audio information onto specific channels. The device 
you'd be interested in is called a cable driver or RF modulator. 
When the signal is in the RF state, it is already possible to broadcast very short 
distances. The second step is to amplify the signal so it will reach as far as 
possible. A linear amplifier of the proper frequency is required for this job. The 
stronger the amplifier the farther and more powerful the signal. A 1 0-watt job will 
cover approximately 5 miles (line of sight) in area. Linear amplifiers are not that 
easily available, but they can be constructed with some electrical engineering 
knowledge. 
The third step is the antenna, which if the whole system is to be mobile to avoid 
detection, is going to involve some experimentation and possible camouflage. 
Two things to keep in mind about an antenna are that it should be what is 
technically referred to as a "di-pole" antenna (see diagram) and since TV signals 
travel on line of sight, it is important to place the antenna as high as possible. 
Although it hasn't been done in practice, it certainly is possible to reflect pirate 
signals off an make equipment that can RF both video and audio existing 
antenna of a commercial network. This requires a full knowledge of broadcasting; 
however, any amateur can rig up an antenna, attach it to a helium balloon and 
get it plenty high. For most, the roof of a tall building will suffice. If you're really 
uptight about your operation, the antenna can be hidden with a fake cardboard 
chimney. 
We realize becoming TV guerrillas is not everyone's trip, but a small band with a 
few grand can indeed pull it off. There are a lot of technical freaks hanging 
around recording studios, guitar shops, hi-fi stores and engineering schools that 
can be turned on to the project. By showing them the guidelines laid out here, 
they can help you assemble and build various components that are difficult to 
purchase (i.e., the linear amplifier). Naturally, by building some of the 
components, the cost of the operation is kept way down. Equipment can be 
purchased in selective electronics stores. You'll need a camera, VTR, RF 
modulator, linear amplifier and antenna. Also a generator, voltage regulator and 
an alternator if you want the station to be mobile. One of the best sources of 
information on both television and radio broadcasting is the Radio Amateur's 
Handbook published by the American Radio Relay League, Newington, Conn. 
0661 1 and available for $4.50. The handbook gives a complete course in 
electronics and the latest information on all techniques and equipment related to 
broadcasting. Back issues have easy to read do-it-yourself TV transmitter 
diagrams and instructions. Also available is a publication called Radical 
Software, put out by Raindance Corp., 24 E. 22nd St., New York, N.Y., with the 
latest info on all types of alternative communications. 
Guerrilla TV is the vanguard of the communications revolution, rather than the 
avant-garde cellophane light shows and the weekend conferences. One pirate 
picture on the sets in Amerika's living rooms is worth a thousand wasted words. 
With the fundamentals in this field mastered, you can rig up all sorts of shit. 
Cheap twenty-dollar tape recorders can be purchased and outfitted with a series 
of small loud-speakers. Concealed in a school auditorium or other large hall, 
such a system can blast out any message or music you wish to play. The 
administration will go insane trying to locate the operation if it is well hidden. We 
know two cats who rigged a church with this type of setup and a timing device. 
Right in the middle of the sermon, on came Radio Heaven and said stuff like 
"Come on preacher, this is God, you don't believe all that crap now, do you?" It 
made for an exciting Sunday service, all right. You can build a miniature 
transmitter and with a small magnet attach it to the underbelly of a police car to 
keep track of where it's going. This would only be practical in a small town or on 
a campus where there are only a few security guards or patrol vehicles. If you 
rigged a small tape recorder to the transmitter and tuned it to a popular AM band, 
the patrol car as it rode around could actually broadcast the guerrilla message 
you prerecorded. Wouldn't they be surprised when they found out how you did it? 
You can get a "Bumper Beeper" and receiver that are constructed by 
professionals for use by private detectives. The dual unit costs close to $400. If 
you've got that kind of bread, you can write John Bomar, 6838 No. 3rd Ave., 
Phoenix, Arizona 85013 for a catalogue and literature. 
Even though there are laws governing the area of sneaky surveillance, telephone 
taps, tracking devices and the like, a number of enterprising firms produce an 
unbelievable array of electronic hardware that allows you to match Big Brother's 
ears and eyes. Sugar cube transmitters, tie clasp microphones, phone taps, tape 
recorders that work in a hollowed-out book and other Brave New World 
equipment is available from the following places. Send for their catalogues just to 
marvel at the level of technology. R. B. Clifton, 1150 NW 7th Ave., Miami, Fla. 
33168; Electrolab Corp., Bank of Stateboro Building, Stateboro, Ga. 30458; or 
Tracer Investigative Products, Inc., 256 Worth. Ave., Palm, Beach, Fla. 33482. 
By the way, you can pick up Radio Hanoi on a short wave radio every day from 
3:00 to 3:30 PM at 15013 kilocycles on the 19 meter band. 
Negotiating a permit with city officials 
Demonstrations 
Demonstrations always will be an important form of protest. The structure can 
vary from a rally or teach-in to a massive civil disobedience such as the 
confronting of the warmakers at the Pentagon or a smoke-in. A demonstration is 
different from other forms of warfare because it invites people other than those 
planning the action via publicity to participate. It also is basically non-violent in 
nature. A complete understanding of the use of media is necessary to create the 
publicity needed to get the word out. Numbers of people are only one of the 
many factors in an effective demonstration. The timing, choice of target and 
tactics to be employed are equally important. There have been demonstrations of 
400,000 that are hardly remembered and demonstrations of a few dozen that 
were remarkably effective. Often the critical element involved is the theater. 
Those who say a demonstration should be concerned with education rather than 
theater don't understand either and will never organize a successful 
demonstration, or for that matter, a successful revolution. Publicity includes 
everything from buttons and leaflets to press conferences. You should be in 
touch with the best artists you can locate to design the visual props. Posters can 
be silk screened very cheaply and people can be taught to do it in a very short 
time. Buttons have to be purchased. The cheapest are those printed directly on 
the metal. The paint rubs off after a while, but they are ideal for mass 
demonstrations. You can print 10,000 for about $250.00. Leaflets, like posters, 
should be well designed. 
One way of getting publicity is to negotiate with the city for permits. Again, this 
raises political questions, but there is not doubt one reason for engaging in 
permit discussions is for added publicity. 
The date, time and place of the demonstration all have to be chosen with skill. 
Know the projected weather reports. Pick a time and day of the week that are 
convenient to most people. Make sure the place itself adds some meaning to the 
message. Don't have a demonstration just because that's the way it's always 
been done. It is only one type of weapon and should be used as such. On the 
other hand, don't dismiss demonstrations because they have always turned out 
boring. You and your group can plan a demonstration within the demonstration 
more accurately. Also don't tend to dismiss demonstrations outright because the 
repression is too great. During World War II the Danes held street 
demonstrations against the Nazis who occupied their country. Even today there 
are public demonstrations against the Vietnam War in downtown Saigon. 
Repression is there, but overestimating it is more a tactical blunder than the 
reverse. None the less, it's wise to go to all demonstrations prepared for a 
vamping by the pigs. 
DRESS 
Most vamping is accompanied by clubbing, rough shoving and dragging, gassing 
and occasional buckshot or rifle fire. The clothing you wear should offer you the 
best protection possible, yet be light weight enough to allow you to be highly 
mobile. CS and CN are by far the most commonly employed tear gas 
dispersibles. Occasionally they are combined with pepper gas to give better 
results. Pepper gas is a nerve irritant that affects exposed areas of the skin. 
Clothing that is tight fitting and covers as much of the body surface as possible is 
advisable. This also offers some protection if you are dragged along the ground. 
Gloves come in handy as protection and if you want to pick up gas canisters and 
throw them back at the pigs or chuck them through a store window. 
Your shoes should be high sneakers for running or boots for kicking. Hiking boots 
sold in army surplus stores serve both purposes and are your best selection for 
street action. Men should wear a jock strap or protective cup. Rib guards can be 
purchased for about $6.00 at any sporting goods store. Shoulder pads and leg 
pads are also available, but unless you expect heavy fighting and are used to 
wearing this clumsy street armor, you'll be better off without it. 
HELMETS 
Everyone should have a helmet. Your head sticks out above the swarming crowd 
and dents like a tin can. Protect it! The type of helmet you get depends on what 
you can afford and how often you'll be using it. The cheapest helmet available is 
a heavy steel tank model. This one is good because it offers ear protection and 
has a built-in suspension system to absorb the blow. It is also bullet proof. It's 
disadvantages are that it only comes in large sizes and is the heaviest thing you'll 
ever have on your head. It costs about $3.00. For $5.00 you can get a Civil 
Defense helmet made for officers. It's much lighter, but doesn't offer protection 
for the ears. It has a good suspension system. If you get this model, paint it a 
dark color before using it and you'll be less conspicuous. Our fashion consultants 
suggest anarchy black. 
Construction helmets or "hard hats" run between $8.00 and $10.00, depending 
on the type of suspension system and material used. They are good for women 
because they are extremely lightweight. The aluminum ones dent if struck 
repeatedly and the fiberglass type can crack. Also they offer no ear protection. If 
you prefer one of these you should find a way to attach a chin or neck strap so 
you won't lose it while you run. If you get a hard hat, make sure you remove the 
hard head before you take it home. 
Probably the all-around good deal for the money is the standard M-1 Army issue 
helmet. These vary in quality and price, depending on age and condition. They 
run from $2.00 to $10.00. Make sure the one you get has a liner with webbing 
that fits well or is adjustable and has a chin strap. Their main disadvantage is that 
they are bulky and heavy. 
The snappiest demonstrators use the familiar motorcycle crash helmet. They are 
the highest in price, running from $10.00 to as high as $40.00. Being made of 
fiberglass, they are extremely lightweight. They have a heavy-duty strap built in 
and they can be gotten to fit quite snugly around the head. They offer excellent 
ear protection. The foam rubber insulation is better than a webbing system, and 
will certainly cushion most blows. Being made of fiberglass, a few have been 
known to crack under repeated blows, but that is extremely rare. Most come with 
plastic face guards that offer a little added protection. Get only those with 
removable ones since you might want to make use of a gas mask. 
GAS MASKS 
Ski goggles or the face visor on a crash helmet will protect against Mace but will 
offer no protection against the chemical warfare gasses being increasingly used 
by pigs to dispose crowds. For this protection you'll need a gasmask. All the 
masks discussed give ideal protection against the gasses mentioned in the chart 
if used properly. If you do not have a gas mask, you should at least get a supply 
of surgical masks from a hospital supply store and a plastic bag filled with water 
and a cloth. 
The familiar World War II Army gas mask with the filter in a long nose unit sells 
new (which is the only way gas masks can be sold) for about $5.00. Its 
disadvantages are that it doesn't cover the whole face, is easy to grab and pull 
off and the awkwardly placed filter makes running difficult. The Officer Civil 
Defense unit sells for the same price and overcomes the disadvantages of the 
World War II Army model. Most National Guard units use this type of mask. It 
offers full face protection, is lightweight and the filter canister is conveniently 
located. Also the adjustable straps make for a nice tight fit. The U.S.A. Protective 
Field Combat Mask M9A1 offers the same type protection as the OCD, but costs 
twice as much. Its advantage is that you can get new filter canisters when the 
chemicals in the one you are using becomes ineffective. New filters cost about 
$1 .50. When you buy a mask, be sure and inquire if the filter has replacements. 
To get maximum efficiency out of a mask it needs an active chemical filter. 
The U.S. Navy ND Mark IV Mask is the most effective gas mask available. It has 
replaceable filter canisters and fits snugly to the head. It costs about $12.00. Its 
disadvantage is its dual tube filter system, which is somewhat bulky. Fix it so the 
canister rests on the back of your needs. It's more difficult to grab and easier to 
run. 
When you get your gas mask home, try it out to get the feeling of using it. Make 
sure the fit is good and snug. Purchase an anti-fog cloth for 25 cents where you 
got the mask. Wipe the inside of the eye pieces before wearing to prevent the 
glasses from clouding. Another good reason for wearing a mask is that it offers 
anonymity. Helmets, gas masks and a host of other valuable equipment are 
available at any large Army-Navy surplus store. Kaufman's Surplus and Arms, 
Inc., 623 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10012 is very well stocked. For 75 cents you 
can get their catalogue and order through the mail. It's in New York though and 
probably more expensive than a store in your locale. The surplus stores buy from 
wholesale distributors themselves, who in turn buy directly from the military. If 
you know a soldier or someone who is married to a soldier, they have access to 
the Post Dispensary or PX and can get all sorts of stuff at nothing prices. For 20 
cents you can get an invaluable pamphlet from the Government Printing Office 
called How to Buy Surplus Personal Property. It has a complete list of regional 
surplus wholesalers. The closest one in the Northeast is the Naval Supply 
Center, Building 652, U.S. Naval Base, Philadelphia, Pa. and in Northern 
California, the Naval Supply Center, Building 502, Oakland, California. You can 
order by mail or in person and the prices are very low, even though it isn't as 
good as the stuff our brothers and sisters in the Viet Cong rip-off. 
WALKIE-TALKIES 
You should always go to a demonstration in a small group that stays in contact 
with each other until the demonstration is over. One way to keep in touch is to 
use walkie-talkies. No matter how heavy the vamping gets or how spread out are 
the crowds, you'll be able to communicate with these lightweight effective 
portable devices. The only disadvantage is cost. A half decent unit costs at least 
$18.00. It should have a minimum of 9 transistors and 100 milliwatts, although 
walkie-talkies can go as high as 5 watts and broadcast over 2 miles. Anything 
under 1 watt will not broadcast over V2 mile and considerably less in an area with 
tall buildings. The best unit you can buy runs about $300.00. If you ever deck a 
pig, steal his walkie-talkie even before you take his gun. A good rule is to avoid 
the bargain gyp-joints and go to a place that deals in electronic equipment. 
The important thing to realize about all walkie-talkie networks is that if anyone 
can talk, anyone else can listen and vice versa. This applies to pigs as well as 
us. All walkie-talkies work on the Civilian Band which has 23 channels. The 
cheaper units are preset to channel 9 or 1 1 . The pigs broadcast on higher 
channels, usually channel 22. More expensive sets can operate on alternative 
channels. By removing the front of the set, you can adjust the transmitter and 
receiver to pick up and receive police communications. Don't screw around with 
the inside though, unless you know what you are doing. Allied Radio, 100 N. 
Western Ave., Chicago, Illinois 60680, will send you a good free catalogue, as 
will most large electronic stores. Consider buying a number of sets and ask about 
group discounts. Practice a number of times before you actually use walkie- 
talkies in real action. Develop code names and words just like the pigs do. Once 
you get acquainted with this method of communications in the streets, you'll 
never get cut off from the action. Watch out in close combat though. The pigs 
always try to smash any electronic gear. 
OTHER EQUIPMENT 
A sign can be used to ward off blows. Staple it to a good strong pole that you can 
use as a weapon if need be. Chains make good belts, as do garrisons with the 
buckles sharpened. A tightly rolled-up magazine or newspaper also can be used 
as a defensive weapon. 
Someone in your group should carry a first aid kit. A Medical Emergency 
Aeronautic Kit, which costs about $5.00 has a perfect carrying bag for street 
action. 
Ideally you should visit the proposed site of the demonstration before it actually 
takes place. This way you'll have an idea of the terrain and the type of 
containment the police will be using. Someone in your group should mimeograph 
a map of the immediate vicinity which each person should carry. Alternative 
actions and a rendezvous point should be worked out. Everyone should have two 
numbers written on their arm, a coordination center number and the number of a 
local lawyer or legal defense committee. You should not take your personal 
phone books to demonstrations. If you get busted, pigs can get mighty Nosy 
when it comes to phone books. Any sharp objects can be construed as weapons. 
Women should not wear earrings or other jewelry and should tie their hair up to 
tuck it under a helmet. Wear a belt that you can use as a tourniquet. False teeth 
and contact lenses should be left at home if possible. You can choke on false 
teeth if you receive a sharp blow while running. Contact lenses can complicate 
eye damage if gas or Mace is used. 
If it really looks heavy, you might want to pick up on a lightweight adjustable 
bullet-proof vest, available for $14.95 from Surplus Distributors, Inc., 6279 Van 
Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys, California 91401. Remember what the Boy Scouts say 
when they go camping: "Be Prepared". When you go to demonstrations you 
should be prepared for a lot more than speeches. The pigs will be. 
Trashing 
Ever since the Chicago pigs brutalized the demonstrators in August of 1968, 
young people have been read to vent their rage over Amerika's inhumanity by 
using more daring tactics than basic demonstrations. There is a growing 
willingness to do battle with the pigs in the streets and at the same time to inflict 
property damage. It's not exactly rioting and it's not exactly guerrilla warfare; it 
has come to be called "Trashing." Most trashing is of a primitive nature with the 
pigs having the weapon and strategy advantage. Most trashers rely on quick 
young legs and a nearby rock. By developing simple gang strategy and 
becoming acquainted with some rudimentary weapons and combat techniques, 
the odds can be shifted considerably. 
Remember, pigs have small brains and move slowly. All formations, signals, 
codes and other procedures they use have to be uniform and simplistic. The 
Army Plan for Containment and Control of Civil Disorders, published by the 
Government Printing Office, contains the basic thinking for all city, county and 
state storm troopers. A trip to the library and a look at any basic text in 
criminology will help considerably in gaining an understanding of how pigs act in 
the street. If you study up, you'll find you can, with the aid of a bullhorn or 
properly adjusted walkie-talkie, fuck up many intricate pig formations. "Left flank- 
right turn!" said authoritatively into a bullhorn pointed in the right direction will 
yield all sorts of wild results. 
You should trash with a group using a buddy system to keep track of each other. 
If someone is caught by a pig, other should immediately rush to the rescue if it's 
possible to do so without sustaining too many losses. If an arrest is made, 
someone from your gang should take responsibility for seeing to it that a lawyer 
and bail bread are taken care of. Never abandon a member of your gang. 
Avoid fighting in close quarters. You run less risk by throwing an object than by 
personally delivering the blow with a weapon you hold in your hand. We suppose 
this is what pigs refer to as "duty fighting." All revolutionaries fight dirt in the eyes 
of the oppressors. The British accused the Minutemen of Lexington and Concord 
of fighting dirty by hiding behind trees. The U.S. Army accuses the Viet Cong of 
fighting dirty when they rub a pointed bamboo shoot in infected shit and use it as 
a land mine. Mayor Daley says the Yippies squirted hair spray and used golf 
balls with spikes in them against his innocent blue boys. No one ever accused 
the U.S. of being sneaky for using an airforce in Southeast Asia or the Illinois 
State Attorney's office of fighting dirty when it murdered Fred Hampton and Mark 
Clark while they lay in bed. We say: all power to the dirty fighters! 
WEAPONS FOR STREET FIGHTING 
Spray Cans 
These are a very effective and educating method of property destruction. If a 
liberated zone has been established or you find yourself on a quiet street away 
from the thick of things, pretty up the neighborhood. Slogans and symbols can be 
sprayed on rough surfaces such as brick or concrete walls that are a real bitch to 
remove unless expensive sandblasting is used. 
The Slingshot 
This is probably the ideal street weapon for the swarms of little Davids that are 
out to down the Goliaths of Pigdom. It is cheap, legal to carry, silent, fast-loading 
and any right size rock will do for a missile. You can find them at hobby shops 
and large sporting goods stores, especially those that deal in hunting supplies. 
Wrist-Rocket makes a powerful and accurate slingshot for $2.50. The Whamo 
Sportsman is not as good but half the price. By selecting the right "Y" shaped 
branch, you can fashion a home-made one by using a strip of rubber cut from the 
inner tube of a tue as the sling. A few hours of shooting stones at cans in the 
back yard or up on the roof will make you marksman enough for those fat bank 
windows and even fatter pigs. 
Slings 
A sling is a home-made weapon consisting of two lengths of heavy-duty cord 
each attached securely at one end to a leather patch that serves as a pocket to 
cradle the rock. Place the rock in the pouch and grab the two pieces of cord 
firmly in your hand. Whirl the rock round and round until gravity holds it firmly in 
the pouch. When you feel you have things under control, let one end of the cord 
go and the rock will fly out at an incredible speed. You should avoid using the 
sling in a thick crowd (rooftop shooting is best). Practice is definitely needed to 
gain any degree of accuracy. 
Boomerangs 
The boomerang is a neat weapon for street fighting and is as easy to master as 
the Frisbee. There is a great psychological effect in using exotic weapons such 
as this. You can buy one at large hobby stores. On the East Coast you can get 
one from Sportscraft, Bergenfield, New Jersey, for $2.69, and on the West Coast 
from Whamo, 835 El Monte St., San Gabriel, Calif., for $1.10. 
Flash Guns 
Electric battery-operated flash guns are available that will blind a power-crazy 
pig, thus distracting him long enough to rescue a captured comrade. Check out 
camping and boating supply stores. 
Tear Gas and Mace 
Personalized tear gas and mace dispensers are available for self-defense 
against muggers. Well, isn't a pig just an extra vicious mugger? Write J. P. Darby, 
8813 New Hyde Park, New York, N.Y. 1 1040 for a variety of types and prices. 
Tear gas shells are available for 12 gauge shotguns and .38 Special handguns, 
but it is highly inadvisable to bring guns to street actions. A far better weapon is a 
specially built projection device that shoots tear gas shells. Hercules Gas- 
Munitions Corp., 5501 No. Broadway, Chicago, III., sells compact units complete 
with cartridges for $6.95 that will fire up to 20 feet. Penguin Associates, Inc., 
Pennsylvania Avenue, Malvern, Penn., also has a variety of tear-gas propellant 
devices including a combination tear gas-billyclub item. All these companies will 
supply a catalogue and price list on request. Some states have laws against 
civilian use of tear gas devices. New York is one of them, and unfortunately 
these companies will not ship to states that forbid usage. If you want any of these 
items, and your state has restrictions, have a sister or brother in a neighboring 
state order for you. Just latching onto these catalogues can be a trip and a half in 
terms of getting your imagination hopping. For example Raid, Black Flag and 
other insecticides shoot a 7 to 10 foot stream that burns the eyes. You can also 
dissolve Drano in water and squirt it from an ordinary plastic water pistol. That 
makes a highly effective defensive weapon. A phony letterhead of a Civil 
Defense unit will help in getting heavier anti-personal weapons of a defensive 
nature. 
Anti-Tire Weapons 
Don't believe all those bullshit tire ads that make tires seem like the Superman of 
the streets. Roofing nails spread out on the street are effective in stopping a 
patrol car. A nail sticking out from a strong piece of wood wedged under a rear 
tire will work as effectively as a bazooka. An ice pick will do the trick repeatedly 
but you've got to have a strong arm to strike home. Sugar in the gas tank of a pig 
vehicle will really fuck-up the engine. 
Authentic Pig Game 
If you really get into it, you'll probably want to be sd heavily prepared for trashing 
as are the pigs. Wouldn't you just know that the largest supplier of equipment to 
police in the world is in Chicago. Kale's, 550 W. Roosevelt Rd., Chicago, III. 
60607, will send you, on request, the most complete catalogue you can get for 
trashing. Actual police uniforms, super-riot helmets, persuaders chemical mace, 
a knuckle sap, which is a glove with powdered lead, billy clubs, secret holsters, a 
three-in-one mob stick that spits Mace, emits an electric shock and allows you to 
club to death a charging rhinoceros. You can also get the latest in handcuffs and 
other security devices. This catalogue is a must for the love-child of the 70's. If 
we want to get high we're going to have to fight our way up. 
KNIFE FIGHTING 
Probably one of the most favored street weapons of all time is the good old 
"shiv," "blade," "toe-jabber" or whatever you choose to call a good sticker. 
Remembering that today's pig is tomorrow's bacon, it's good to know a few 
handy slicing tips. The first thing to learn is the local laws regarding the 
possession of knives. The laws on possession are of the "Catch-22" vagueness. 
Cops can arrest you for having a small pocket knife and claim you have a 
concealed and deadly weapon in your possession. Here, as in most cases of law, 
it's not what you are doing, it's who's doing the what that counts. All areas, 
however, usually have a limit on length such as blades under 4" or 6" are legal 
and anything over that length concealed on a person can be considered illegal. 
Asking some hip lawyers can help here. 
Unfortunately, the best fighting knives are illegal. Switchblades (and stilettos) 
because they can so quickly spring into operation, are great weapons that are 
outlawed in all states. If you want to risk the consequences, however, you can 
readily purchase these weapons once you learn how to contact the criminal 
underworld or in most foreign countries. If both of these fail, go to any pawnshop, 
look in the window, and take our choice of lethal, illegal knives. 
A flat gravity knife, available in most army surplus and pawn shops would be the 
best type available in regular over-the-counter buying. It's flat style makes for 
easy concealment and comfort when kept in a pocket or boot. It can be greased 
and the rear "heel" of the blade can be filed down to make it fly open with a flick 
of the wrist. A little practice here will be very useful. 
Most inexperienced knife fighters use a blade incorrectly. Having seen too many 
Jim Bowies slash their way through walls of human flesh, they persist in carrying 
on this inane tradition. Overhead and uppercut slashes are a waste of energy 
and blade power. The correct method is to hold the knife in a natural, firm grip 
and jab straight ahead at waist level with the arm extending full length each time. 
This fencing style allows for the maximum reach of arm and blade. By 
concentrating the point of the knife directly at the target, you make defense 
against such an attack difficult. Work out with this jabbing method in front of a 
mirror and in a few days you'll get it down pretty well. 
How to tie a knot with your toes 
UNARMED DEFENSE 
Let's face it, when it comes to trashing in the streets, our success is going to 
depend on our cunning and speed rather than our strength and power. Our side 
is all quarterbacks, and the pigs have nothing but linemen. They are clumsy, 
slobbish brutes that would be lost without their guns, clubs and toy whistles. 
When one grabs you for an arrest, you can with a little effort, make him let go. In 
the confusion of all the street action, you will then be able to manage your 
getaway. 
There are a variety of defensive twists and pulls that are easy to master by 
reading a good, easily understandable book on the subject, such as George 
Hunter's How To Defend Yourself (see appendix). If a pig grabs you by the wrist 
you can break the grip by twisting against his thumb. Try this on yourself by 
grabbing one wrist with your hand. See how difficult it is to hold someone who 
works against the thumb. If he grabs you around the waist or neck, you can grab 
his thumbs or another finger and sharply bend it backwards. By concentrating all 
your energy on one little finger, you can inflict pain and cause the grip to be 
broken. 
There are a variety of points on the body where a firm amount of pressure 
skillfully directed will induce severe pain. A grip, for example, can be broken by 
jabbing your finger firmly between the pig's knuckles. (Nothing like chopped 
pigknuckles.) Feel directly under your chin in back of the jawbone until your 
finger rests in the V area, press firmly upward and backward towards the center 
of the head. There is also a very vulnerable spot right behind the ear lobe. Stick 
your fingers there and see. Get the point! 
In addition to pressure points, there are places in the body where a sharp, well- 
directed whack with the side of a rigidly held palm can easily disable a person. 
Performed by an expert, such a blow can even be lethal. Try making such a rigid 
palm and practice these judo chops. The fist is a ridiculous weapon to use. It's 
fleshy, the blow is distributed over too wide an area to have any real effect and 
the knuckles break easily. You will have to train yourself to use judo chops 
instinctively, but it will prove quite worthwhile if you are ever in trouble. A good 
place to aim for is directly in the center of the chest cavity at its lowest point. 
Draw a straight line up about six inches starting from your belly button, and you 
can feel the point. The Adam's Apple in the center of the neck and the back of 
the neck at the top of the spinal column are also extremely vulnerable spots. With 
the side of your palm, press firmly the spot directly below your nose and above 
your upper lip. You can easily get an idea of what a short, forceful chop in this 
area would do. The side of the head in front of the ear is also a good place to aim 
your blow. 
In addition to jabs, chops, twists, squeezes and bites, you ought to gain some 
mastery of kneeing and kicking. If you are being held in close and facing the 
porker, the old familiar knee-in-the-nuts will produce remarkable results. A 
feinting motion with the head before the knee is delivered will produce a reflexive 
reaction from your opponent that will leave his groin totally unprotected. Ouch! 
Whether he has you from the front or the back, he is little prepared to defend 
against a skillfully aimed kick. The best way is to forcefully scrape the side of 
your shoe downward along the shinbone, beginning just below the knee and 
ending with a hard stomp on the instep of the foot. Just try this with the side of 
your hand and you will get an idea of the damage you can inflict with this scrape 
and stomp method. Another good place to kick and often the only spot accessible 
is the side of the knee. Even a half successful blow here will topple the biggest of 
honkers. Any of these easy to learn techniques of unarmed self defense will fulfill 
the old nursery rhyme that goes: 
Catch a piggy by the toe 
When he hollers 
Let him go 
Out pops Y-O-U 
GENERAL STRATEGY RAP 
The guideline in trashing is to try and do as much property destruction as 
possible without getting caught or hurt. The best buildings to trash in terms of not 
alienating too many of those not yet clued into revolutionary violence, are the 
most piggy symbols of violence you can find. Banks, large corporations, 
especially those that participate heavily in supporting the U.S. armed forces, 
federal buildings, courthouses, police stations, and Selective Service centers are 
all good targets. On campuses, buildings that are noted for warfare research and 
ROTC training are best. When it comes to automobiles, choose only police 
vehicles and very expensive cars such as Lamborghinis and Iso Grifos. Every 
rock or molotov cocktail thrown should make a very obvious political point. 
Random violence produces random propaganda results. Why waste even a 
rock? 
When you know there is going to be a rough street scene developing, don't play 
into the pig's strategy. Spread the action out. Help waste the enemy's numbers. 
You and the other members of your group should already have a target or two in 
mind that will make for easy trashing. If you don't have one, setting fires in trash 
cans and ringing fire alarms will help provide a cover for other teams that do 
have objectives picked out. Putting out street lights with rocks also helps the 
general infusion. 
After a few tries at trashing, you'll begin to overcome your fears, learn what to 
expect from both the pigs and your comrades, and develop your own street 
strategy. Nothing works like practice in actual street conditions. Get your head 
together and you'll become a pro. Don't make the basic mistake of just naively 
floating into the area. Don't think "rally" or "demonstration," think "WAR" and 
"Battle Zone." Keep your eyes and ears open. Watch for mistakes made by 
members of your gang and those made by other comrades. Watch for blunders 
by the police. In street fighting, every soldier should think like a general. 
Workshops should be organized right after an action to discuss the strength and 
weaknesses of techniques and strategies used. Avoid political bullshit at such 
raps. Regard them as military sessions. Persons not versed in the tactics of 
revolution usually have nothing worthwhile to say about the politics of revolution. 
People's Chemistry 
STINK BOMB 
You can purchase buteric acid at any chemical supply store for "laboratory 
experiments." It can be thrown or poured directly in an area you think already 
stinks. A small bottle can be left uncapped behind a door that opens into the 
target room. When a person enters they will knock over the bottle, spilling the 
liquid. Called a "Froines," by those in the know, an ounce of buteric acid can go a 
long way. Be careful not to get it on your clothing. A home-made stink bomb can 
be made by mixing a batch of egg whites, Drano, (sodium hydroxide) and water. 
Let the mixture sit for a few days in a capped bottle before using. 
SMOKE BOMB 
Sometimes it becomes strategically correct to confuse the opposition and provide 
a smoke screen to aid an escape. A real home-made stroke bomb can be made 
by combining four parts sugar to six parts saltpeter (available at all chemical 
supply stores). This mixture must then be heated over a very low flame. It will 
blend into a plastic substance. When this starts to gel, remove from the heat and 
allow the plastic to cool. Embed a few wooden match heads into the mass while 
it's still pliable and attach a fuse.* 
The smoke bomb itself is a non-explosive and non-flame-producing, so no 
extreme safety requirements are needed. About a pound of the plastic will 
produce thick enough smoke to fill a city block. Just make sure you know which 
way the wind is blowing. Weathermen-women! If you're not the domestic type, 
you can order smoke flares (yellow or black) for $2.00 a flare [12 inch] from Time 
Square Stage Lighting Co., 318 West 47th Street, New York, NY 10036. 
*You can make a good homemade fuse by dipping a string in glue and then 
rolling it lightly in gunpowder. When the glue hardens, wrap the string tightly and 
neatly with scotch tape. This fuse can be used in a variety of ways. Weight it on 
one end and drop a rock into the tank of a pig vehicle. Light the other end and 
run like hell. 
CBW 
LACE (Lysergic Acid Crypto-Ethelene) can be made by mixing LSD with DMSO, 
a high penetrating agent, and water. Sprayed from an atomizer or squirted from a 
water pistol, the purple liquid will send any pig twirling into the Never-Never Land 
of chromosome damage. It produces an involuntary pelvic action in cops that 
resembles fucking. Remember when Mace runs out, turn to Lace. 
How about coating thin darts in LSD and shooting them from a Daisy Air Pellet 
Gun? Guns and darts are available at hobby and sports shops. Sharpening the 
otherwise dull darts will help in turning on your prey.

RUBBER BANDS* 
MOLOTOV COCKTAIL 
Molotov cocktails are a classic street fighting weapon served up around the 
world. If you've never made one, you should try it the next time you are in some 
out-of-the-way barren place just to wipe the fear out of your mind and know that it 
works. Fill a thin-walled bottle half full with gasoline. Break up a section of 
styrofoam (cups made of this substance work fine) and let it sit in the gasoline for 
a few days. The mixture should be slushy and almost fill the bottle. The 
styrofoam spreads the flames around and regulates the burning. The mixture has 
nearly the same properties as napalm. Soap flakes (not detergents) can be 
substituted for styrofoam. Rubber cement and sterno also work. In a pinch, plain 
gasoline will do nicely, but it burns very fast. A gasoline-kerosene mixture is 
preferred by some folks. 
Throwing, although by far not the safest method, is sometimes necessary. The 
classic technique of stuffing a rag in the neck of a bottle, lighting and tossing is 
foolish. Often gas fumes escape from the bottle and the mixture ignites too soon, 
endangering the thrower. If you're into throwing, the following is a much safer 
method: Once the mixture is prepared and inside the bottle, cap it tightly using 
the original cap or a suitable cork. Then wash the bottle off with rubbing alcohol 
and wipe it clean. Just before you leave to strike a target, take a strip of rag or a 
tampax and dip it in gasoline. Wrap this fuse in a small plastic baggie and attach 
the whole thing to the neck of the capped bottle with the aid of several rubber 
bands. When you are ready to toss, use a lighter to ignite the baggie. Pall back 
your arm and fling it as soon as the tampax catches fire. This is a very safe 
method if followed to the letter. The bottle must break to ignite. Be sure to throw it 
with some force against a hard surface. 
Naturally, an even safer method is to place the firebomb in a stationary position 
and rig up a timing fuse. Cap tightly and wipe with alcohol as before. The alcohol 
wipe not only is a safety factor, but it eliminates tell-tale fingerprints in case the 
Molotov doesn't ignite. Next, attach an ashcan fire cracker (M-80) or a cherry 
bomb to the side of the bottle using epoxy glue. A fancier way is to punch a hole 
in the cap and pull the fuse of the cherry bomb up through the hole before you 
seal the bottle. A dab of epoxy will hold the fuse in place and insure the seal. A 
firecracker fuse ignites quickly so something will have to be rigged that will deal 
the action enough to make a clean getaway. 
When the firebomb is placed where you want it, light up a non-filter cancerette. 
Take a few puffs (being sure not to inhale the vile fumes) to get it going and work 
the unlighted end over the fuse of the firecracker. This will provide a delay of 
from 5 to 15 minutes. To use this type of fuse successfully, there must be enough 
air in the vicinity so the flame won't go out. A strong wind would not be good 
either. When the cancerette burns down, it sets off the firecracker which in turn 
explodes and ignites the mixture. The flames shoot out in the direction opposite 
to where you attach the firecracker, thus allowing you to aim the firebomb at the 
most flammable material. With the firecracker in the cap, the flames spread 
downward in a halo. The cancerette fuse can also be used with a book of 
matches to ignite a pool of gasoline or a trash can. Stick the unlighted end 
behind the row of match heads and close the cover. A firecracker attached to a 
gallon jug of red paint and set off can turn an office into total abstract art. 
Commercial fuses are available in many hobby stores. Dynamite fuses are 
excellent and sold in most rural hardware stores. A good way to make a 
homemade fuse is described above under the Smoke Bomb section. By adding 
an extra few feet of fuse to the device and then attaching the lit cancerette fuse, 
you add an extra measure of caution. It is most important to test every type of 
fuse device you plan to use a number of times before the actual hit. Some 
experimentation will allow you to standardize the results. If you really want to get 
the job done right and have the time, place several molotov cocktails in a group 
and rig two with fuses (in case one goes out). When one goes, they all go . .

STERNO BOMB 
One of the simplest bombs to make is the converted sterno can. It will provide 
some bang and a widely dispersed spray of jellied fire. Remove the lid from a 
standard, commercially purchased can and punch a hold in the center big 
enough for the firecracker fuse. Take a large spoonful of jelly out of the center to 
make room for the firecracker. Insert the firecracker and pull the fuse up through 
the hole in the lid. When in place, cement around the hole with epoxy glue. Put 
some more glue around the rim of the can and reseal the lid. Wipe the can and 
wash off excess with rubbing alcohol. A cancerette fuse should be used. The can 
could also be taped around a bottle with Molotov mixture and ignited.

AEROSOL BOMB 
You can purchase smokeless gunpowder at most stores where guns and 
ammunition are sold. It is used for reloading bullets. The back of shotgun shells 
can be opened and the powder removed. Black powder is more highly explosive 
but more difficult to come by. A graduate chemist can make or get all you'll need. 
If you know one that can be trusted, go over a lot of shit with him. Try turning him 
on to learning how to make "plastics" which are absolutely the grooviest 
explosive available. The ideal urban guerrilla weapons are these explosive 
plastic compounds. 
The neat homemade bomb that really packs a wallop can be made from a 
regular aerosol can that is empty. Remove the nozzle and punch in the nipple 
area on the top of the can. Wash the can out with rubbing alcohol and let dry. Fill 
it gently and lovingly with an explosive powder. Add a layer of cotton to the top 
and insert a cherry bomb fuse. Use epoxy glue to hold the fuse in place and seal 
the can. The can should be wiped clean with rubbing alcohol. Another safety hint 
to remember is never store the powder and your fuses or other ignition material 
together. Powder should always be treated with a healthy amount of respect. No 
smoking should go on in the assembling area and no striking of hard metals that 
might produce a spark. Use your head and you'll get to keep it. 
PIPE BOMBS 
Perhaps the most widely used homemade concussion bombs are those made 
out of pipe. Perfected by George Metesky, the renown New York Mad Bomber, 
they are deadly, safe, easy to assemble, and small enough to transport in your 
pocket. You want a standard steel pipe (two inches in diameter is a good size) 
that is threaded on both ends so you can cap it. The length you use depends on 
how big an explosion is desired. Sizes between 3-10 inches in length have been 
successfully employed. Make sure both caps screw on tightly before you insert 
the powder. The basic idea to remember is that a bomb is simply a hot fire 
burning very rapidly in a tightly confined space. The rapidly expanding gases 
burst against the walls of the bomb. If they are trapped in a tightly sealed iron 
pipe, when they finally break out, they do so with incredible force. If the bomb 
itself is placed in a somewhat enclosed area like a ventilation shaft, doorway or 
alleyway, it will in turn convert this larger area into a "bomb" and increase the 
over-all explosion immensely.

When you have the right pipe and both caps selected, drill a hole in the side of 
the pipe (before powder is inserted) big enough to pull the fuse through. If you 
are using a firecracker fuse, insert the firecracker, pull the fuse through and 
epoxy it into place securely. If you are using long fusing either with a detonator 
(difficult to come by) timing device or a simple cancerette fuse, drill two holes and 
run two lines of fuse into the pipe. When you have the fuse rigged to the pipe, 
you are ready to add the powder. Cape one end snugly, making sure you haven't 
trapped any grains of powder in the threads. Wipe the device with rubbing 
alcohol and you're ready to blast off. 
A good innovation is to grind down one half of the pipe before you insert the 
powder. This makes the walls of one end thinner than the walls of the other end. 
When you place the bomb, the explosion, following the line of least resistance, 
will head in that direction. You can do this with ordinary grinding tools available in 
any hardware or machine shop. Be sure not to have the powder around when 
you are grinding the pipe, since sparks are produced. Woodstock Nation contains 
instructions for more pipe bombs and a neat timing device (see pages 115-117). 
GENERAL BOMB STRATEGY 
This section is not meant to be a handbook on explosives. Anyone who wishes to 
become an expert in the field can procure a number of excellent books on the 
subject catalogued in the Appendix. In bombing, as in trashing, the same general 
strategy in regard to the selection of targets applies. Never use anti-personnel 
shrapnel bombs. Always be careful in placing the devices to keep them away 
from glass windows and as far away from the front of the building as possible. 
Direct them away from any area in which there might be people. Sophisticated 
electric timers should be used only by experts in demolitions. Operate in the wee 
hours of the night and be careful that you don't injure a night watchman or guard. 
Telephone in warnings before the bomb goes off. The police record all calls to 
emergency numbers and occasionally people have been traced down by the use 
of a voice-o-graph. The best way to avoid detection is by placing a huge wad of 
chewed up gum on the roof of your mouth before you talk. Using a cloth over the 
phone is not good enough to avoid detection. Be as brief as possible and always 
use a pay phone. 
When you get books from companies or libraries dealing with explosives or 
guerrilla warfare, use a phony name and address. Always do this if you obtain 
chemicals from a chemical supply house. These places are being increasingly 
watched by the F.B.I. Store your material and literature in a safe cool place and 
above all, keep your big mouth shut! 
Now if the head is bleeding, do you tighten a tourni- 
quet around the neck? 
First Aid For Street Fighters 
Without intending to spook you, we think it is becoming increasingly important for 
as many people as possible to develop basic first aid skills. As revolutionary 
struggle intensifies, so will the number and severity of injuries increase. Reliance 
on establishment medical facilities will become risky. Hospitals that border on 
"riot" areas are used by police to apprehend suspects. All violence-induced 
injuries treated by establishment doctors might be reported. Knife and gunshot 
wounds in all states by law must be immediately phoned in for investigation. At 
times a victim has no choice but to run such risks. If you can, use a phony name, 
but everyone should know the location of sympathetic doctors. 
Chaos resulting from the gassing, clubbing and shooting associated with a police 
riot also makes personal first aid important. Most demonstrations have medical 
teams that run with the people and staff mobile units, but often these become the 
target of assault by the more vicious pigs. Also, in the confusion, there is usually 
too much work for the medical teams. Everyone must take responsibility for 
everyone else if we are to survive in the streets. If you spot someone lying 
unconscious or badly injured, take it upon yourself to help the victim. Immediately 
raise your arm or wave your Nation flag and shout for a medic. If the person is 
badly hurt, it is best not to move him, or her, but if there is the risk of more harm 
or the area is badly gassed, the victim should be moved to safety. Try to be as 
gentle as possible. Get some people to help you. 
WHAT TO DO 
Your attitude in dealing with an injured person is extremely important. Don't panic 
at the sight of blood. Most bloody injuries look far worse than they are. Don't get 
nervous if the victim is unconscious. If you're not able to control your own fear 
about treating someone, call for another person. It helps to attend a few first aid 
classes to overcome these fears in practice sessions. 
When you approach the victim, identify yourself. Calmly, but quickly figure out 
what's the matter. Check to see if the person is alive by feeling for the pulse. 
There are a number of spots to check if the blood is circulating, under the chin 
near the neck, the wrists, and ankles are the most common. Get in the habit of 
feeling a normal pulse. A high pulse (over 100 per minute) usually indicates 
shock. A low pulse indicates some kind of injury to the heart or nervous system. 
Massaging the heart can often restore the heartbeat, especially if its loss is due 
to a severe blow to the chest. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should be used if the 
victim is not breathing. Both these skills can be mastered in a first aid course in 
less than an hour and should become second nature to every street fighter. 
When it comes to dealing with bleeding or possible fractures, enlisting the 
victim's help as well as adopting a firm but calm manner will be very reassuring. 
This is important to avoid shock. Shock occurs when there is a serious loss of 
blood and not enough is being supplied to the brain. The symptoms are high 
pulse rate; cold, clammy, pale skin; trembling or unconsciousness. Try to keep 
the patient warm with blankets or coats. If a tremendous amount of blood has 
been lost, the victim may need a transfusion. Routine bleeding can be stopped 
by firm direct pressure over the source of bleeding for 5 to 10 minutes. If an 
artery has been cut and bleeding is severe, a tourniquet will be needed. Use a 
belt, scarf or torn shirtsleeve. Tie the tourniquet around the arm or leg directly 
above the bleeding area and tighten it until the bleeding stops. Do not loosen the 
tourniquet. Wrap the injured limb in a cold wet towel or ice if available and move 
the person to a doctor or hospital before irreparable damage can occur. Don't 
panic, though, you have about six hours. 
A painful blow to a limb is best treated with an ice pack and elevation of the 
extremity by resting it on a pillow or rolled-up jacket. A severe blow to the chest 
or side can result in a rib fracture which produces sharp pains when breathing 
and/or coughing up blood. Chest X-rays will eventually be needed. Other internal 
injuries can occur from sharp body blows such as kidney injuries. They are 
usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, shock and persistent abdominal pain. 
If you feel a bad internal injury has occurred, get prompt professional help. 
Head injuries have to be attended to with more attention than other parts of the 
body. Treat them by stopping the bleeding with direct pressure. They should be 
treated before other injuries as they more quickly can cause shock. Every head 
injury should be X-rayed and the injured person should be watched for the next 
24 hours as complications can develop hours after the injury was sustained. After 
a severe blow to the head, be on the look-out for excessive sleepiness or 
difficulty in waking. Sharp and persistent headaches, vomiting and nausea, 
dizziness or difficulty maintaining balance are all warning signs. If they occur 
after a head injury, call a doctor. 
If a limb appears to be broken or fractured, improvise a splint before moving the 
victim. Place a stiff backing behind the limb such as a board or rolled-up 
magazine and wrap both with a bandage. Try to avoid moving the injured limb as 
this can lead to complicating the fracture. Every fracture must be X-rayed to 
evaluate the extent of the injury and subsequent treatment. 
Bullet wounds to the abdomen, chest or head, if loss of consciousness occurs 
are extremely dangerous and must be seen by a doctor immediately. If the 
wound occurs in the limb, treat as you would any bleeding with direct pressure 
bandage and tourniquet only if nothing else will stop the bleeding. 
If you expect trouble, every person going to a street scene should have a few 
minimum supplies in addition to those mentioned in the section on 
Demonstrations for protection. A handful of bandaids, gauze pads (4x4), an ace 
bandage (3 inch width), and a roll of 1/2 inch adhesive tape can all easily fit in 
your pocket. A plastic bag with cotton balls pre-soaked in water will come in 
handy in a variety of situations where gas is being used, as will a small bottle of 
mineral oil. You should write the name, phone number and address of the 
nearest movement doctor on your arm with a ballpoint pen. Your arm's getting 
pretty crowded, isn't it? If someone is severely injured, it may be better to save 
their life by taking them to a hospital, even though that means probable capture 
for them, rather than try to treat it yourself. However, do not confuse the police 
with the hospital. Many injured people have been finished off by the porkers, and 
that's no joke. It is usually better to treat a person yourself rather than let the pigs 
get them, unless they have ambulance equipment right there and don't seem 
vicious. Even then, they will often wait until they get two or three victims before 
making a trip to the hospital. 
If you have a special medical problem, such as being a diabetic or having a 
penicillin allergy, you should wear a medi-alert tag around your neck indicating 
your condition. Every person who sees a lot of street action should have a 
tetanus shot at least once in every five years. 
Know just this much, and it will help to keep down serious injuries at 
demonstrations. A few lessons in a first aid class at one of the Free Universities 
or People's Clinics will go a long way in providing you with the confidence and 
skill needed in the street.

Hip-Pocket Law 
LEGAL ADVICE 
Any discussion about what to do while waiting fur the lawyer has to be qualified 
by pointing out that from the moment of arrest through the court appearances, 
cops tend to disregard a defendant's rights. Nonetheless, you should play it 
according to the book whenever possible as you might get your case bounced 
out on a technicality. When you get busted, rule number one is that you have the 
right to remain silent. We advise that you give only your name and address. 
There is a legal dispute about whether or not you are obligated under the law to 
do even that, but most lawyers feel you should. The address can be that of a 
friend if you're uptight about the pigs knowing where you live. 
When the pigs grab you, chances are they are going to insult you, rough you up 
a little and maybe even try to plant some evidence on you. Try to keep your cool. 
Any struggle on your part, even lying on the street limp, can be considered 
resisting arrest. Even if you beat the original charge, you can be found guilty of 
resisting and receive a prison sentence. Often if the pigs beat you, they will say 
that you attacked them and generally charge you with assault. 
If you are stopped in the street on suspicion (which means you're black or have 
long hair), the police have the right to pat you down to see if you are carrying a 
weapon. They cannot search you unless they place you under arrest. 
Technically, this can only be done in the police station where they have the right 
to examine your possessions. Thus, if you are in a potential arrest situation, you 
should refrain from carrying dope, sharp objects that can be classified as a 
weapon, and the names and phone numbers of people close to you, like your 
dealer, your local bomb factory, and your friends underground. 
Forget about talking your way out of it or escaping once you're in the car or 
paddy wagon. In the police station, insist on being allowed to call your lawyer. 
Getting change might be a problem so you should always have a few dimes 
hidden. Since many cases are dismissed because of this, you'll generally be 
allowed to make some calls, but it might take a few hours. Call a close friend and 
tell him to get all the cash that can be quickly raised and head down to the court 
house. Usually the police will let you know where you'll be taken. If they don't, 
just tell your friend what precinct you're being held at, and he can call the central 
police headquarters and find out what court you'll be appearing in. Ask your 
friend to also call a lawyer which you also should do if you get another phone 
call. Hang up and dial a lawyer or defense committee that has been set up for 
demonstrations. The lawyer will either come to the station or meet you in court 
depending on the severity of the charge and the likelihood you'll be beaten in the 
station. When massive demonstrations are occurring where a number of busts 
are anticipated, it's best to have lawyers placed in police stations in the 
immediate vicinity. 
The lawyer will want to know as many details as possible of the case so try and 
concentrate on remembering a number of things since the pigs aren't going to let 
you take notes. If you can, remember the name and badge number of the fink 
that busted you. Sometimes they'll switch arresting officers on you. Remember 
the time, location of the bust and any potential witnesses that the lawyer might be 
able to contact. 
If you are unable to locate a lawyer, don't panic, the court will assign you one at 
the time of the arraignment. Legal Aid lawyers are free and can usually do as 
good a job as a private lawyer at an arraignment. Often they can do better, as the 
judge might set a lower bail if he sees you can't afford a private lawyer. The 
arraignment is probably the first place you'll find out what the charges are against 
you. There will also be a court date set and bail established. The amount of bail 
depends on a variety of factors ranging from previous convictions to the judge's 
hangover. It can be put up in collateral, i.e., a bank book, or often there is a cash 
alternative offered which amounts to about 10% of the total bail. 
Your friend should be in the court with some cash (at least a hundred dollars is 
recommended). For very high bail, there are the bail bondsmen in the area of the 
courthouse who will cover the bail for a fee, generally not to exceed 5%. You will 
need some signatures of solid citizens to sign the bail papers and perhaps put up 
some collateral. 
Once you get bailed out, you should contact a private lawyer, preferably one that 
has experience with your type of case. If you are low on bread, check out one of 
the community or movement legal groups in your area. It is not advisable to keep 
the legal aid lawyer beyond the arraignment if at all possible. 
If you're in a car or in your home, the police do not have a right to search the 
premises without a search warrant or probable cause. Do not consent to any 
search without a warrant, especially if there are witnesses around who can hear 
you. Without your consent, the pigs must prove probable cause in the court. It's 
unbelievable the number of defendants that not only come naked, but pull their 
own pants down. Make the cops kick in the door or break open the trunk 
themselves. You are under no obligation to assist them in collecting evidence, 
and helping them weakens your case.

JOIN THE ARMY OF YOUR CHOICE 
The first rule of our new Nation prohibits any of us from serving in the army of a 
foreign power with which we do not have an alliance. Since we exist in a state of 
war with the Pig Empire, we all have a responsibility to beat the draft by any 
means necessary. 
First check out your medical history. Review every chronic or long-term illness 
you ever had. Be sure to put down all the serious infections like mono or hep. 
Next, make note of your physical complications. When you have assembled a 
complete list, get a copy of Physical Deferments or one of the other draft 
counseling manuals and see if you qualify. If you have a legitimate deferment, 
document it with a letter from a doctor. 
The next best deal is a Conscientious Objection status (CO.) or a psychiatric 
deferment (psycho). The laws have been getting progressively broader in 
defining CO. status during the past few year s. The most recent being, "sincere 
moral objections to war," without necessarily a belief in a supreme being. There 
are general guidelines sent out by the National Office of Selective Service that 
say it is a matter of conscience. The decision, however, is still pretty much in the 
hands of the local board. Visit a Draft Counseling Center if you feel you have a 
chance for this type of story. They'll know how your local board tends to rule. 
There are still some more cases to be heard by the Supreme Court before 
objection to a particular war is allowed or disallowed. It is not grounds for 
deferment as of now. 
Psychos are our specialty. Chromosome damage has totally wiped out our minds 
when it comes to concentrating on killing innocent people in Asia. When you get 
your invite to join the army, there are lots of ways you can prepare yourself 
mentally. Begin by staggering up to a cop and telling him you don't know who you 
are or where you live. He'll arrange for you to be chauffeured to the nearest 
mental hospital. There you repeat your performance, dropping the clue that you 
have used LSD in the past, but you aren't sure if you're on it now or not. In due 
time, they'll put you up for the night. When morning comes, you bounce out of 
bed, remember who you are, swear you'll never drop acid again and thank 
everyone who took care of you. Within a few hours, you'll be discharged. Don't 
be uptight about thinking how they'll lock you up forever cause you really are 
nuts. The hospitals measure victories by how quickly they can throw you out the 
door. They are all overcrowded anyway. 
In most areas, a one-night stand in a mental hospital is enough to convince the 
shrink at the induction center that you're capable of eating the flesh of a colonel. 
Just before you go, see a sympathetic psychiatrist and explain your sad mental 
shape. He'll get verification that you did time in a hospital and include it in his 
letter, that you'll take along to the induction center. 
When you get to the physical examination, a high point in any young man's life, 
there are lots of things working in your favor. Here, long hair helps; the army 
doesn't want to bother with trouble-makers. Remember this even though a tough 
looking sergeant runs down bullshit about "how they're gonna fix your ass" and 
"anybody with a trigger finger gets passed." He's just auditioning for the Audie 
Murphy movies, so don't believe anything he lays down. 
Talk to the other guys about how rotten the war in Vietnam is and how if you get 
forced to go, you'll end up shooting some officers. Tell them you'd like the 
training so you can come back and take up with the Weathermen. 
Check off as many items as can't be verified when given the forms. Suicide, dizzy 
spells, bed-wetting, dope addiction, homosexuality, hepatitis. Be able to drop a 
few symptoms on the psychiatrist to back up your story of rejection by a cold and 
brutal society that was indifferent, from a domineering father that beat you, and 
mother that didn't understand anything. Be able to trace your history of bad family 
relationships, your taking to the streets at 15 and eventually your getting 
"hooked." Let him "pry" things out of you if possible. Show him your letter if you 
had the foresight to get one. 
Practice a good story before you go for the physical with someone who has 
already beat the system. If your local board is fucked up, you can transfer to an 
area that disqualifies almost everyone who wants out, such as the New York City 
boards. If you can't think of anything you can always get FUCK ARMY tattooed 
on the outside of the baby finger of your right hand and give the tough sergeant a 
snappy salute and a hearty "yes sir!"* 
*lf unfortunately you get hauled in. The Army gives you a life insurance policy. By 
making Dan Berrigan or Angela Davis the beneficiary you might avoid front-line 
duty. 
CANADA, SWEDEN & POLITICAL ASYLUM 
If you've totally fucked up your chances of getting a deferment or already are in 
the service and considering ditching, there are some things that you should know 
about asylum. 
There are three categories of countries that you should be interested in if you are 
planning to ship out to avoid the draft or a serious prison term. The safest 
countries are those with which Amerika has mutual offense treaties such as 
Cuba, North Korea and those behind the so-called Iron Curtain. The next safest 
are countries unfriendly to the U.S. but suffer the possibility of a military coup 
which might radically affect your status. Cambodia is a recent example of a 
border-line country. Some cats hijacked a ship bound for Vietnam and went to 
Cambodia where they were granted asylum. Shortly thereafter the military with a 
good deal of help from the CIA, took over and now the cats are in jail. Algeria is 
currently a popular sanctuary in this category. 
Sweden will provide political asylum for draft dodgers and deserters. It helps to 
have a passport, but even that isn't necessary since they are required by their 
own laws to let you in. There are now about 35,000 exiles from the Pig Empire 
living in Sweden. The American Deserters Committee, Upplandsgaten 18, 
Stockholm, phone 08-344663, will provide you with immediate help, contacts and 
procedural information once you get there. If you enter as a tourist with a 
passport, you can just go to the local police station, state you are seeking asylum 
and fill out a form. It's that sample. They stamp your passport and this allows you 
to hustle rent and food from the Swedish Social Bureau. It takes six months for 
you to get working papers that will permit you to get employment, but you can 
live on welfare until then with no hassle. The following places can be contacted, 
for additional help. They are all in Stockholm: 
. Reverend Tom Hayes 82-42-1 1 or 21-45-86 
. Kristina Nystrom of the Social Bureau 08-230570 
. Bengt Suderstrom 31-84-32 (legal) 
. Hans-Goran Franck 10-25-02(legal) 
Canada does not offer political asylum but they do not support the U.S. foreign 
policy in Southeast Asia so they allow draft dodgers and deserters to the current 
tune of 50,000 to live there unmolested. Do not tell the officials at the border that 
you are a deserter or draft dodger, as they will turn you in. Pose as a visitor. To 
work in Canada you have to qualify for landed immigration status under a point 
system. 
There will be a number of background questions asked and you have to score 50 
points or better to pass and qualify. You get one point for each year of formal 
education, 10 points if you have a professional skill, 10 points for being between 
18-35 years of age, more points for having a Canadian home and job waiting for 
you, for knowing English or French and a whopping 15 points for having a 
stereotyped middle class appearance and life-style. Letters from a priest or rabbi 
will help here. Some entry points are easier than others. Kingsgate, for example, 
just north of Montana is very good on weekdays after 10:00 P.M. 
The best approach if you are considering going to Canada is to write or, better 
still, visit the Montreal Council to Aid War Resisters, Case Postale 5, Westmount, 
Montreal, 215 Quebec or American Deserters Committee, 3837 Blvd., Saint 
Laurent, St. Louis, Montreal 3, Quebec. They will provide you with the latest info 
on procedures and the problems of living in Canada as a war resister. If you can't 
make it up there, see a local anti-war organization for counseling. If you are 
already in the army, you should find out all you need to know before you ditch. 
It's best to cross the border while you're on leave as it might mean the difference 
between going AWOL and desertion if you decide to come back. In any event, no 
one should renounce their citizenship until they have qualified for landed 
immigration status as that would classify the person as a non-resident and make 
it possible for the Canadian police to send you back, which on a few rare 
occasions has happened. 
Because there have been few cases of fugitives from the U.S. seeking political 
asylum, there is not a clear and ample formula that can be stated. Germany, 
France, Belgium and Sweden will often offer asylum for obvious political cases 
but each case must be considered individually. Go there incognito. Contact a 
movement organization or lawyer and have them make application to the 
government. Usually they will let you stay if you promise not to engage in political 
organizing in their country. In any event if they deport you these countries are 
good enough to let you pick the country to which you desire to be sent. 
We feel it's our obligation to let people know that life in exile is not all a neat deal, 
not by a long shot. You are removed from the struggle here at home, the 
problems of finding work are immense and the customs of the people are strange 
to you. Most people are unhappy in exile. Many return, some turn themselves in 
and others come back to join the growing radical underground making war in the 
belly of the great white whale. 
Steal Now, Pay Never 
SHOPLIFTING 
This section presents some general guidelines on thievery to put you ahead of 
the impulse swiping. With some planning ahead, practice and a little nerve, you 
can pick up on some terrific bargains. 
Being a successful shoplifter requires the development of an outlaw mentality. 
When you enter a store you should already have cased the joint so don't browse 
around examining all sorts of items, staring over your shoulder and generally 
appearing like you're about to snatch something and are afraid of getting caught. 
Enter, having a good idea of what you want and where it's located. 
Camouflage is important. Be sure you dress the part by looking like an average 
customer. If you are going to rip-off expensive stores (why settle for less), act like 
you have a chauffeur driven car double parked around the corner. A good rule is 
dress in the style and price range of the clothes, etc., you are about to shoplift. 
The reason we recommend the more expensive stores is that they tend to have 
less security guards, relying instead on mechanical methods or more usually on 
just the sales people. Many salespeople are uptight about carrying out a bust if 
they catch you. A large number are thieves themselves, in fact one good way to 
steal is simply explain to the salesclerk that you're broke and ask if you can take 
something without paying. It's a great way to radicalize shop personnel by 
rapping to them about why they shouldn't give a shit if the boss gets ripped off. 
The best time to work out is on a rainy, cold day during a busy shopping season. 
Christmas holiday is a shoplifter's paradise. In these periods you can wear heavy 
overcoats or loose raincoats without attracting suspicion. The crowds of 
shoppers will keep the nosy "can-l-help-you's" from fucking up your style. 
Since you have already checked out the store before hitting it, you'll know the 
store's "blind-spots" where you can be busy without being observed too easily. 
Dressing rooms, blind alley aisles and washrooms are some good spots. Know 
where the cashier's counter is located, where the exits to the street and storage 
rooms are to be found, and most important, the type of security system in use. 
If you are going to snatch in the dressing room, be sure to carry more than one 
item in with you. Don't leave tell-tale empty hangers behind. Take them out and 
ditch them in the aisles. 
An increasingly popular method of security is a small shoplifting plastic detector 
attached to the price tag. It says "Do Not Remove" and if you do, it electronically 
triggers an alarm in the store. If you try to make it out the door, it also trips the 
alarm system. When a customer buys the item, the cashier removes the detector 
with a special deactivation machine. When you enter the store, notice if the door 
is rigged with electronic eyes. They are often at the waist level, which means if 
the item is strapped to your calf or tucked under your hat, you can walk out 
without a peep from the alarm. If you trigger the alarm either inside the store or at 
the threshold, just dash off lickety-split. The electronic eyes are often disguised 
as part of the decor. By checking to see what the cashier does with merchandise 
bought, you can be sure if the store is rigged. Other methods are undercover 
pigs that look like shoppers, one-way mirrors and remote control television 
cameras. Undercover pigs are expensive so stores are usually understaffed. Just 
watch out (without appearing to watch out) that no one observes you in action. 
As to mirrors and cameras there are always blind spots in a store created when 
displays are moved around, counters shifted, and boxes piled in the aisles. 
Mirrors and cameras are rarely adjusted to fit these changes. Don't get turned off 
by this security jazz. The percentage of stores that have sophisticated security 
systems such as those described is very small. If you work out at lunch time, the 
security guards and many of the sales personnel will be out of the store. Just 
before closing is also good, because the clerks are concentrating on going home. 
By taking only one or two items, you can prevent a bust if caught by just acting 
like a dizzy klepto socialite getting kicks or use the "Oh-gee-l-forgot-to-pay" 
routine. Stores don't want to hassle going into court to press charges, so they 
usually let you go after you return the stuff. If you thought ahead, you'll have 
some cash ready to pay for the items you've pocketed, if caught. Leave your I.D. 
and phone book at home before going shopping. People rarely go to jail for 
shoplifting, most if caught never even see a real cop. Just lie like a fucker and the 
most you'll get is a lecture on law and order and a warning not to come back to 
that store or else. 
TECHNIQUES 
The lining of a bulky overcoat or loose raincoat can be elaborately outfitted with a 
variety of custom-made large pockets. The openings to these pockets are not 
visible since they are inside the coat. The outside pockets can be torn out leaving 
only the opening or slit. Thus you can reach your hand (at counter level) through 
the slit in your coat and drop objects into the secret pockets sewn into the lining. 
Pants can also be rigged with secret pockets. The idea is to let your fingers do 
the walking through the slit in your coat, while the rest of the body remains the 
casual browser. You'll be amazed at how much you can tuck away without any 
noticeable bulge. 
Another method is to use a hidden belt attached to the inside of your coat or 
pants. The belt is specially designed with hooks or clothespins to which items 
can be discretely attached. Ditching items into hidden pockets requires a little 
cunning. You should practice before a mirror until you get good at it. 
A good idea is to work with a partner. Dig this neat duet. A man and woman walk 
into a store together looking like a respectable husband and wife. The man 
purchases a good belt or shirt and engages the salesman in some distracting 
conversation as he rings up the sale. Meanwhile, back in the aisle, "wife" is busy 
rolling up two or three suits. Start from the bottom while they are still on the rack 
and roll them up, pants and jackets together, the way you would roll a sleeping 
bag. The sleeves are tied around the roll making a neat little bundle. The bundle 
is then tucked between your thighs. The whole operation takes about a minute 
and with some practice you can walk for hours with a good size bundle between 
your legs and not appear like you just shit in your pants. Try this with a coat on in 
front of a mirror and see how good you get at it. 
Another team method is for one or more partners to distract the sales clerks 
while the other stuffs. There are all sorts of theater skits possible. One person 
can act drunk or better still appear to be having an epileptic fit. Two people can 
start a fight with each other. There are loads of ways, just remember how they do 
it in the next spy movie you see. 
One of the best gimmicks around is the packaging technique. Once you have the 
target item in hand, head for the fitting room or other secluded spot. Take out a 
large piece of gift wrapping and ribbon. Quickly wrap up the item so it will look 
like you brought it in with you. Many stores have their own bags and staple the 
cash register receipt to the top of the bag when you make a purchase. Get a 
number of these bags by saving them if you make a purchase or dropping 
around to the receiving department with a request for some bags for your 
Christmas play or something. Next collect some sales receipts, usually from the 
sidewalk or trash cans in front of the store. Buy or rip-off a small pocket stapler 
for less than a dollar. When you get the item you want, drop it in the bag and 
staple it closed, remembering to attach the receipt. This is an absolutely perfect 
method and takes just a few seconds. It eliminates a lot of unsightly bulges in 
your coat and is good for warm-weather heisting. 
A dummy shopping bag can be rigged with a bit of ingenuity. The idea is to make 
it look like the bag is full when there's still lots of room left. Use strips of 
cardboard taped to the inside of the bag to give it some body. Remember to carry 
it like it's filled with items, not air. Professional heisters often use a "booster box," 
usually a neatly wrapped empty package with one end that opens upon touch. 
This is ideal for electrical appliances, jewelry, and even heavy items such as 
portable television sets. The trick side can be fitted with a spring door so once 
the toaster is inside the door slams shut. Don't wear a black hat and cape and go 
around waving a wand yelling "Abracadabra," just be your usual shlep shopper 
self. If you can manage it, the trick side just can be an opening without a trick 
door. Just carry the booster box with the open side pressed against your body. 
Briefcases, suitcases and other types of carrying devices can all be made to hold 
items. Once you have something neatly tucked away in a bag or box, it's pretty 
hard to prove you didn't come in with it. 
ON THE JOB 
By far the easiest and most productive method of stealing is on the job. Wages 
paid to delivery boys, sales clerks, shippers, cashiers and the like are so insulting 
that stealing really is a way of maintaining self-respect. If you are set on stealing 
the store dry when you apply for the job, begin with your best foot forward. Make 
what employment agencies call a "good appearance." Exude cleanliness, 
Godliness, sobriety and all the other WASPy virtues third grade teachers insist 
upon. Building up a good front will eliminate suspicion when things are "missing." 
Mail clerks and delivery boys can work all sorts of neat tricks. When things get a 
little slow, type up some labels addressed to yourself or to close friends and play 
Santa Claus. Wrap yourself a few packages or take one that is supposed to go to 
a customer and put your label over theirs. Blame it on the post office or on the 
fact that "things get messed up 'cause of all the bureaucracy." It's great to be the 
one to verbalize the boss's own general feelings before he does when something 
goes awry. The best on-the-job crooks always end up getting promoted. 
Cashiers and sales persons who have access to money can pick up a little 
pocket change without too much effort, no matter how closely they are watched 
by supervisors. Women can make use of torn hems to stash coins and bills. Men 
can utilize cuffs. Both can use shoes and don't forget those secret little pockets 
you learned about in the last section. If you ring up items on a cash register, you 
can easily mistake $1 .39 for 390 or $1 .98 for 980 during the course of a hectic 
day. Leave pennies on the top shelf of the cash register and move one to the far 
right side every time you skip a dollar. That way at the end of the day, you'll know 
how much to pocket and won't have to constantly be stuffing, stuffing, stuffing. 
If you pick up trash or clean up, you can stick all sorts of items into wastebaskets 
and later sneak them out of the store. 
There are many ways of working heists with partners who pose as customers. 
See the sections on free food and clothing for these. There are also ways of 
working partnerships on the job. A cashier at a movie theater and a doorman can 
work out a system where the doorman collects the tickets and returns them to the 
cashier to sell again. 
A neat way to make a large haul is to get a job through an agency as a domestic 
for some rich slob. You should use a phony identification when you sign up at the 
agency. Once you are busy dusting the town house, check around for anything 
valuable to be taken home. Pick up the phone, order all sorts of merchandise, 
and have it delivered. A friend with a U-haul can help you really clean up. 
CREDIT CARDS 
Any discussion of shoplifting and forgeries inevitably leads to a rap on credit 
cards; those little shiny plastic wonder passes to fantasy land that are rendering 
cash obsolete. There are many ways to land a free credit card. You can get one 
yourself if your credit is good, or from a friend: report it stolen and go on a binge 
around town. Sign your name a little funny. Super underworld types might know 
where you can purchase a card that's not too hot on the black market. You might 
heist one at a fashionable party or restaurant. If you're a hat check girl at a night 
club, don't forget to check out pockets and handbags for plastic goodies.* 
Finally, you can redo a legitimate card with a new number and signature and be 
sure that it's on no one's "hot list." Begin by removing the ink on the raised letters 
with any polyester resin cleaner. Next, the plastic card should be held against a 
flat iron until the raised identification number is melted. You can use a razor 
blade to shave off rough spots. This combination of razor blade and hot iron, 
when worked skillfully, will produce a perfect blank card. When the card is 
smooth as new, reheat it using the flat iron and press an addressograph plate 
into the soft plastic. The ink can be replaced by matching the original at any 
stationary store. If this is too hard, you can buy machines to make your own 
credit cards, which are made for small department stores. Granted, this method 
is going require some expertise, but once you've learned to successfully forge a 
credit card, buy every item imaginable, eat fancy meals, and even get real money 
from a bank. 
*The absolute best method is to have an accomplice working in the post office rip 
off the new cards that are mailed out. They get to know quickly which envelopes 
contain new credit cards. Since the person never receives the card it never 
dawns on them to report it stolen. This gives you at least a solid month of 
carefree spending and your signature will be perfect. 
Whether your credit card is stolen, borrowed or forged, you still have to follow 
some guidelines to get away without any hassle. Know the store's checking 
method before you pass the hot card. Most stores have a fifty-dollar limit where 
they only call upstairs on items costing fifty dollars or more. In some stores it's 
less. Some places have a Regiscope system that takes your picture with each 
purchase. You should always carry at least one piece of back-up identification to 
use with the phony card as the clerk might get suspicious if you don't have any 
other ID. They can check out a "hot list" that the credit card companies send out 
monthly, so if you're uptight about anything watch the clerk's movements at all 
times. If things get tight, just split real quick. Often, even if a clerk or boss thinks 
it's a phony, they'll OK the sale anyway since the credit card companies make 
good to the stores on all purchases; legit or otherwise. Similarly, the insurance 
companies make good to the credit companies and so on until you get to a little 
group of hard working elves in the basement of the U.S. Mint who do nothing but 
print free money and lie to everybody about there being tons of gold at Fort Knox 
to back up their own little forging operation. 
Monkey Warfare 
If you like Halloween, you'll love monkey warfare. It's ideal for people uptight 
about guns, bombs and other children's toys, and allows for imaginative forms of 
protesting, many of which will become myth, hence duplicated and enlarged 
upon. A syringe (minus the needle) or a cooking baster can be filled with a dilute 
solution of epoxy glue. Get the two tubes in a hardware store and squeeze into a 
small bottle of rubbing alcohol. Shake real good and pour into the baster or 
syringe. You have about thirty minutes before the mixture gets too hard to use. 
Go after locks, parking meters, and telephones. You can fuck up the companies 
that use IBM cards by buying a cheap punch or using an Exacto knife and cutting 
an extra hole in the card before you return it with your payment. By the way, 
when you return payments always pay a few cents under or over. The company 
has to send you a credit or another bill and it screws up their bookkeeping 
system. Remember, always bend, fold, staple or otherwise mutilate the card. By 
the way if you ever find yourself in a computer room during a strike, you might 
want to fuck up the school records. You can do this by passing a large magnet or 
portable electro-magnet rapidly back and forth across the reels of tape, thus 
erasing them. And don't miss the tour of the IBM plant, either. 
Another good bit is to rent a safe deposit box (only about $7.00 a year) in a bank 
using a phony name. That usually only need a signature and don't ask for 
identification. When you get a box, deposit a good size dead fish inside the 
deposit box, close it up and return it to its proper niche. From then on, forget 
about it. Now think about it, in a few months there is going to be a hell-of-a-smell 
from your small investment. It's going to be almost impossible to trace and 
besides, they can never open the box without your permission. Since you don't 
exist, they'll have no alternative but to move away. Invest in the Stank of Amerika 
savings program. Just check out Lake Erie and you'll see saving fish isn't such a 
dumb idea. If you get caught, tell them you inherited the fish from your 
grandmother and it has sentimental value. 
There are lots of things you can send banks, draft boards and corporations that 
contribute to pollution via the mails. It is possible to also have things delivered. 
Have a hearse and flowers sent to the chief of police. We know someone who 
had a truckload of cement dumped in the driveway of her boss under the fib that 
the driveway was going to be repaved. 
By getting masses of people to use electricity, phones or water at a given time, 
you can fuck up some not-so-public utility. The whole problem is getting the word 
out. For example, 10,000 people turning on all their electrical appliances and 
lights in their homes at a given time can cause a blackout in any major city. A hot 
summer day at about 3:00 PM is best. Five thousand people calling up 
Washington, D.C. at 3:00 PM on a Friday (one of the busiest hours) ties up the 
major trunk lines and really puts a cramp in the government's style of carrying on. 
Call (202) 555-1212, which is information and you won't even have to pay for the 
call. If you call a government official, ask some questions like "How many kids did 
you kill today?" or "What kind of liquor do Congressmen drink?" or offer to take 
Teddy Kennedy for a ride. A woman can cause some real excitement by calling a 
Congressman's office and screaming "Tell that bastard he forgot to meet Irene at 
the motel this afternoon." 
A Washington call-in would work even better by phoning direct to homes of the 
big boys. For starters you can call collect the following*: 
• Richard M. Nixon - El Presidente - (202) 456-1444 
• Spiro T. Agnew - El Toro - (202) 265-2000 ext. 6400 
. John N. Mitchell - El Butcher - (202) 965-2900 
. Melvin R. Laird - El Defendo - (301 ) 652-4449 
. Henry A. Kissinger - El Exigente - (202) 337-0042 
. William P. Rogers - El Crapper - (301 ) 654-71 25 
. General Earl G. Wheeler - El Joint Bosso - (703) 527-61 1 9 
. General William C. Westmoreland - El Pollutoni - (703) 527-6999 
. Richard M. Helms - El Assassin - (301 ) 652-41 22

A great national campaign can be promoted that asks people to protest the 
presidential election farces on Inauguration Day. When a president says "So help 
me God," rush in and flush the toilet. A successful Flush for God campaign can 
really screw up the water system. 
If you want to give Ma Bell an electric permanent, consider this nasty. Cut the 
female device off an ordinary extension cord and expose the two wires. Unscrew 
the mouthpiece on the phone and remove the voice amplifier. You will see a red 
and a black wire attached to two terminals. Attach each of the wires from the 
extension cord to each one from the phone. Next plug in the extension cord to a 
wall socket. What you are doing is sending 120 volts of electricity back through 
equipment which is built for only volts. You can knock off thousands of phones, 
switchboards and devices if all goes right. It's best to do this on the phone in a 
large office building or university. You certainly will knock out their fuses. 
Unfortunately, at home your own phone will probably be knocked out of 
commission. If that happens, simply call up the business office and complain. 
They'll give you a new phone just the way they give the other seven million 
people that requested them that day. 
Remember, January is Alien Registration Month, so don't forget to fill out an 
application at the Post Office, listing yourself as a citizen of Free Nation. Then 
when they ask you to "Love it or leave it," tell them you already left! 
Okay General Mitchell, let f s see you dance 
Piece Now 
It's ridiculous to talk about a revolution without a few words on guns. If you 
haven't been in the army or done some hunting, you probably have a built-in fear 
against guns that can only be overcome by familiarizing yourself with them. 
There are two basic types of handguns or pistols; 
revolver and the automatic. The revolver carries a 
HANDGUNS 
There are two basic types of handguns or pistols: the revolver carries a load of 5 
or 6 bullets in a "revolving" chamber. The automatic usually holds the same 
number, but some can hold up to 14 bullets. Also, in the automatic the bullets 
can be already packed in a magazine which quickly snaps into position in the 
handle. The revolver must be reloaded one bullet at a time. An automatic can 
jam on rare occasions, or misfire, but with a revolver you just pull the trigger and 
there's a new bullet ready to fire. Despite pictures of Roy Rogers blasting a silver 
dollar out of the sky, handguns are difficult to master a high degree of accuracy 
with and are only good at short ranges. If you can hit a pig-size object at 25 
yards, you've been practicing. 
Among automatics, the Colt 45 is a popular model with a long record of reliability. 
A good popular favorite is a Parabellum 9 mm, which has the advantage of a 
double action on the first shot, meaning that the hammer does not have to be 
cocked, making possible a quick first shot without carrying a cocked gun around. 
By the way, do not bother with any handgun smaller than a .38 caliber, because 
cartridges smaller than that are too weak to be effective. 
Revolvers come in all sizes and makes, as do automatics. The most highly 
recommended are the .38 Special and the .357 Magnum. Almost all police forces 
use the .38 Special. They are light, accurate and the small-frame models are 
easy to conceal. If you get one, use high velocity hollow pointed bullets, such as 
the Speer DWM (146 grain h.p.) or the Super Vel (110 grain h.p.). The hollow 
point shatters on contact, insuring a kill to the not-so-straight shooters. Smith and 
Wesson makes the most popular .38 Special. The Charter Arms is a favorite 
model. The .357 Magnum is an extremely powerful handgun. You can shoot right 
through the wall of a thick door with one at a distance of 20 yards. It has its own 
ammo, but can also use the bullets designed for the .38. Both guns are about the 
same in price, running from $75-$100 new. An automatic generally runs about 
$25 higher. 
RIFLES 
There are two commonly available types of rifles; the bolt action and the semi- 
automatic. War surplus bolt action rifles are cheap and usually pretty accurate, 
but have a slower rate of fire than a semi-automatic. A semi-automatic is 
preferable in nearly all cases. The M-1 carbine is probably the best semi- 
automatic for the money (about $80). It's light, short, easy to handle and has only 
the drawback of a cartridge that's a little underpowered. Among bolt actions, the 
Springfield, Mauser, Royal Enfield, Russian 7.62, and the Lee Harvey Oswald 
Special, the Mannlicher-Carcano, are all good buys for the money (about $20). 
One of the best semi-automatics is the AR-18, which is the civilian version of the 
military M-1 6. In general, this is a fantastic gun with a high rate of fire, minimal 
recoil, high accuracy, light weight, and easy maintenance. If kept clean, it will 
rarely jam, and the bullet has astounding stopping power. It sells for around 
$225. 
SHOTGUNS 
The shotgun is the ideal defensive weapon. It's perfect for the vamping band of 
pigs or hard-heads that tries to lynch you. Being a good shot isn't that necessary 
because a shotgun shoots a bunch of lead pellets that spread over a wide range 
as they leave the barrel. There are two common types: the pump action and the 
semi-automatic. Single shot types and double-barrel types do not have a high 
enough rate of fire for self-defense. 
The pump action is easy to use and reliable. It usually holds about five shells in a 
tube underneath the barrel. For self-defense you should use 00 buckshot shells. 
Shotguns come in various gauges, but you will want the largest commonly 
available, the 12 gauge. The Mossberg Model 500 A is a super weapon in this 
category which sells for about $90. When buying one, try to get a shotgun with a 
barrel as short as possible up to the legal limit of 18 inches. It is easy to cut down 
a longer barrel, too. This increases the area sprayed. 
The semi-automatic gun is not used too much for self-defense, as they usually 
hold only three shells. With some practice, you can shoot a pump nearly as fast 
as a semi-automatic, and they are much cheaper. See the gun books catalogued 
in the Appendix for more information. 
There are many other good guns available, and a great deal to know about 
choosing the right gun for the right situation. Reading a little right wing gun 
literature will help. 
OTHER WEAPONS 
If you are around a military base, you will find it relatively easy to get your hands 
on an M-79 grenade launcher, which is like a giant shotgun and is probably the 
best self-defense weapon of all time. Just inquire discreetly among some long- 
haired soldiers. 
TRAINING 
Owning a gun ain't shit unless you know how to use it. They make a hell of a 
racket when fired so you just can't work out in your den or cellar except with a BB 
gun, which is good in between real practice sessions. Find a buddy who served 
in the military or is into hunting or target-shooting and ask him to teach you the 
fundamentals of gun handling and safety. If you're over 18, you can practice on 
one of your local firing ranges. Look them up in the Yellow Pages, call and see if 
they offer instructions. They are usually pretty cheap to use. In an hour, you can 
learn the basics you need to know about guns and the rest is mostly practice, 
practice, just like in the westerns. Contact the National Rifle Association, 
Washington D.C. and ask for information on forming a gun club. If you can, you 
are entitled to great discounts, have no trouble using ranges and get excellent 
info on all matters relating to weapons. 
A secluded place in the country outside city limits, makes an ideal range for 
practicing. Shoot at positioned targets. A good idea is to blow up balloons and 
attach them to pieces or boxes. Position yourself downstream alongside a 
running brook. A partner can go upstream and release the balloons into the 
water. As they rush downstream, they simulate an attacker charging you and 
make excellent moving targets. Watch out for ricochetting bullets. Have any 
bystander stand by behind you. A clothesline with a pulley attachment can be 
rigged up to also allow practice with a moving target. 
GUN LAWS 
Once you decide to get a gun, check out the local laws. There are federal ones, 
but they're not stricter than any state ordinance. If you're unsure about the laws, 
send 750 to the U.S. Government Printing Office for the manual called Published 
Ordinances: Firearms. It runs down the latest on all state laws. In most states 
you can buy a rifle or shotgun just for the bread from a store or individual if you 
are over 18 years old. You can get a handgun when you can prove you're over 
21, although you generally need a special permit to carry it concealed on your 
person or in your car. A concealed weapon permit is pretty hard to get unless 
you're part of the establishment. You can keep a handgun in your home, though. 
It's also generally illegal to walk around with a loaded gun of any type. Once you 
get the hang of using a gun, you'll never want to go back to the old peashooter. 
Let's see now, you run the fuse thru the clock face 
and fasten it to your left toe 
The Underground 
Amerika is just another Latin dictatorship. Those who have doubts, should try the 
minimal experience of organizing a large rock festival in their state*, sleeping on 
some beach in the summer or wearing a flag shirt. Ask the blacks what it's been 
like living under racism and you'll get a taste of the future we face. As the 
repression increases so will the underground-deadly groups of stoned 
revolutionaries sneaking around at night and balling all day. As deadly as their 
southern comrades the Tupamaros. Political trials will only occur when the heavy 
folks are caught. Too many sisters and brothers have been locked up for long 
stretches having maintained a false faith in the good will of the court system. 
Instead, increased numbers have chosen to become fugitives from injustice: 
Bernadine Dohrn, Rap Brown, Mark Rudd, hundreds of others. Some including 
Angela Davis, Father Berrigan and Pun Plamondon have been apprehended and 
locked in cages, but most roam freely and actively inside the intestines of the 
system. Their growth leads to persistent indigestion for those who sit at the 
tables of power. As they form into active isolated cells they make apprehension 
difficult. Soon the FBI will have a Thousand Most Wanted List. Our heroes will be 
hunted like beasts in the jungle. Anyone who provides information leading to the 
arrest of a fugitive is a traitor. 
*Unless you want to use our music to attack our politics as the governor of 
Oregon did to drain support away from demonstrations against the AmeriKKKan 
Legion. In such a situation the concert should be sabotaged along with political 
education as to why such an action has been taken. Don't let the pigs separate 
our culture from our politics. 
Well fellow reader, what will you do when Rap or Bernadine call up and ask to 
crash for the night? What if the Armstrong Brothers want to drop some acid at 
your pad or Kathy Boudin needs some bread to keep on truckin'? The entire 
youth culture, everyone who smiles secretly when President Agnew and General 
Mitchell refer to the growing number of "hot-headed revolutionaries", all the folks 
who hope the Cong wins, who cheer the Tupamaros on, who want to exchange 
secret handshakes with the Greek resistance movement, who say "It's about 
time" when the pigs get gunned down in the black community, all of us have an 
obligation to support the underground. They are the vanguard of our revolution 
and in a sense this book is dedicated to their courage. 
If you see a fugitive's picture on the post office wall take it home for a souvenir. 
But watch out, because this is illegal. Soon the FBI will be printing all our posters 
for free. Right on, FBI! Print up wanted posters of the war criminals in 
Washington and undercover agents (be absolutely sure) and put them up 
instead. Since the folks underground move freely among us, we must be totally 
cool if by chance we recognize a fugitive through their disguise. If they deem it 
necessary to contact you, they will make the first move. If you are very active in 
the aboveground movement, chances are you are being watched or tapped and 
it would be foolhardy to make contact. The underground would be meaningless 
without the building of a massive community with corresponding political goals. 
People above ground demonstrate their love for fugitives by continuing and 
intensifying their own commitment. 
If the FBI or local subversive squad of the police department is asking a lot of 
questions about certain fugitives, get the word out. Call your underground paper 
or make the announcement at large movement gatherings or music festivals; the 
grapevine will pass information on to those that need to know. 
If you're forced to go underground, don't think you need to link up with the more 
well-known groups such as the Weathermen. If you go under with some close 
friends, stick together if it's possible. Build contacts with aboveground people that 
are not that well known to the authorities and can be totally trusted. 
You should change the location in which you operate and move to a place where 
the heat on yon won't be as heavy. A good disguise should be worked out. The 
more information the authorities have on you and the heavier the charges 
determine how complete your disguise should be. There are some good tips in 
the books on make-up listed in the Appendix. Only in rare cases is it necessary 
to abandon the outward appearance of belonging to the youth culture. In fact, 
even J. Edgar Freako admits that our culture is our chief defense. To infiltrate the 
youth culture means becoming one of us. For an FBI agent to learn an 
ideological cover is a highly disciplined organization is relatively easy. To 
penetrate the culture means changing the way they live. The typical agent would 
stand out like Jimmy Stewart in a tribe of Apaches. 
In the usual case the authorities do not look for a fugitive in the sense of carrying 
on a massive manhunt. Generally, people are caught for breaking some minor 
offense and during the routine arrest procedure, their fingerprints give them 
away. Thus for a fugitive having good identification papers being careful about 
violations such as speeding or loitering, and not carrying weapons or bombing 
manuals become an important part of the security. It is also a good idea to have 
at least a hundred dollars cash on you at all times. Often even if you are arrested 
you can bail yourself out and split long before the fingerprints or other 
identification checks are completed. 
If by some chance you are placed on the "10 Most Wanted List" that is a signal 
that the FBI are indeed conducting a manhunt. It is also the hint that they have 
uncovered some clues and feel confident they can nab you soon. The List is a 
public relations gimmick that Hooper, or whatever his name is, dreamed up to 
show the FBI as super sleuths, and compliment the bullshit image of them that 
Hollywood lays down. Most FBI agents are southerners who majored in 
accounting or some other creative field. When you are placed on the List, go 
deeper underground. It may become necessary to curtail your activities for a 
while. The manhunt lasts only as long as you are newsworthy since the FBI is 
very media conscious. Change your disguise, identification and narrow your 
circle of contacts. In a few months, when the heat is off, you'll be able to be more 
active, but for the time, sit tight. 
IDENTIFICATION PAPERS 
An amateur photographer or commercial artist with good processing equipment 
can make passable phony identification papers. Using a real I.D. card, mask out 
the name, address, and signature with thin strips of paper the same color as the 
card itself. Do a neat gluing job. Next, photograph the card using bright overhead 
lighting to avoid shadows, or xerox it. Use a paper of a color and weight as close 
to the real thing as you can get. If you use phony state and city papers such as 
birth certificate or driver's license, choose a state that is far away from the area in 
which you are located. Have a complete understanding of all the information you 
are forging. Dates, cities, birthdays and other data are often part of a coding 
system. Most are easy to figure out simply by studying a few similar authentic 
cards. 
Almost all I.D. cards use one or another IBM Selectric type to fill in the 
individual's papers. You can buy the exact model used by federal and state 
agencies for less than $20.00 and install the ball in 5 seconds on any Selectric 
machine. When you finish the typing operation, sign your new name and trim the 
card to the size you want. Rub some dirt on the card and bend it a little to 
eliminate its newness. 
Another method is to obtain a set of papers from a close friend of similar 
characteristics. Your friend can replace the originals without too much trouble. In 
both cases it might be advisable to get authentic papers using the phonies you 
have in your possession. In some states getting a license or voting registration 
card is very easy. Library cards and other supplementary I.D.'s are simple to get. 
A passport should not be attempted until you definitely have made up your mind 
to split the country. That way agencies have less time to check the information 
and you can decide on the disguise to be used for the picture. Unless you expect 
to get hotter than you are right now, in which case, get it now. 
It is wise to have two sets of identification to be on the safe side but never have 
both in your possession at the same time. If you sense the authorities are close 
to mailing you and choose to go underground, prepare all the identification 
papers well in advance and store them in a secure place. Inform no one of your 
possible new identity. 
Before you start passing phony I.D.'s to cops, banks and passport offices, you 
should have experience with lesser targets so you feel comfortable using them. 
There are stiff penalties for this if you get caught. A few better methods than the 
ones listed above exist, but we feel they should not be made this public. With a 
little imagination you'll have no trouble. Dig! 
COMMUNICATION 
Living underground, like exile, can be extremely lonely, especially during the 
initial adjustment period when you have to reshuffle your living habits. 
Psychologically it becomes necessary to maintain a few close contacts with other 
fugitives or folks aboveground. This is also necessary if you plan to continue 
waging revolutionary struggle. This means communication. If you contact 
persons or arrange for them to contact you, be super cool. Don't rush into 
meetings. Stay OFF the phone! If you must, use pay phones. Have the contact 
person go to a prescribed booth at prescribed time. Knowing the phone number 
beforehand, you can call from another pay phone. The pay phone system is 
superior to debugging devices and voice scramblers. Even so, some pay phones, 
that local police suspect bookies use, are monitored. 
Keep your calls short and disguise your voice a bit. If you are a contact and the 
call does not come as scheduled, don't panic. Perhaps the booth at the other end 
is occupied or the phone you are on is out of order. In New York, the latter is 
usually true. Wait a reasonable length of time and then go about your business. 
Another contact will be made. Personal rendezvous should take place at places 
that are not movement hangouts or heavy pig scenes. Intermediaries should be 
used to see if anyone was followed. Just groove on a few good spy flicks and 
you'll figure it all out. 
Communicating to masses of people above ground is very important. It drives the 
MAN berserk and gives hope to comrades in the struggle. The most important 
message is that you are alive, in good spirits and carrying on the struggle. The 
communications of the Weathermen are brilliantly conceived. Develop a mailing 
list that you keep well hidden in case of a bust. You can devise a system of 
mailing stuff in envelopes (careful of fingerprints) inside larger envelopes to a 
trusted contact who will mail the items from another location to further 
camouflage your area of operation. A host of communication devices are 
available besides handwritten notes and typed communications. Tape recorders 
are excellent but better still are video-tape cassette machines. You can wear 
masks, do all kinds of weird theatrical stuff and send the tapes to television 
stations. At times you might want to risk being interviewed by a newsman, but 
this can be very dangerous unless you conceive a super plan and have some 
degree of trust in the word of the journalist. Don't forget a grand jury could be 
waiting for him with a six months contempt or perjury charge when he admits 
contact and does not answer their questions. 
The only other advice is to dress warm in the winter and cool in the summer, stay 
high and...

THE SUBWAY SYSTEM 
The first thing to do is get familiar with the geography of stops you use most 
frequently. Locate the token cage. Check to see whether the exits are within easy 
view of the teller, off to the side, or blocked from view by concrete pole- 
supporters. Next learn the type of turnstile in use. Follow the hints laid down in 
the Free Transportation section. 
The rush hours are always the easiest times. Just go through the exits as people 
push open the door. Also at crowded hours, people go single file past the 
turnstiles, one after another in a steady stream. Get in line and go under. The 
people will block you from view and won't do anything. Even a cop won't give you 
much hassle. Some subway stations have concrete supports that block the 
teller's view. Where these exist, slip through the exit nearest the pole or slide by 
the turnstile. 
Turnstile jumping is such a skill, it's going to be added to the Olympics. There are 
three basic styles common to New York and most cities and each needs a 
slightly different approach. 
The Old Wooden Cranker-(Traditional) You have to go under or sail over this 
type. Going under is a smoother trip. Going over is trickier since you need both 
hands free to hurdle and it's a quicker, more noticeable motion. 
New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstiles-Which-Turn-Both-Ways-For-Exit-and- Entrance- 
Approach it with confidence. Pretend you're putting in a token with your right 
hand and pull the bar toward you one third of the way with your left hand. Go 
through the space left between the bars and the barrier. Not for heavyweights! 
New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstiles-Which-Can-Be- Used-Only-For-Entrance-They 
won't pull towards you, and so, you must go either under or over them. 
NOTE: There is no way to tell a New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstile-Which-Turns-Both- 
- Ways-For-Exit-and-Entrance from a New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstile-Which- Can- 
Be-Used-Only-For-Entrance unless there is a sign. You have to try it first. 
Therefore, it is important to remember which kind is in use at your local station so 
your technique will be smooth. Once you're through, remember in your mind 
you've paid. Ignore everybody who tries to stop you or tell you different. If 
someone shouts just keep on truckin' on toward your track. Don't stop or run. 
Insist you are right if you ever get caught. We have been doing it for years, got 
caught twice and let go both tunes when other passengers insisted we paid. 
Everybody hates the subways, even the tellers. 
FREEBIES 
Clothing Repairs 
All Wallach stores feature a service that includes sewing on buttons, free shoe 
horns, and shoe laces, mending pants pockets and linings, punching extra holes 
in belts, and a number of other free services. 
Furniture 
By far the best place to get free furniture in New York is on the street. Once a 
week in every district, the Sanitation Department makes bulk pick-ups. The night 
before, residents put out all kinds of stuff on the street. For the best selection try 
the West Village on Monday nights, and the East Seventies on Tuesday nights. 
On Wednesday night there are fantastic pick-ups on 35th St. in-back of Macy's. 
Move quickly though, the guards get pissed off easily; the truckers couldn't care 
less. This street method can furnish your whole pad. Beds, desks, bureaus, 
lamps, bookcases, chairs, and tables. It's all a matter of transportation. If you 
don't have access to a car or truck, it's worth it to rent a station wagon and make 
pick-ups. 
Ghosts 
If you would like to meet a real ghost, write Hans Holtzer, c/o New York 
Committee for Investigation for Paranormal Research, 140 Riverside Drive, New 
York, NY. He'll put you in touch for free.

The Staten Island Ferry-Not free, but a nickel each way for a five mile ocean 
voyage around the southern tip of Manhattan is worth it. Take IRT (Broadway 
line) to South Ferry, local only. Ferry leaves every half-hour day and night. 
Drugs 
In the area along Central Park West in the Seventies and Eighties are located 
many doctor's offices. Daily they throw out piles of drug samples. If you know 
what you're looking for, search this area. 
Books 
You can always use the library. The main branch is on Fifth Ave. and 42nd St. 
The Public Library prints a leaflet entitled "It's Your Library" which lists all the 168 
branches and special services the library provides. You can pick it up at your 
nearest branch. They also publish a calendar of events every two weeks which is 
available free. If you have any questions call 791 -6161.

Mission, 67th St., will give you free copies of Granma, the Cuban newspaper,

HOUSING 
Contrary to rumors, none of us have ever been to Chicago. None-the-less, we 
have some friends who have visited the area. In Chicago, everyone 17 or under 
must be off the streets by 10:30 PM and by 11:30 PM on Fridays and Saturdays. 
Don't sleep in Lincoln Park during political conventions, but other nights it's O.K. 
Wasn't it Hillel who asked, "Why is this night different from all other nights?" And 
wasn't it Mayor Richard J. Daley who responded, "Cause I say get your ass out 
of the park!" 
The Chicago Seed (929-0133) will give you the best advice on crashing and the 
local heat scene. Grace Lutheran Church, 555 W. Beldon St., and the Looking 
Glass at 1725 W. Wilson also have crashing places or know where you can find 
free room and board. 
You won't get hassled if you sack out in the Union Station on Adams Street just 
over the bridge. There are loads of folks crashing in abandoned buildings along 
LaSalle and other streets. Also the rooftops are cool. Stay off the streets though, 
unless you've got good identification. 
FOOD 
SCLC (Operation Breadbasket) has a free breakfast program every morning 
Monday through Friday from 7-10 AM at St. Anna Church, 55th St. and LaSalle

There are real cheap restaurants. One is a truck-stop in Skokie called Karl's 
Cafe. It's just north of Oakton on Skokie Highway. It's open until 6:00. You get a 
whole lot of food for $1 .00. Also, under the viaduct at Milwaukee and Damen is a 
small restaurant with Polish food. You can get a great meal for $1.35. It's worth a 
visit. It closes early in the evening. Another cheap restaurant is Paul and Ernie's 
on North Lincoln, just south of Wrightwood. You can have a beef dinner for about 
70 cents. 
A good place to pick up free vegetables and fruits is at the wholesale market on 
Randolph St. or S. Water St. on Friday afternoons. Many of the food factories 
such as Kraft Dairy Products give away free samples and cases for "charity." 
Check them out. 
It is possible to steal food from the 2nd floor Federal Building Cafeteria at Adams 
and Dearborn and the National Cafeteria at Clark and Van Buren. These 
cafeterias usually have long lines and you can eat while standing and just pay for 
the coffee. 
If you have a place to cook and store food, there are a few places that have 
pretty cheap food. The east gate of International Harvester, located at 1015 W. 
120th St. is unbelievable. Dig these bargains! 10 pounds of T-bone steaks 
(boxed) for $5.25 at midnight, at 4 PM, the produce man brings a different 
combination of goods. Atypical bill of fare might include tomatoes, cucumbers, 
strawberries, etc. at $1 .00 for 10 pounds of any item. The produce might vary 
from day to day, but the prices stay the same. On Thursdays at noon and 4 PM, 
the Lennell cookie man comes around. It's $1 .25 per box. At 7 PM, the sausage 
man arrives and the standard price is $2.00. The standard size is 3 to 5 pounds. 
He has salami, liver sausage, polish sausage, and usually odd lunchmeat such 
as bologna or summer sausage. All the food is sold out of trucks, and the prices 
might not be exact, but they're pretty close. 
Eggs are about 3 dozen for $2.00 on Randolph west of Halsted. Orange juice is 
pretty cheap at the Del Farm on Broadway. Wonder Bread thrift store on 
Diversey; Butternut, 87th St. and Ridgeland and 1471 W. Wilson, and Silvercup,

Tuesday and Thursday, will give you cases free or at discounts if you tell them 
it's for charity or look straight. Two good spots for all around shopping are the Hi- 
Lo on Lincoln, north of Irving. There's lots of stuff for 10 cents. Marathon 
Products at Randolph and Halsted is another good place.

A prefatory note on Anarchism today 
by P. M. Bergman 
This is a brutal book — sensual, rude, coarse, and cruel. 
However, it is timely and well-written, even witty. Profes- 
sionally and painstakingly, all possible informative instruc- 
tions for individual actions of destruction having a pre- 
sumably social effect are detailed here. 
There is no political merit in publishing this book; it is 
not a call to action. For the real Hippy and Yippy, espe- 
cially for the rebellious student, it hardly contains anything 
basic that he does not already know. I believe that it is 
usually the “square guy” who wants to know what is going 
on, though (or because) shocked and even tantalized by 
such subjects. More often than not it is the subscriber to 
Reader’s Digest and Time who constitutes the literary mar- 
ket for such boring commodities as, for example. Games 
People Play. 
Still, the present book is an important reflection of 
American Anarchism. It has its historical precedent in a 
similar “Cookbook” which was published in many editions 
and sold openly around the turn of the century (by the 
Anarchist headquarters, at the time in New York City, 
167 William Street). Its title was Science of Revolutionary 
Warfare — A Handbook of Instruction regarding the Use 
and Manufacture of Nitroglycerine, Dynamite, Gun-Cot- 
ton, Fulminating Mercury, Bombs, Arsons, Poisons, etc. 
The book was written by the Anarchist J. H. Most, who 
was the teacher of Emma Goldman.* 
* Johann Joseph Most (1846-1906), a bookbinder by trade, was 
one of the first Marxist deputies to the German Reichstag. He wrote 
the first popularization of Capital. For his very radical publications 
against religion and patriotism, he was several times imprisoned. 
We live in an age of anarchy both abroad and 
at home. 
— President Richard M. Nixon 
Confronted with a choice, the American people 
would choose the policeman’s truncheon over 
the Anarchist’s bomb. 
— Vice President Spiro T. Agnew 
The revolutionary reaches beyond dissent to 
nihilism and anarchy. 
— Mayor John V. Lindsay 
I believe it to be very characteristic that such a book 
appeared only in this country. The same is true of the pres- 
ent “Cookbook.” One might think this is because of the 
American constitutional “freedom of speech.” But in other 
countries even the clandestine literature does not, so far as 
I know, show any similarities to such a “Cookbook.” Blan- 
qui’s famous “Instructions for Insurrection” concentrates 
on mass actions (even if initiated by Elites) like the build- 
ing of barricades — something which neither Most’s Science 
nor the present “Cookbook” gives any attention to. And this, 
in fact, expresses the basic difference — I think the only dif- 
ference, even — between what is usually called Anarchism 
and revolutionary Marxism. I would like to go further and 
emphasize the specific nature of American Anarchism with- 
out denying that this local form still is Anarchism. 
The word “Anarchism” as used in the present book 
might be somewhat misleading, even a misnomer. As often 
happens, it is confused with “Nihilism” — a word which 
Wendell Phillips favorably used after it was introduced by 
Turgenjev in Fathers and Sons. It frequented Russian liter- 
ature until the time of Artzybashev. The chapter on nar- 
cotics, therefore, belongs to the present book. “Free Love” 
and in 1878 had to flee Germany. In England, because of his 
extreme Anarchist views, Most broke with Marx and, after serving 
eighteen months at hard labor for advocating regicide, he emigrated 
in 1882 to the United States. Here he was, at the time of the Hay- 
market Square riot, considered the inspiration of radicalism through- 
out the country, but later, during the Homestead strike, Most spoke 
out against Berkman’s assault on Henry Clay Frick. He was im- 
prisoned for alleged sedition after the assassination of President 
McKinley. 
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK / 9 
10 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
(also religion) is missing here, for the good reason that it 
lost its sensational popularity in the Anarchist kitchen. 
Thus the popular synonymous use of Anarchism for Nihil- 
ism is understandable: Dostoyevsky’s Netshayev was, after 
all, an important collaborator of Bakunin. 
Nihilism is Anarchism, and Nihilism is revolutionary al- 
though it is an aberration of Anarchism. Like all other 
modern revolutionary tendencies, it is based philosophi- 
cally on the Hegelian axiom: “Negation of Negation,” which 
Friedrich Engels approvingly resolved with Goethe’s 
words: “All that exists is worth perishing”; or, as recently 
expressed more simply in a note left in a bank burned by 
Anarchists in West Berlin: “Make kaputt what makes you 
kaputt 
Not only Anarchism, but any other real revolutionary 
movement is dragged into some forms of Nihilism. This 
understandably occurs especially in the formative stages as 
well as sometimes in the declining, depressive stages. Who 
can deny the historical importance of the wrecking of 
machinery by the Luddites (though today we are so clever 
that we tell them what they should have done instead)? 
There is no doubt that the assassination of czars and Rus- 
sian governors effected, if nothing else, different treatment 
of political “criminals” — something which still has not been 
achieved in the “free” United States. Without denying the 
truly revolutionary character of the Palestinian comman- 
dos, their newest weapon, hijacking, is surely an aberration 
in their struggle for recognition. But the taking of hostages 
is nothing new in revolutionary history. The Paris Com- 
mune did it, as well as such partisans as the Titoists in 
Yugoslavia, the Maquis in France, and, before them, the 
Max-Hoelz Brigade in Weimar Germany. 
“Putschismus,” as it is called in German, or “coup de 
main,” in French, is not limited to Anarchism. In the early 
twenties in Germany, attempts at bombing of public toilets 
and of the victory memorial in Berlin, or the famous bomb- 
ing of the cathedral in Sofia ( 1923), and many other such 
“actions” were tacitly approved and initiated by Commu- 
nists, especially at the time of their decline. 
The main aspect of Anarchist actions, which surely do 
not conform with the civilized rules of politics and war- 
fare (no government abides by them either, by the way) 
is to draw attention more to the existence of the movement 
than to its ideas. The attempt to free prisoners by taking 
hostages, or to reduce mistreatment of prisoners by indi- 
vidual attacks on officials and by bomb scares, will not create 
sympathy. However, it might lead to a “giving-in” by the 
government, forcing it to recognize the existence of the 
illegal Anarchist movement. As a matter of fact, the gov- 
ernment itself commits an illegal act by “giving-in” to the 
assault. Usually a government fares better by “giving in,” 
but, on the other hand, one of the criteria of a revolution- 
ary situation is that a stage is reached where the govern- 
ment feels it can no longer give in. 
Calling a policeman a “pig” seems silly and must antag- 
onize the very people the revolutionaries want to win over 
or to neutralize. But the actual relationships of power are 
such that name-calling is the only weapon available at the 
moment. Besides, name-calling is an emotional outlet (and 
revolutionaries also have emotions). “Pig” is an assault, 
no doubt — an assault against the uniform which, though a 
fetish, is in itself a power, an assault against the whole 
power structure. It is an assault — and a crime punishable 
by law. Here is the strong policeman, heavily armed, with 
the entire physical and ideological power of the state be- 
hind him, and he is attacked by a word — by a word only, 
but it is still an attack. 
What will the “pig” do? In the last analysis it is not up 
to the policeman, who, though having a loaded gun in his 
hand, has in fact no power; it is up to the state to give the 
answer. It might not be “smart” of Bobby Seale to provoke 
his jailers by repeatedly calling them “pigs,” therefore 
getting brutally beaten and put in isolation. But “pig” is 
his only means of defense against the attacks upon his 
humanity at the moment and gives him a chance to get 
recognition for his beliefs and as a human being. 
Basically what applies to the silly “pigs”-calling is also 
valid for the often Hollywoodlike hijackings, the taking of 
hostages, and even for the more harmful “Anarchist cook- 
ing.” These methods are not “smart”; they are aberrations 
which sometimes border on insanity. But these methods 
of the revolutionary struggle of today are here and existing 
and real and, in the philosophical sense, reasonable. They 
reflect the true stage of the revolutionary struggle in the 
whole world. Its stage is today again embryonic. 
In describing the American Revolution, history text- 
books tell us only of such great episodes as the Boston 
Massacre, which unlocked the revolutionary spirit of the 
people; of the Boston Tea Party, which contested the pow- 
er of the British parliament; or of the Battle of Bunker Hill, 
which took on the form of a real revolutionary war. The 
history textbooks, however, fail to describe the “Anarchist 
cooking” and innumerable sabotage actions which surely 
were going on in the several decades before the actual 
revolution. One cannot doubt that the Hessian mercenaries 
were called names. 
The author of Anarchist Cookbook does not see in the 
individualistic acts of terror he describes the ultima ratio. 
He emphasizes that the real revolution will require the 
American people, and he has trust in them, but still he is 
not scared by the anger of short-sighted liberals and sensi- 
tive quasi-revolutionaries. However, I believe in the ap- 
proach that Marx took toward the different forms of revo- 
lutionary struggles. This approach was not at all abstractly 
“theoretical,” but very concrete and practical. It was 
limited to one question: “Whom does this serve?” But 
before dealing with this question, in regard to the “cook- 
ANARCHISM TODAY 
11 
ing,” it seems to me necessary to consider the all-important 
question: What is Anarchism? 
Anarchism as an idea is nonviolent. Its philosophy is 
Spinozan, ethical, and nature-loving. Anarchism in modern 
times began under the intellectual and spiritual influence 
of the French Revolution and the late stage of Enlighten- 
ment of the young-Hegelian school.* The progenitor of 
Anarchism is generally considered to be the German phil- 
osopher Max Stirner (Kaspar Schmidt, 1806-56), who in 
the tumultuous 1840’s came out with the obviously neu- 
rotic form of Individual Anarchism. Except in England, an 
industrial proletariat hardly existed at that time but, seem- 
ingly without communication with each other (the tele- 
graph was just invented), students in Paris and Rome, in 
Vienna, Berlin, and Madrid became rebellious. Interest- 
ingly, the only connection between the different places where 
students rioted was among the governments in suppressing 
these riots — the “Holy Alliance.” Even at that time, it was 
the “foreigners” who misled these boys from nice families, 
as Heinrich Heine’s verses satirically remind us. And, just 
as today, these students “never had it so good.” They were 
mostly sons of the new and prosperous middle classes. 
Many of these “bums” received scholarships and the “best 
education ever,” no doubt scholastically superior to the one 
Nixon in jus ignorance is raving about today. 
The idea of Anarchism already existed more universally 
when Stirner’s confused writings appeared. American An- 
archism began as far back as the 1 820’s with Josiah Warren, 
a New England Yankee of early colonial stock and a 
descendant of the famous Warren of Bunker Hill, who was 
followed by Ezra Heywood, William Greene, Lysander 
Spooner, Joshua Ingalls, Stephen P. Andrews, and later 
Benjamin Tucker. Thoreau is considered the American 
Anarchist par excellence, and, if we can believe Vernon 
Louis Parrington, all of the Adams family — from the two 
presidents to the brothers — wished nothing more than the 
burning of State Street, the site of Boston banking. (Par- 
rington quotes that Henry Adams was held back from 
Marxism by “some narrow trait of the New England na- 
ture.”) 
Years before the Haymarket Riot, Wendell Phillips — 
this old-fashioned Yankee soul who was of the opinion that 
“if it must be bullets, so be it” — addressed the respectable 
Fhi Beta Kappas at Harvard University with the words: 
Nihilism is righteous and honorable. Nihilism is evi- 
dence of life. The last weapon of victims choked and 
* Hegel introduced the idea of freedom into philosophy. Much 
clearer than in his pedantically obscurantist philosophical writings, 
which often looked as if he favored the existing Prussian King, Hegel 
unmistakingly expressed in his private letters the true meaning and 
the revolutionary character of his philosophy. For example, in a 
letter to Schelling: “The people will learn to feel the dignity of man. 
They will not merely demand their rights which have been trampled 
in the dust, but themselves will take them— make them their own.” 
manacled beyond all other resistance. I honor Nihilism, 
since it redeems human nature from the suspicion of 
being utterly vile, made up only of heartless oppressors 
and contented slaves. This is the only view an American, 
the child of 1620 and 1776, can take of Nihilism. Any 
other unsettles and perplexes the ethics of our civiliza- 
tion. 
Anarchism in America, as an idea as well as a movement, 
was much stronger and more conspicuous than Marxism, 
even though Marx moved the headquarters of the First 
International to this country. The “Wobblies,” who were 
the only ones representing the revolutionary labor move- 
ment, especially in the western United States, were un- 
doubtedly mostly Anarchists.* Later the impact of the 
Bolshevik revolution dominated and bureaucratized here 
all radical thought (the Communist Party in America was 
something like a slap in the face to Marx’s suggestion that 
“every revolution will bear the birthmark of the old society 
from whose womb it sprang”). Again, today, while in 
Europe and Asia the revolutionaries agitate in the name 
of Marx (and Lenin), in the United States Mao, Ho, Gue- 
vara, Castro, etc., are the ones who are worshiped. 
Anarchism as an idea reached its highest motives 
through the Darwin-Haeckel-inspired observation of Mu- 
tual Aid by Kropotkin. It also found strong support in 
Tolstoy’s Christianity of Civil Disobedience. Anarchism 
as a theory of political science, however, as founded by 
Proudhon and Bakunin, has exactly the same goals as 
Marxism: abolition of private property, the basis of eco- 
nomic exploitation; and abolition of the state, the institu- 
tion of social oppression. In this sense (and, after all, here- 
in lies the premise of all revolutionary argument) Marx 
and Lenin consented to be true Anarchists. “As long as 
there is the state there is no freedom; when there is free- 
dom there will be no state.” (Lenin) 
The formula of Blanqui (who was called by Marx “the 
heart and brain of the French proletariat”) was the con- 
necting word of Communism and Anarchism in the First 
International: “ni Dieu — ni Maitre.” Together, Proud- 
honists, Bakunists, Blanquists, and Marxists in the Paris 
Commune wrote, as Wendell Phillips said, “the grandest 
declaration of popular indignation on the pages of history 
in fire and blood.” (Phillips added, “I honor Paris as the 
vanguard of the Internationals of the world.”) And in the 
very beginning of Lenin’s Third International, up till the 
Kronstadt episode, Anarchists from France, Italy, Ger- 
many, and also from America (Emma Goldman and Alex- 
* From the beginning, no other political idea was so severely per- 
secuted in this country as Anarchism. Aside from the Chinese Exclu-

introduction of the quota system in 1924 was the law of 1901 for- 
bidding Anarchists (and prostitutes) to enter the United States.

ander Berkman) took part in the Comintern at Moscow.* 
Anarchism is anti-parliamentarian. So, in fact, is Marx- 
ism. The only difference is that Marx and Engels, Lenin 
and Rosa Luxemburg believed in making use of Parliament 
against the power of the existing government. They never 
allowed active participation in any but a revolutionary gov- 
ernment. The Paris Commune was surely not a parliament, 
and the Soviets of 1905 and 1917 came about as anarcho- 
syndicalist forms of free association completely independ- 
ent from political parties. 
Participation at elections is a purely tactical question. 
Anarchists in Romance countries sometimes took part in 
elections. Lenin was ambivalent toward elections to the 
Czarist Duma, and the first Communist Party Congress in 
Germany voted against participation (though their leader 
Rosa Luxemburg was for it). Today’s students in America, 
diligently canvassing for politicians, are in for disillusion- 
ment, if their campaign for Gene McCarthy has not already 
disappointed them. The surprising fact that in this freest 
democratic country there are millions of conscientious non- 
voters (more than anywhere else in the world) is evidence of 
an interesting mass basis for “Anarchist cooking.” It is a 
good sign for the ripening of revolutionary consciousness 
that, as James Reston reports in the New York Times, “all 
the excitement last spring about mounting a successive 
campaign by students to help elect peace candidates in the 
November elections has dwindled to a whisper.” 
Anarchism differs from Marxism in that the basic pre- 
mise of Marxism is the class struggle of the proletariat 
against the capitalistic form of production. Therefore, soci- 
ety’s taking possession of the means of production is, ac- 
cording to Marx, “the last act” the state fulfills. This state 
(“which is no longer a state”) is identical with the dictator- 
ship of the proletariat. By virtue of its permanent revolu- 
tionary character, the dictatorship of the proletariat con- 
sciously brings about such a condition that the state in any 
form withers away. 
Anarchism wants the abolition of the state out of hand, 
since neither economic change in general nor the prole- 
tariat as such seems to guarantee freedom and humanity. 
Marx’s whole revolutionary theory is based on his econom- 
ic critique of bourgeois society — on what he regards as the 
all-decisive conflict which exists between private owner- 
ship and social production. Only as a result of this struggle 
on the part of the very often lethargic proletarians, caused 
by “objective” economic conditions, among which the most 
* Lenin's Left-Wing Communism— an Infantile Disorder was an 
opportunistic pamphlet that paved the way for the Rapallo policy, 
which introduced the Soviet foreign policy of “coexistence.” Prob- 
ably Lenin himself did not realize that this booklet would help the 
Comintern bureaucracy get rid of the radical critics in the inter- 
national revolutionary movement— among them many of his closest 
friends outside Russia. It is interesting that today the foreign visitor 
will find at the bookstall in the Moscow airport huge stocks of this 
pamphlet in all languages, but State and Revolution is usually “out 
of stock.” 
important is the periodicity of crises, does true Communist 
society become possible and even unavoidable — while An- 
archism simply does not need a theory of economics. The 
same is true of all new revolutionary philosophies. Neither 
Sartre nor Marcuse bothers about economic theory, while 
for Marx and Lenin it was of the utmost importance. 
It is absolutely not true that Marx favored-state social- 
ism, as the social democrats and Soviet economists want us 
to believe. On the contrary, Capital characterizes all gov- 
ernmental economic measures — and especially state own- 
ership of industry — as “feudal-reactionary.”* By the way, 
almost all criticism of Soviet Russia is limited to the politi- 
cal and cultural brutality of its system. When it comes to 
economics, this system rectifies itself shamelessly by Marx- 
ist phraseology. Even revolutionaries believe it is a great 
thing that the Soviet state owns the means of production. 
Criticism of the Soviet Union almost never touches the 
main and real Marxian point that all the economic terms 
which, 1 according to Marx, characterize capital, like 
“wages,” “profit,” “accumulation,” and especially “value,” 
are officially recognized by the Soviet regime as valid for a 
socialist economy. Marx’s genial conception of the fetish- 
ism of commodities and the secret thereof, described in the 
first pages of Capital, is completely ignored. 
Of even greater importance is the so-called role of the 
proletariat. The proletariat is the main social contradiction 
of capitalist society. This postulate united German Com- 
munists, French Socialists, Russian Anarchists with Eng- 
lish Chartists around the Communist Manifesto in 1848 
during and after the student revolts all over Europe initi- 
ated mass insurrections. The proletariat was declared the 
gravedigger of capitalism, whereas the students were criti- 
cized as “utopian,” “reactionary,” and “petit bourgeois.” 
But whenever Marx came into contact with the real 
facts of the organized proletariat, his and Engels’ whole 
political life, as later that of Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, 
was a constant struggle which resulted dialectically from 
the general role of the proletariat. Capitalism does create 
through the proletariat its own gravedigger, but the pro- 
letariat is an integral part of capitalism. The well-being of 
capitalist economy is, in any existing conditions, the best 
possible condition for the material well-being of the pro- 
* In his criticism of the German Social Democratic Party pro- 
gram (Erfurt, 1891), Engels very sharply said that Marxism “has 
nothing in common with the so-called State Socialism, that system 
of nationalisation which puts the state in place of the private owner 
and by so doing Concentrates the power of economic exploitation 
and the political oppression of the workers in one hand.” 
There is no difference at all between Marxism and Anarchism in 
regard to the economics of Socialism. In the famous closing state- 
ment of the first volume of Capital, where Marx predicts “the expro- 
priation of the expropriators,” he makes it clear that the Negation of 
Negation will not reestablish private property (which in fact is being 
destroyed by corporate capitalism). He observes, however, that it 
will “certainly establish individual property, based on cooperation 
and the possession in common of the land and the means of produc- 
tion.”

letariat. Marx was completely aware of this decisive con- 
tradiction and therefore emphasized the position which 
his Communists take toward the proletarian masses. 
The proletarians are interested in economic affluence in 
its simplest form — dollars and cents — regardless of 
whether capitalism is private or state or semi-socialistic. 
In some ways they are even more interested in, and very 
apologetic toward, any militaristic-industrial establishment 
which guarantees employment, health insurance, and wage 
levels which can be attained without costly strikes. As long 
as there is affluence which provides even a measure of 
freedom of competition among “equals,” as long as in- 
creased productivity and a “just” distribution of produced 
wealth let the proletarian have a share (its relative size — 
an important factor in Marx’s analyses — is unimportant 
to him) , what logical interest can he have in economic re- 
cession, depression, slumps, and crises, about which old 
Marx was so avid in his letters and which were once so 
ardently desired in the reports made up by the Comintern- 
economist Varga? On the contrary from a simple, logical 
point of view, the leaders of trade unions and of established 
Socialist, and Communist parties became the healers of 
society’s economic and social sicknesses. Their bureau- 
cratic degeneration is only part of their function — and 
secondary. Their corruption is only a symptom which 
helps, as in any state system. 
Interesting in this connection is W.E.B. DuBois’s analysis 
of the English and German Socialist immigrants who came 
here as political refugees and first blurted out their dis- 
approbation of Negro slavery on principle. Later they 
found they could increase wages and regulate working con- 
ditions much better in the United States than in Europe. 
This happy discovery, instead of increasing sympathy for 
the slave, turned the attitude of the immigrants directly in- 
to rivalry and enmity. “The wisest of the leaders,” DuBois 
observed, “could not clearly envisage how slave labor in 
conjunction and competition with free labor tended to re- 
duce all labor toward slavery. For this reason, the union 
and labor leaders gravitated toward the political party 
which opposed tariff bounties and welcomed immigrants, 
quite forgetting this same Democratic party had as its back- 
bone the planter oligarchy of the South with its slave 
labor.” This was and still is the role of organized labor 
with regard to the Negro question and party politics. 
It has been true even in those cases when organized labor 
was committed to Socialism and Communism. Needless to 
say. this attitude was always heavily criticized by Marx. 
Thus the organized proletariat became in fact a conditio 
sine qua non for existing society. Without social democratic 
bureaucrats and without Communist apparatshiks, Euro- 
pean capitalism could hardly have survived after the First 
World War. Even more so everywhere today, including in 
the so-called “developing countries,” classical capitalism 
has no chance whatsoever without social democracy and 
Communist bureaucracy. Look at India — this greatest 
wonder of misery in the whole world is held together today 
by Liberal, Socialist, and even Communist bureaucracy. 
It is perhaps more corrupt than anywhere else in the 
world. Preaching nonviolence, it is in actual practice very 
violent toward its dissenters. It is only proper that India is 
the ideal of the liberals, such as John Kenneth Galbraith. * 
Marx emphasized that it is trot the worker’s conscious- 
ness that leads him to revolution. It is the “objective situa- 
tion” which will drive him to his historical role. In May, 
1968, the students of Paris realized that they needed the 
help of the workers — that no revolution is possible with- 
out the proletariat. Remaining a rebellion of students, it 
can never become a revolution. 
What do these naughty, ill-behaving, and ungrateful stu- 
dents want? We could quote Marx and Bakunin and Blan- 
qui and Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg and Trotsky. I prefer 
to mention a recent resolution passed by students of the 
very “square” Harvard Business School and published as 
an ad in the Wall Street Journal: 
We condemn the administration of President Nixon 
for its view of mankind and the American community 
which ... is unwilling to move for a transformation of 
American society in accordance with the goals of maxi- 
mum fulfillment for each human being and harmony 
between mankind and nature. 
This’is not only the idea, it is even the language, of 
Hegel and Marx. Those students have already passed the 
stage of protesting against the obscene war in Vietnam and 
the stage of the silliness of Hickel’s “Earth' Day.” No stu- 
dent in America (and in Russia) believes any more that 
the Second World War was fought because Hitler killed six 
million Jews, but the textbooks, written by Liberals and 
Socialists, still say it. These students are now on the way to 
finding out that basically everything Lenin wrote about 
the First World War can be applied to the Second World 
War as well as to the conflict in the Near East. They are 
discovering, too, that what he wrote on imperialism is still 
valid for state capitalism, which must lead, if left to its 
“natural” development, to planned barbarism. 
After so much costly confusion created mostly because 
the Russian Marxists were not able to cope with internal 
and international conditions, and after their intellectual 
fellow travelers covered up every Robespierian terror 
(and now after the “Gods have failed them” are angry 
about the Egyptian expedition of the little Napoleons in the 
Kremlin), the writings of Marx were put on the highest 
* Significantly, there are hardly any Anarchists (or Nihilists) in 
India. It is also interesting that ideologically Anarchism, even in its 
individualistic forms, has never been “Faustian” or Nietzschean or 
Spenglerian. Philosophically, today’s Hippies and Yippies, though 
a number of them are somehow “mystic,” are in complete contrast 
to the Jeremiad of the decline of the world. Toynbee does not inter- 
est them.

/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
pedestal of modern philosophy, called psychology and 
sociology (whatever that means). At the same time only 
naive “Anarchists" and incorrigible “dogmatists” still 
dared to believe in the great Marxian perception that the 
social destiny of man is his own work and that his goal — 
the solution of his fundamental historical 'problem, of his 
misery — can only be the abolition of state, of government 
in any 'form. And thus the emancipation of humanity re- 
quires revolution. This is the real principle of Anarchism. 
It is the quintessence of Marx and Bakunin and also of Tol- 
stoy. What have the Liberals, Socialists, and Communists 
to offer instead? 
When the students became more and more disturbed 
as they saw the illusory and contradictory conditions 
around them and throughout the world, with no solution in 
sight (as did the students in the times of young Marx), 
the psychology and sociology professors in Heidelberg, 
Paris, and Boston and also in Warsaw and Zagreb came 
out with a word which they found in the newly discovered 
early philosophical manuscripts by Marx. ( He himself said 
that he preferred to leave those early manuscripts to the 
“gnawing critique of the mice.”) The word was Alienation. 
Alienation is the basic evil of the world. So is “Pollution;” 
the newest fashionable word in politics. “Alienation” is 
class-less, and that is why it became a shibboleth of the 
critical minds of the philosophers. Although it really is 
revolutionary (after all it is Marxist), “Alienation” be- 
came fashionable and perfectly legal, in Poland as well as 
in Spain. This was for the very same reason that Marx 1 25 
years ago had no more use for it from the moment he gave 
up the narrow academic life and began to take an active 
part in the real movement in France. It was then he turned 
from Hegelian philosophy, aesthetics, and psychology to 
revolution, and said: The philosophers are trying to in- 
terpret the world differently — what matters is to change 
the world. 
It is tragic that those professors whose learned efforts in 
the fields of sociology and history, and in a wider sense of 
philosophy and psychology, bring them nearest to the real 
facts of life, which one would think are forcing them to 
make the jump to revolution (it can only be a jump!) — 
that those professors especially are most alienated and are 
left behind by the students. Those rebellious students are 
so nasty that they show them the behind (imagine, to those 
well-meaning professors! ) . Thus we learn from a report in 
the book publishers’ trade weekly that Nixon’s “bums” have 
stopped reading books. What books? Symptomatically, the 
same periodical reports that in Germany the students are 
reading mostly nineteenth-century books. 
Interestingly, it is different in the field of the sciences, 
where there is a more real connection with production and 
business and where the students acquire something like the 
role the highly qualified worker used to have. (It is well- 
known that this worker was the intellectually advanced, 
class-conscious stock of the old revolutionary movement 
in Europe.) This also might explain why frequently Nobel 
prize winners like Szent-Gyorgyi, Wald, and Pauling (to 
mention only American ones) are sympathetic toward the 
rebellious students — in fact, most of those scientists con- 
done Anarchist “cooking” all the way, starting with the 
first chapter on dope. Today, an Einstein (who, by the 
way, was a pronounced Anarchist) would probably not go 
to the president to draw his attention to the military mean- 
ing of a discovery like the one by Hahn-Meitner. He would 
probably go with his information to the Anarchists. How 
frightening to think that among today’s Italian students 
there might be a new Enrico Fermi! 
The students are warned by Bruno Bettelheim, by Irving 
Howe, by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and by the established 
head of the emptiest philosophy in America, the Social 
Democrat Professor, Sydney Hook, that “Anarchist cook- 
ing” will lead to the situation that prevailed in Italy and 
Germany before Mussolini and Hitler took over. The 
“backlash” argument is as old as written history — even 
biblical — and could be chewed on endlessly. It would 
doubtless be a waste' of space to quote what Marx and 
Lenin had to say about, “They should not have taken up 
the arms.” Aside from 'all that, the historical analogy which 
Liberals are warning the students about is rubbish. Histori- 
cal comparison is certainly necessary and for good reasons 
plays a big part in revolutionary literature. But no compari- 
son with the pre-Hitler period can be proven by one single 
social, economic, political, or cultural event (aside the 
fact that Hitler could not have come to power without the 
tacit support of the Vatican, the Quai d’Orsay and the 
Foreign Office figuring that Hitler would fulfill his Drang 
nach Osten — something similar to the newest desire for a 
war between Russia and China). 
When Hitler came to power, no war was going on, labor 
did not ask for higher wages, prices were deflating. Surel> 
there was no “affluence.” Students were not shaking the 
educational system. Racial or national minority struggle 
for equality did not exist. (Anti-Semitism did not arise be- 
cause Jews asked for equal rights.) All such things hap- 
pened, however, in Russia in 1905. One more interesting 
criterion: Unlike Italy and Germany, Russia at that time, 
like this country today, had no labor movement to speak of.* 
* It is true that, in the immediate pre-Nazi period, the German 
Communist Party— on instructions from Moscow— “cooked anar- 
chistically,” throwing bombs, killing policemen, and initiating acts 
of senseless terror, even in cooperation with Nazi gangs. But it is 
false and only a legend that the transfer of power to Hitler by the 
German industrialists and the military was a “backlash from the 
Bolshevik danger.” All the documents which have come out since 
the collapse of the Nazi regime, among them reports on conferences 
within the Hindenburg clique and the circles of big business and 
Prussian Junkers, do not even mention any serious concern about 
Communist activities. Rather, we find that breaking the power at 
the Social Democratic Party and the big trade unions was the fore- 
most consideration of the Hindenburg-Papen-Schleicher group and 
of big business. In fact, the decisive act in paving the way for the

Dr. Bettelheim refers to the noisy, nauseating students at 
the Vienna University giving him a traumatic experience, 
and without a blink he — as a scientist — simply equates 
“students” with “students.” One hopes that this therapist 
does not in his profession treat all children alike. Aside 
from the decisive fact that those Vienna students Dr. Bet-

the half-fascist government which they wanted to be more 
fascist, doesn’t the child therapist Bettelheim look at the 
faces of the children? One can proudly see the difference 
between the teutsche students and today’s rebellious boys 
and girls in this country, in France, and, yes, in Germany, 
simply by looking at their faces. What Dr. Bettelheim says 
is an insult — at least an insult to the intelligence of his 
readers.* 
Just as false, of course, is the “radical” rationalization 
that today’s American government is equal to Fascism — 
an argument which might “constitutionally” help to justify 
“Anarchist cooking.” The irony is that William Kunstler 
uses basically the same analogy to Germany as Irving 
Howe does, only for divergent reasons. 
Though also ignoring the parliament, Nixon is not a 
Hitler and not even a Hindenburg. Only as a joke one 
could make an analogy, since there are so many Sauer- 
kraut-names in the Nixon entourage. And, to facetiously 
stretch the analogy further, one might say that the “decent” 
conservative Nazi supporters tried to persuade Hitler to 
curb the offensive tone of his “African” (Goebbels), as the 
good Americans wish Nixon would do with his “Greek,” 
but here the analogy really ends. 
Rather, Richard M. Nixon is — cum grano salts — a Czar 
Nicolas II, and Attorney General John Mitchell is his 
Plehve.** 
What went on in Kent, Ohio, and elsewhere is a small 
Nazi regime was Papen's “backlash” against the Social Democratic 
government in Prussia, which capitulated to this illegal act, although 
the Social Democrats not only had organized labor behind them, but 
also the Prussian police force. The next and final “backlash” by the 
Nazis was caused by the readiness of the leadership of the German 
trade unions to put themselves at the service of the Nazi-Arbeits- 
front. Thus, if the Nazi regime was a “backlash,” then it came not as 
a move against revolutionary activities. Rather, it clearly resulted 
from the impotence of the liberals who were afraid of a “back- 
lash.” Such an attitude of course, directly led to the erosion of all 
the power the German liberals had. 
* The percentage of the students within the whole Nazi movement 
before 1933 was minute. Symptomatically, the bulk of the Nazi stu- 
dents were law students preparing themselves for administrative and 
judicial posts in the government— thus the real law-and-order people. 
Many of them would have gone to officers’ schools, but there were 
none in the Weimar Republic, and the regular army was restricted 
by peace treaty to 100.000 men. That sociologists and historians can 
neglect such important differences is hard to believe. 
** Tom Wicker in the A>»- York Times compares Mitchell with 
Rasputin. He is, of course, mistaken. Rasputin was not a member 
of the Czarist government and became prominent years after the 
1905 Revolution. Rather, Billy Graham is Nixon’s Rasputin. Never- 
theless. Wicker’s remark is discerning, because it draws attention to 
similarities between Nixon and Czar Nicolas II. 
but true copy of Bloody Sunday in January, 1905, when 
the guards “felt threatened” by the petitioners led by the 
priest Gapon (who, it was revealed a year later, was in the 
service of the Russian police). At that time, all-mighty 
Czarist Russia was involved in a bitter and costly and hope- 
less war with a second-rate, little, aggressive Asian coun- 
try; it was bothered by racial and minorities’ demands, by 
stone-throwing bearded students, by bomb-fabricating 
boys and girls from good and even aristocratic families. 
Plenty of dope was used, also (not only by rebellious stu- 
dents who, as today, did not get drunk as did their fathers). 
The list of striking similarities could be much extended. 
The “backlash” reaction to “Anarchist cooking” in Rus- 
sia was not from S.S. and S.A. Storm Troopers or Fascisti, 
but such well-established income-earning people as today’s 
construction workers. In old Russia, it was especially the 
poultry traders who broke up student meetings, while the 
police looked on. Those were the most active Jew-beaters 
also, because of the competition at the open street mar- 
kets. After all, the hard-hats feel threatened by Negro de- 
mands for job opportunities. That these construction work- 
ers will become the nuclei comparable to the “Black Hun- 
dreds” in Russia I doubt very much. They are not the Ku 
Klux Klan type, of which this country has plenty, to be re- 
cruited for “White Hundreds” — even at the universities. 
On the other hand, there were many Hickels in the 
Russian government and among the nobility, who pleaded 
for “understanding” of the rebellious students and their 
causes, and criticized the educational system. ‘..Millionaires 
gave money to the revolutionaries. The great opera singer 
Chaliapin arranged parties to collect for the imprisoned 
“Panthers” of that time. And also an impetuous women’s 
liberation movement appeared.** 
It is hard to leave this historical “necromancy” because it 
is, besides amusing, very helpful in analyzing the present 
political situation and its probable perspective. It is amus- 
ing to observe the way in which Nixon “hawks and spits 
(if a phrase by Schiller may be used) like Nicolas II. The 
Czar was also a great friend of peace conferences, and this 
especially used to enrage old Tolstoy. It was the Same 
Czar who initiated the World Court of Justice in The 
Hague. And Nixon now tries to do in reverse what Nicolas 
II did by getting an American president to settle his war 
in Asia in 1905. (Why not? The Russians are our oldest 
“imperial friends.” They were called that a long time ago 
when we engaged them as umpire to get back our slaves 
according to the terms of the Treaty of 1783.) 
What wonderful “generation of peace” this could be if 
only Czar Nixon and President Kosygin would get together 
* See Lenin’s works, English edition, vol. 7. Excellent for the 
description of the student movements and their potencies; it offers 
some interesting analogies.to today’s events at the universities. 
** The women’s liberation movement was a serious aspect ol the 
Russian Revolution. Its achievements in the first five years after the

and continue where their counterparts Eisenhower and 
Khrushchev left off because of the damned U -2 incident! 
This was a time when the Anarchist Bertrand Russell was 
,80 frightened by the nightmare of Russian-American co- 
operation (just as frightened as Tolstoy was when he 
learned that the visiting Czarist fleet in Nantes played the 
“Marseillaise” and the republican French navy of Liberte, 
Egalite, and Fratemite responded with “Long Live the 
Czar”) that he expressed the crazy wish that the Pentagon 
should throw atom bombs on the Kremlin. 
History proves that it is not the antagonism which leads 
to wars, but paradoxically the modus vivendi, when, to 
paraphrase Heinrich Heine, they will both understand each 
other and promptly find themselves in the mud. (Bismarck 
and Louis Bonaparte, so also Stalin and Hitler.) 
Moscow does not have to worry any more about NATO 
(if it ever seriously did ) . The drag on European economy 
by the American “stagflation” makes it probable that the 
successor of Willy Brandt may throw the American army 
out of Western Europe if the Federal Reserve should resist 
the return of the gold bullions (instead of paper dollars) 
it owes Germany. But what worries Moscow is the coming 
crisis of world economy; that might make the Kremlin’s 
readiness for “co-existence” more palatable and stop its 
support of “anti-imperialist forces.” Stalin’s policy of “So- 
cialism in one country” by exploiting the fellow-travelers of 
the Communist parties and national revolutionary move- 
ments in the world was in general very successful. To- 
day, the Kremlin still keeps to this very profitable policy. 
To give up that policy — as was partially done during the 
Roosevelt-Stalin honeymoon — would require that Ameri- 
can capital is ready to pay for it and to give much -better 
trade conditions than Western Europe and Japan. Soviet 
Russia has a very substantial reason, one can call it an “im- ' 
perialist” reason, for supporting the Arabs, the Vietcong, 
and Cuba — and to that degree Russia is a true ally of the 
revolutionary world. (Somehow similar to Napoleon’s revo- 
lutionary role in Europe.) The trade figures for the last 
decade speak a clear language: The substantial surpluses 
that Russia earns from trade with the so-called developing 
countries cover its trade deficit with the Western industrial 
suppliers. Of course, there might arise the great problem of 
indebtedness, which the “aid” given so graciously by Russia 
creates, with all its eventual consequences — like Western 
revolution were more progressive than anywhere else in the world. 
It is interesting that such a good observer as Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., 
prognosticates that today’s Women’s Lib movement will have a 
greater revolutionary impact than that of the “kids.” 
As expressed by the best-selling book Sexual Politics, the basic 
theories of the new movement are not any longer the liberal ones, 
but the revolutionary opinions of Friedrich Engels’ Origin of the 
Family. Author Kate Millett rightly criticizes the liberal and “free” 
sex literature of Norman Mailer and Henry Miller. Our objection 
is only that, by reproducing extensively the cheap filth, she seems to 
have fallen for the same old tricks as have other “unhurried viewers 
of Erotica.” 
“aid” already does, especially in South America where con- 
stant coup d’etats are partially motivated by the desire to 
get rid of the indebtedness to the Chase Manhattan and by 
the same token to get new “aid” from the First National, or 
else from Russia. 
The Smart Alecs at the New York Times advise Nixon 
to make use of the existing conflict between China and Rus- 
sia to get out of Vietnam. The conflict between China and 
Russia really exists, but it is naive to think that Peking 
and Moscow do not know what Washington wants. There 
is no doubt that Stalin was a neurotic and therefore he did 
it in his peculiar way, but his pact with Hitler threw off 
the Daladiers and Chamberlains, who wished that the 
Nazis would go against Russia and gain enough Lebens- 
raum that France and England would be spared. And it is 
just because of the conflict between themselves that Russia 
and China desire that Nixon stay as long as he can in Viet- 
nam, and go deeper and deeper into Cambodia, Laos, Thai- 
land, Burma, and, if possible, again into Korea. 
Nixon wants to get out of Vietnam; one can believe him. 
(It is anyway not the “right” war as Korea was, and not 
as “popular” as, for example, an invasion in the Near East 
could be.) It is not the war Congress does not like (the 
Tonkin resolution was almost unanimous), but the un- 
popularity of the war in Vietnam. Nixon is right when he 
says that ending the war in Vietnam would not stop the 
student movement and solve the decisive internal problems. 
The internal policy of a big power is never dependent on 
its foreign policy. Rather, it is the reverse. Otherwise rev- 
olutionaries would wish nothing better than wars. It is not 
true that wars are the fathers of revolutions. Rosa Luxem- 
burg and Lenin thought at the outbreak of the First World 
War that the chances of proletarian revolution were de- 
layed and not progressed, and that the war brutalities would 
destroy the international spirit of the proletariat. What 
revolution resulted directly from the Second World war? 
Not even Stalin could say that the invasions by the Red 
Army were revolutions. But it is true that wars, even vic- 
torious ones, often add decisively to internal difficulties 
and therefore ultimately may lead to revolution. 
Wars break out for economic reasons. We are told that 
the war in Vietnam damages the economy. Yes, but whose 
economy? Adam Smith argued correctly that slavery is un- 
rentable, while he must have seen how Liverpool flourished 
as the mecca of the international slave trade. George 
Washington, the biggest slaveholder in Virginia, used to 
complain bitterly that he lost money on slaves. At the 
same time, he bought new ones (secretly, so that his good 
northern friends should not know). It is true that Wall 
Street protested strongly against the Cambodia invasion, 
and it is known as a historical fact that every time a war 
starts the stock market goes down, while peace or peace 
rumors usually bring the shares up. 
We are told that economically the United States did not 
ANARCHISM TODAY 
17 
win World War II, especially because of U.S. generosity in 
foreign aid and because the losers (Germany and Japan) 
are prosperous. Never mind that the bulk of our aid con- 
sists of armament which is not productive. Only one look 
at the list of American investments in Europe and at the 
interest obligations of the so-called undeveloped countries 
suffices to show that imperialism pays. Ford’s newly nego- 
tiated participation at the automobile factory in — what 
irony! — Hiroshima alone will pay off more than the cost 
of the first atom bomb which was thrown on this town. 
It is true that the military has its own interest, and so 
has every other branch of the ruling class — the banks, the 
insurance companies, the agrarian conglomerates etc., etc. 
The special interest of the military is a pretty old one, older 
than capitalism. Campanella nearly four hundred years 
ago complained that the Spanish commanders prolonged 
the war so that their pay as well as their authority might 
also be prolonged.* There is no need for the special term 
“military industrial complex,” since Imperialism character- 
izes sufficiently the stage of capitalism in which we live. 
The military does not live in a vacuum. No doubt, 
American capitalism can exist without South America, 
without Arabian oil, and even without investments in 
Europe, though those alone are a greater investment than 
the British Empire ever had. But when those “third per- 
sons” (as Lenin called them) are once available, capital 
necessarily is somehow driven to exploit them and to swal- 
low up the surplus profit the “help”-needing countries 
provide. About one quarter of India’s, Brazil’s, Argentina’s, 
and Mexico’s exports go for covering of the interest debts 
on foreign loans. This is the economic explanation for impe- 
rialism and war. 
The economic difficulties of American capitalism were 
not created by the Vietnam war. In capitalism industry 
produces commodities, no matter whether industry is ap- 
plied to production or destruction of things. True, military 
production does not create wealth. Neither does adver- 
tising. It is waste, overhead, misused capacities, and loafing 
that characterize cooperative capitalism, so that any wage 
demands threaten the rate of surplus value toward capital’s 
point of no return so much that inflation becomes, in fact, 
the main source of profit. But profits are high. Look at the 
growth of American banking. Stopping the Vietnam war 
will not change inflation and improve employment. Ache- 
son, the protagonist of the Pentagon, is right that it does 
not mean much if all that the U.S. military spends is hard- 
ly seven percent of a national growth amounting to a tril- 
lion! 
All governments shed crocodile tears about inflation. 
Even the Thieu gang does it, while sucking dry the Ameri- 
cans with black-market operations. Who else but govern- 
* General Douglas MacArthur became seriously worried that the 
invention of atomic weapons, and thus wars of very short duration, 
might shake the whole idea of the military. 
ments create inflation? There are no private money-print- 
ing presses. It is a pretext that welfare and education are 
the real causes of inflation. American industry has reached 
such capacities and productivity that, even with very high 
wages, prices could go down instead of up. Inflation is eco- 
nomically nothing but a method of avoiding the commer- 
cial crisis which, under normal capitalism, usually ap- 
peared periodically after the growth of industry reached a 
certain high point. The practical social effect of inflation is 
the same as Depression and Recession, but with other 
means. The pockets of labor and the middle classes are 
emptied, while their nominal earnings even increase. Un- 
employment, a typical result of Depression, disappears, 
while pauperism is growing. (“It is estimated that each 
year a million people become poor,” says Columbia Pro- 
fessor Etzioni.) Surely inflation has its dangers and, like 
a Depression, it is threatening the existence of the capital- 
ist system. No wonder that every measure Nixon is taking 
(or pretending to take) to stop inflation brings about “nor- 
mal” depressing results: reduction of capital investments, 
a bear market, unemployment — all the symptoms of a 
regular economic crisis. 
Looking at the economic and social realities, there is no 
reason to believe that any other government could do 
better than Nixon’s — even if the computer could give the 
right answer — avoiding the catastrophe that Herbert Hoov- 
er did not foresee. Hoover kept saying, “Everything is so 
good.” What else should he have done? Suppose Hoover 
had known what all the economics professors (who 
claimed that American ingenuity had abolished the normal 
business cycle forever) did not know — that the 1929 
crash was coming? What nonsense to have expected him 
to tell the people to stop buying stock and to withdraw their 
bank deposits! What in all honesty should Nixon do now? 
The first solution of (at that time) “free enterprise” 
American capitalism to the Depression was the classical 
one: mass unemployment, low wages, pauperization. That 
is the normal capitalist solution, which Nixon would like 
and for which the new economics genius Milton Friedman 
invented a formula of “government interference by gov- 
ernment noninterference” (fits Nixon so nicely). One is 
reminded of the wizard of the German economy, Hjalmar 
Schacht, who was also strictly “free-enterprise” oriented, 
but managed the Weimar economy as well as Hitler’s. ( Le 
Monde, Paris, calls the Nixon economic policy “Fried- 
man’s paradox.”) 
There is always a way out for a capitalist economy as 
long as there is no revolution. In the heights of the De- 
pression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the val- 
ue of the dollar by the rate of 40 percent (a drastic infla- 
tion) and introduced Social Security and public works, 
thus government interference. Still the Depression was 
practically holding on till American business got the big 
push caused by the outbreak of the Second World War. By 
18 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
“giving-in” to labor and farmer, Roosevelt succeeded in 
ameliorating the Depression and avoiding the revolution- 
ary consequences of capitalist crises. 
It is not possible to foresee the solution of today’s Re- 
cession. But it seems probable that Nixon will “give-in.” 
That will mean — as paradoxical as it sounds — more infla- 
tion and more taxation, higher interest rates and increased 
money liquidity, with all of which labor and big business 
can be neutralized. Or will he continue to follow the Fried- 
man-paradox which claims that a big unemployment now 
will avoid a bigger unemployment later? 
Nixon is in trouble. The present economy has made a 
"shambles of the impressive computer-built “econometric” 
forecasts which were made for 1969. Still we have fore- 
casts for the seventies with doubling and tripling of produc- 
tion (for the computer industry tenfold, I believe). The in- 
teresting thing is that, if the analysts would not predict 
these tremendous amounts of growth, they logically would 
have to prognose crisis. 
The trouble Nixon faces is economic and quite normal, 
conditioned by the capitalist system in its imperialist stage. 
The situation parallels that of the British Empire, whose 
role has now been assumed by the United States. The 
British also used to invade the so-called undeveloped coun- 
tries “solely” to protect lives and “to get our citizens out.” 
To prove his theory of imperialism, Lenin quoted Cecil 
Rhodes, the main initiator of the Boer War who, as early 
as 1895, said: “If you don’t want civil war, you have to 
become imperialists.” 
Like any other phenomenon of capitalist economy, 
which is solely motivated by divergent and competitive in- 
terests, imperialism has its contradictions. Only in the night 
do all cats look gray. The closing of the Suez Canal has 
hurt, but the owners of the big tankers, which could not 
use this shorter route anyway, now get the business. 
Nixon, whose Republican Party traditionally has been 
for tariffs, now fights the protective measures which the 
Democratic-controlled Senate passed in the interest of the 
shoe and textile industries. High or low interest rates, in- 
flation or price and wage controls, taxation or spending re- 
duction are claimed to be principles. They are only inter- 
ests, because a simple principle of economics is: What one 
loses another gains. Even in a bear market, every stock 
that is sold has a buyer. 
Wall Street felt angry about Cambodia — but the real 
reason for the bear market is not Nixon’s blundering in 
Cambodia. Ask any businessman, and he will always blame 
bad business on politics. While the government made infla- 
tion (which is always a swindle because the additional 
money supply does not really represent the volume of actu- 
al capital growth), the bull market was Wall Street’s pri- 
vate inflation. Theoretically the average price of shares 
should be determined by the balance of activities — that is, 
by the earnings, like prices of any other commodities oscil- 
lating around their real value. The bull market went 
much further than was justified by real growth plus infla- 
tion. The shares went much higher than the earnings and 
potentials of the companies allowed. They even went up 
for stocks of companies which were bankrupt or near bank- 
ruptcy like Penn Central, Lockheed, and Chrysler. It is 
“normal” today that many companies are paying prevailing 
interest rates of 10 percent while earning only 6 to 8 per- 
cent of their investment. 
In addition to the blunders within the American econ- 
omy, there is a crisis in the international capital market, 
where the U.S. dollar plays a dominant role, with inflation- 
ary effects. McNamara, who learned at the Pentagon that 
disagreeable events often repeat themselves, is now as 
president of the World Bank busy avoiding a new attack 
on the gold swindle of the Federal Reserve. An American 
Depression will undoubtedly drag in the European and 
Japanese economies which already are suffering under 
their own inflations. An international collapse is in the 
making, but when it will come and what form it will take 
depends on so many imponderables that nothing can be pre- 
dicted about it. A world economic crisis will surely make 
acute the situation which already bears a revolutionary 
character. But permanent crises do not exist. There is al- 
ways an escape hatch. 
All governments are interested in avoiding economic 
crises, even such with a “principle of noninterference” 
(which is itself a contradiction and no principle at all). 
Nixon is trying very hard to prevent the Depression which 
has been threatening since he came to Washington. Nixon 
truly represents the interests of avoiding bad business in 
general, and he would like to represent the economic inter- 
est of the silent majority, if possible. However, the intricacy 
of the matter is that capitalism is a competitive system and 
acutely so in depressive situations, when the whole pie gets 
smaller. And since what one gains the other loses, govern- 
ment interference becomes increasingly directed by the 
most powerful interest groups. What follows is usually that 
the interests of the silent majority are neglected and even 
antagonized. Additionally, all governments have Bona- 
partistic tendencies and often follow their own interests, 
as constantly increasing its own financial power, which 
might temporarily conflict with pure economics. 
Obviously, in the face of the vast complexity of world 
political and economic affairs, it is impossible to predict 
when a revolution may occur. 
The students are told that the time is not ripe. Ripe 
for what? If the actual revolution is meant, then even the 
great master of revolution, Lenin, did not prognosticate the 
revolution in 1905 until it really happened. A few weeks 
before the February revolution, in a speech to Swiss stu- 
dents, he told them it would be them, not him, who would 
live in the time of the coming revolution. The character of 
a revolution implies its timely indefiniteness. Eldridge

Cleaver’s perspective of a right-wing coup d'etat in the 
United States by 1972 which will trigger a mass eruption 
with the revolution victorious in the end sounds fine, but 
it reminds one too much of the 1932-33 Stalinite Comin- 
tern policy that “after Hitler come we.” “It has to get worse 
before it can get better,” is a banality. “The dawn of the 
morning does not appear again until the darkness of the 
night has completely broken” sounds like a Greek classic, 
but it is not a revolutionary thought. Sure, the Stalinites 
were “right” and it is true that they came after Hitler, but 
how and to what? “Perspectives” like the one by Cleaver 
lead only to illusions. 
Anarchists have no “perspective.” Mao had no “per- 
spective.” As he described it to Malraux, even if the rev- 
olution, which came as a “ripe fruit,” had not come at 
all, the “long march” by itself had tremendous value: in 
the education of the masses, in developing the farms, in 
constantly breaking the power of the enemy.* 
Nobody can know how the revolution in America will 
come about. Impressed by the Emancipation war and Re- 
construction period, even Marx thought about the prob- 
ability of a peaceful (by-election-achievable) revolution in 
this country. He did not live long enough to see that all 
tendencies which he described in the theoretical analyses 
of “Capital,” especially the one leading to monopolism and 
corruption, would, beginning with the 80’s find their exces- 
sive and brutal triumph here, more than anywhere in the 
world. 
American historians always avoided raising the ques- 
tion of what a conviction of President Andrew Johnson 
by the Senate after the impeachment by the House would 
have led to. Only one vote more for the constitutional two 
thirds required for removal and Reconstruction would have 
been the revolution the Anarchists Thoreau, Parker, Emer- 
son, Phillips and Garrison were longing for! 
All we can know of the near future is that the riots will 
multiply — the riots on the campuses, in the ghettos, in 
the jails; people will burn their apartments to get rid of 
the bedbugs, set fire to the garbage on the streets because 
the Sanitation Department cannot cope with the waste of 
affluence; the cops who are already more afraid than the 
people they are supposed to protect will be more scared 
to walk alone in the streets; people will put more iron bars 
and locks on the doors and windows of their homes. Who 
knows where the riots will break out next: in the high 
schools, in the plants, in the armed forces? By squatting 
* In Man's Fate, the greatest novel of our time illustrating the 
realities of the revolutionary movement, Malraux provides a 
masterly description of the relationship between Anarchists and 
Marxists in China. Significantly, it is Ch'en, the Anarchist, with 
whom this novel starts. Later, in his talk with Malraux, Mao empha- 
sizes that the revolution took power while Hankow, the most in- 
dustrialized city in all China, was quaeL Mao did not even properly

against speculating landlords, by jumping the subway turn- 
stiles, by beating up dope pushers, by looting stores as the 
symbols of price inflation, by sit-ins as answer to un- 
employment and in support of wildcat strikes, by directing 
doctors in hospitals and teachers in schools to do what 
the people want them to do or get out, by wrecking draft 
boards and military installations, etc. etc., people will take 
their fate in their own hands. All such “Anarchist Cook- 
ing” represents good American tradition. “Anarchist Cook- 
ing” and self-protection are taught to American children by 
the Western movies.

Who are these revolutionary students? What do they 
want? And whom do they serve? 
It is a lot of fun to see the play about Marat with the 
long-winded title, which reveals to us the great wisdom 
that the whole world is crazy. We learn that, because the 
People’s Friend was irritated by a skin disease, he 
bloodily called for heads. Thus, Kropotkin’s and others’ 
efforts to find the reasons for and explain the terrorism of 
the French Revolution — which symbolized more than any 
other in history the eternal contrast between the goal of 
humanity and the means of violence — were in vain, since 
it is so simple. That Marat wrote his Philosophy of Man, 
wherein he proclaimed an extreme materialism almost 
twenty years before the Revolution even began, and that 
he vented his hatred not only against the king but also 
against Liberals like Voltaire, Mirabeau, and Lafayette, 
and therefore had to go into hiding in the sewers of Paris, 
where he contracted the disease, seems not to be relevant. 
The play is the thing! 
A growing body of literature tries to explain the spread- 
ing of violence and drug addiction in our present society 
from the psychological viewpoint. And it is a fact that to 
hardly any other expression of human behavior can the 
fashionable term “Oedipus Complex,” “Castration Anxi- 
ety,” “Libido,” “Aggression,” “Rejection,” etc., etc., be so 
impressively applied as to revolutionary movements and 
their protagonists. But even when this is done by serious 
analysts, such explanations often lead to silliness. For ex- 
ample, four decades ago Wilhelm Reich, who with Otto 
Fenichel was among the first politically oriented Freud- 
ians,* came out with the most simple explanation for fas- 
cism, namely, “lack of a healthy orgasm.” 
* Freud considered himself apolitical. He was very conservative 
until his later years, when his friendship with Romain Rolland 
began. In his letters, Freud clearly expressed sympathy toward the 
Kaiser and for Hindenburg’s war successes (in which he believed 
up to the very end). 
20 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
On a similar level, psychologists today are taking part 
in commissions set up by Nixon and Lindsay to explain the 
causes of addiction, violence, and crime among youth; and 
just as simple are the corrective gadgets these commissions 
propose. 
We know that Anarchism is antiauthoritarian (a state- 
ment which is hardly more than a tautology). Hence it 
seems that Anarchists are like adolescents. They are — we 
are told — rebelling against the authority of government 
as young people do against the authority of the father. The 
comparison of the family with the state, though it has a cer- 
tain historical juncture, cannot be taken seriously. But, for 
reasons of clarify ing what Anarchism really is, let’s deal with 
the analytic vulgarism which says that all these young 
people want is to do what their fathers are doing. Those 
bums do not want to go to school; and therefore they at- 
tack the educational system. They want to sleep with their 
mothers; therefore they kill their fathers. They want to be 
seductive and to addict themselves; their fathers talk big, 
get drunk, and become violent. If Father Nixon is allowed 
to play with B-52s in the Far and Near East, they see 
nothing wrong with planting a bomb in a department store. 
They also seem to subscribe to juridical logic: If surface 
atomic tests are outlawed, let’s go underground. . . . 
Such simplified psychoanalytic nonsense, which reduces 
the predestined disharmony of the state to seemingly the 
same for the family tends ad absurdum. The conservative, 
the liberal, and the status-quo solutions to the problem are: 
Agnew is for more spanking, Hickel for more love, and 
Nixon (by custom required to be the responsible father), 
for both. 
The undoubtedly skillful handling of wayward and ag- 
gressive youngsters by August Aichhorn cannot be applied 
to today’s student revolts. By disregarding the decisive 
political and ideological character of youth movements all 
over the world, valuable psychoanalytic observations on 
delinquency become psychological crap. 
This is not to say that a serious psychological approach 
does not have its merits. After all, those rebellious boys 
and girls are human. They are very human indeed. In a 
highly interesting, recently published book (In the Service 
of Their Country: War Resisters in Prison ) Dr. Willard 
Gaylin, a practicing analyst and professor of psychology 
at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and at Union 
Theological Seminary, supplies analytical case studies of 
nonviolent draft resisters. He shows how it is the treatment 
by the government as well as the experiences with the penal 
system which change their emotions and thoughts into real 
revolutionary ones. Especially interesting is what Dr. Gay- 
lin has to say about the reaction of his analyst colleagues, 
to whom he tried to transmit the results of his knowledge, 
efforts, and time: “They [the students | are masochists”; 
"they have deep-rooted guilt”; “they are psychotic. . . .” 
There is undoubtedly a gap between the generations, ex- 
pressed by different behavior from that which goes on in 
daily life. For example, a report by the Internal Revenue 
Service says that more than one out of every three Ameri- 
can doctors appears now to be cheating on his income tax. 
While the affluent doctor is thus in constant fear of the 
government authorities, his sons and daughters are also 
affected, but in a peculiar way. The parent taught them not 
to cheat, and that this government is a sublime one. The 
father actually has good reasons for approving the govern- 
ment, one reason being that it gives him all the political 
freedom he wants, as well as the best freedom a liberal 
bureaucratic system can offer, namely the possibility of 
cheating. His children are less “objective” toward the state 
that threatens their father. They also have other and better 
reasons to become antagonistic to the father than that he 
sleeps with the mother: They are experiencing the hypoc- 
risy and immorality of that father. They often see him in 
his so highly ethical profession put money interests above 
the interests of his patients “because,” they hear him say, 
“I want to give my children a good education.” (The 
morale of the son is not enhanced by his feeling imprisoned 
in college because of a 2-S draft classification.) Numerous 
examples like this can be cited, especially from the daily 
life in affluent circles of our society where many of the stu- 
dents in revolt come from. The “gap” is there and incom- 
parable to the usual one between fathers and sons. 
But what is socially redeeming about this conflict be- 
tween father and son is that in general the strong human 
quality of mutual respect between father and son proves 
strongest and the idealism of the young is forced upon the 
old generation. 
The point is this: the psychological makeup of individu- 
als is not the determinant of real social movement. Even 
the most deep rooted customs and forms of relationships 
are steamrollered by participation of individuals in mass 
movements, which cannot wait on neuroses and complexes 
and which contrary to being based on the common psy- 
chological makeup of many in fact transcends such as a 
basis for unity or disunity, as a basis for action. It would 
seem that if anyone is hung up on unresolved problems 
of adolescence it is these same people who can only under- 
stand others in these terms. These are the alienated ones. 
Why is it especially the student rather than youth in 
general? It is because the intellectually (and often also 
pecuniarily) privileged student, as any talented individual, 
develops an urge to communicate his knowledge and other 
gifts to the less privileged, to the poor, to the Blacks. This is 
a living process of learning in itself, far superior to any that 
formal education can offer. This urge will lead the fine 
mind to recognition of and involvement with others, an 
involvement which, if successful, will go beyond the narrow 
intellectual frame and become the real life. It was so with 
the students of the 1840’s when, to meet the demands of 
industrial development, mass education started. It was so 
ANARCHISM TODAY 
21 
before 1905 in Russia. And it is so with much greater 
quantitative and qualitative force now all over the world 
(very much also in the developing countries). Innumer- 
able stories are told that during the strict Black Laws in the 
South, daughters and wives of slave holders had that moti- 
vation which knowledge usually awakens, and taught 
Negroes to read and write. Again those girls and women 
were often led, at great risk to themselves, to more mani- 
fest breaches of law and order when they supported the 
Underground Railroad. 
It is often such involvement which shakes illusions about 
the established order — about the state, about religion, 
about conventional habits, among them especially sex and 
race prejudices. Contesting illusions leads to radicalism. 
To become radical — to question the existing system at its 
roots — requires a certain degree of consciousness. It is the 
same process of consciousness which Lenin’s theory of 
class consciousness expected of the revolutionary worker: 
He reasoned that, through involvement in demands for 
pennies and other Sisyphean improvements which the 
masses raise naturally, the worker becomes conscious of 
the contradiction that the real producer is not the owner of 
his product, that the illusory and inhuman commodity re- 
lationships among men are conditioned by the political 
power of the state, and that therefore taking control of 
social production will mean Socialism. 
No wonder that, as the degree of consciousness which 
leads to radicalization increases, students become more and 
more the real enemies of Liberalism, and vice versa. Liber- 
alism is based on principles. Radicalism is based on con- 
sciousness and has no principles. Political Liberalism is 
based on the principle of majority rule — a wonderful prin- 
ciple, no doubt, but illusionary, since the majority can 
only be achieved by power. (In democracies, it is also the 
power of illusion and of organization which creates major- 
ities.) Baffled by the fact that Hitler, together with re- 
actionary splinter groups, actually had the majority before 
Hitler took over the government, German Liberalism 
either had to stick to its principle and accept Hitler (which 
in the beginning it did) or to give up its principle, fight him 
illegally, and even to propagandize war against him (which 
at the end it also did). (That Hitler started that war is in 
this context irrelevant.) 
Radicalism cannot respect Voltaire’s principle to fight 
with all his power for the right of his adversary to express 
his opinion — it is a falsehood, and was used by Voltaire for 
opportunistic reasons. 
To demonstrate the practical consequences of Liberal- 
ism for the actual example of fighting the war in Vietnam, 
let us for a 'moment consider the conflict between the two 
branches of Republican government: The Liberals contest 
the right of the president to make war without the consent 
of the Senate. But to defend that constitutional principle 
(which is circumvented anyway by the argument that this 
is not a “war” but only an “action” to save the lives of our 
soldiers) in the face of an existing law passed by Congress 
that the president has the autonomous right, without ask- 
ing anybody and when only he feels it necessary, to press 
the button to atomic holocaust, is a blatant absurdity. 
There is for the Liberal senators the legitimate parlia- 
mentary method of filibustering to prevent the continua- 
tion of the Vietnam War. This could be effected by far few- 
er than the some forty Senators who claim to be for im- 
mediate withdrawal. But the principle of Liberalism is 
against filibustering, although it is perfectly legal. 
When the government finally allowed the impressive 
anti-war demonstrations and even “gave-in” to some dis- 
turbances, although the government had the legal right to 
suppress them violently. Liberalism was stuck with the 
dilemma: “What do we do next?” Another peaceful dem- 
onstration, which would play on the nerves of the govern- 
ment as well as the nerves of the demonstrators? One of 
the answers was given by the nervous guards in Kent, Ohio. 
Such an answer, given by the government when it feels it 
cannot “give-in,” creates a revolutionary situation and thus 
the challenge for which radicalism consciously and admit- 
tedly is waiting (as happened in one of the best examples 
in history, 1905 in Russia). Exactly the same kind of an- 
swer is given by radicalism — one might call it Marxism, 
Anarchism, or whatever. Radicalism by its very definition 
is always provoking the establishment with the clear intent 
of creating a revolutionary situation (as happened in 1917 
in Russia). 
At the beginning of this process, which in the end looks 
like the natural catastrophe of an avalanche (though in 
fact it never comes by “itself”), there is always the ten- 
dency of a seemingly similar interest between the establish- 
ment and its radical adversary. This “mutuality” of inter- 
est finds its most practical expression at the beginning of 
the process, and very often also occurs when the revolu- 
tionary process decays. A “mutual” interest among the 
voluntaristic arms of government and of radicalism, name- 
ly the police and the Anarchists. 
Anarchist cooking contributes to the disrupting and 
weakening of the establishment. It is a response to the 
realities of the existing social forces and their legal institu- 
tions. It is also a response to the realities brought about by 
the alienation, with its accompanying illusions, phantasies, 
confusions, and its isolation from the real world. It re- 
sponds to these as self-defense, but in its practical effect it 
could seem to be an invention of the police. The “cooking” 
is mostly done by confused (in fact, unpolitical) desper- 
adoes with good ideas and intentions, and from good fami- 
lies, and by criminal neurotics who want to take from the 
rich and give to the poor. But soon the police — also in- 
terested in disruption, which is after all their raison d’etre — 
make use of Anarchist cooking. One method is to use the 
very same people who get caught whom the police get in 
22 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
the squeeze, as they still believe that they can dupe the 
police and achieve their aim — disruption of society. Classic 
is the case of the famous spy Azov who, with Savincoff, was 
leader of the terrorist wing of the Russian Social Revolu- 
tionaries. For a long time Azov successfully arranged most 
of the terrorist acts against the Czarist government with 
the direct help of the Okhrana (the Czarist FBI). His- 
torians are still in dispute as to whether these secret police 
manipulations damaged or helped the revolutionary cause 
in Russia. 
This system of agent provocateurism is nowhere so 
much in practice as in the United States, supported by the 
unique legal institution which lets a “state’s witness” 
(though an active participant and even the initiator of the 
crime) go free. The American Communist Party was al- 
ways infiltrated by the FBI, in some localities to such an 
extent that without this infiltration the CP would hardly 
have had any members. It is well known that presently the 
FBI and state and local policemen appear as Hippies with 
long hair, smoke pot, etc. In many countries a spy is con- 
sidered even among conservative people the lowest wretch 
of society. In Pilsudski-Poland, it once happened that the 
man who killed an infiltrator into the illegal Communist 
Party was acquitted by a judge, who asked: “What else 
could they have done to such scum?” 
There is hardly a police department of any American 
city today which does not hire and train agents who are 
supposed to live and behave as hippies among hippies. 
They grow beards and long hair, and, since they have one 
of the best available sources of dope and any kind of wea- 
pons, they easily become influential within Anarchist 
circles. 
The natural emotional reaction to discovering a spy or 
agent provocateur is to kill him — more so when he was a 
trusted friend — as a punishment and revenge. But there is 
not only the emotional side to it, which has an individual- 
istic character, the punishment becomes a political and 
organizational question. Killing a spy seems to be the only 
way to save the organization, but it also puts the organiza- 
tion in jeopardy. 
In many cases where assassination and bombing had 
considerable political after-effects, history could never as- 
certain whether these terrorist acts were committed by 
desperate radicals or by government agents. Character- 
istically even the best and most thorough investigations 
could not solve this riddle. And in most of these cases of 
“Anarchist cooking,” the established government was the 
gainer. We still do not know if Goering or the demented 
Dutch Anarchist Van der Lubbe set fire to the Reichstag, 
which triggered the Nazi terror. We still do not know if it 
was Mussolini who hired the Croatian terrorist to assassi- 
nate Alexander of Yugoslavia and Barthou, who as a man of 
letters was pleading for Liberalism in the Balkans. We 
still do not know if Stalin organized the killing of Kirov, 
following which the novelty occurred that Bolsheviks were 
not only fired from their positions but executed en masse. 
Khrushchev in his four-hour-long speech about Stalin’s 
crimes was silent about the killing of Kirov, who was con- 
sidered the most conciliatory among the Stalinists. And 
last but not least, we still do not know who killed Presi- 
dent Kennedy, of whom it was said that he had just plan- 
ned to recognize Castro’s Cuba. (That does not conflict with 
the fact that President Kennedy discussed with the Senator 
from Florida a plan to have Castro assassinated. ) 
Who was really behind the killing of Malcolm X, who 
had just achieved for himself a radical orientation similar 
to the Panthers? Who financed the killing of Martin Luther 
King, Jr., who, as is now known, intended to ignore the 
FBI threat to release telephone buggings which would al- 
legedly show his “immorality,” if he were to give up his 
policy of nonviolence? 
It was this dilemma inherent in individual terrorism — 
and never theoretical or political differences — which moti- 
vated Marx to dissociate himself from the French Blan- 
quists (he always adored the courageous Blanqui) and to 
break abruptly with the “World Society of Revolutionary 
Communists.” It was also only the Nihilist machinations 
of Netshayev that made him break with Bakunin and led 
to the de facto liquidation of the First International. 
Since the attitude of Marxism toward “Anarchist cook- 
ing” plays such an important role in the heads of radicals, 
I believe it necessary to add here a corrective picture of 
Marx and Engels as it was distorted by German Marxists. 
Marx and Engels always, from the beginning to the end 
of their political life, had great admiration for the Russian 
revolutionary activists. This was in clear contrast to their 
— often even personal — aversion toward their German fol- 
lowers, whose parliamentarian cretinism and revolution- 
ary sounding programs they detested. They approved 
unequivocally that the tactic of a “party of action at the 
moment in Russia should be to bring about such strong 
disturbances which could intimidate the ruler.” A report to 
Maria Oshanina, the leader of the conspiratorial “People’s 
Will,” about conversations with Marx and Engels (the 
authenticity of this report is confirmed by Engels’ ap- 
proval of its publication in 1893) leaves no doubt that 
Marx agreed to the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, 
which occurred on the same day the Czar signed a liberal 
constitution. Since Alexander II was a “liberal” Czar, who 
emancipated the serfs and introduced local self-govern- 
ment, the terror act undoubtedly served the reaction. Still 
Marx and Engels encouraged the Russian conspirators “to 
disturb as much as possible,” “to bring about un-order,” 
“to knock down the fatalistic power of inertia,” and “to 
shake society out of its indolence and immobility.” “World- 
ly wisdom” and “grand” were the words Marx used about 
ANARCHISM TODAY / 23 
the letter of the terrorists written to the new Czar announc- 
ing they would not kill him if he amnestied all political 
prisoners. 
Lenin’s older brother who as we know was already in- 
fluenced by Marxist literature hesitated to take part in the 
terrorist attempt against Alexander III, but finally he in- 
volved himself in it as the leading spirit and was executed.* 
It is silly to think that any revolutionary supposes “An- 
archist cooking” could get rid of the government. One of 
the oldest devices of the state is : “The King is dead — long 
live the King!” Even ten blowups similar to the one at the 
University of Wisconsin could not destroy the military re- 
search for the Pentagon. It can only express the degree of 
radicalization. This process of radicalization is not the 
same as Socialist propaganda. It is not a step to organiza- 
tion. “Anarchist cooking” is destruction. It does not 
“build.” It is not enlightenment through programs, opin- 
ions, and debates. It is real practical movement. Whoever 
is involved in it has radically broken with the rotten society 
of oppression, racism, war, and pollution. He is “out of it” 
as much as can be. “Anarchist cooks” do not build organi- 
zations. The campus, the neighborhood, and the street are 
their field. Any organization they could build by and for 
themselves would isolate them, as the tendency to isola- 
tion and sectarianism is always implied in radicalism. And, 
as we can see from the experiences at the campuses in the 
last years, their radicalism continues even when they get 
older — in contrast to the previous generation which kept 
switching in fellow traveling from Stalin to Roosevelt, from 
Castro to Kennedy, and back. 
What will “Anarchist cooking” achieve? If bluntly put 
or in the sense of the bombasting goals Socialist educators 
used to close their lectures with, the answer is: Nothing. 
Today’s rebellious youth are not bothered by the old ques- 
tion: Does the end justify the means? In fact, the end is 
already included in the means they use. These students do 
not break away and isolate themselves from society and 
from the family. On the contrary, they are very active — too 
active from the viewpoint of the establishment and their 
fathers. What they instantly achieve by their actions is 
liberation, the opposite of alienation. In using and tasting 
the “recipes,” the ioy is already there. It is a similar expe- 
rience to the ui the old-time class-conscious worker who 
liberated himself from the dullness and alienation of the 
factory treadmill by joining his organization, by being 
active, and even risking his life for it. This was already 
Socialism for him, as much as it is possible within this 
world around him; here he achieved real human freedom. 
His motivation was not to provide for his children “a 
* Lenin in the later years, describing his sharp fight against the 
Russian Anarchists before 1917, says: “Naturally, only for oppor- 
tunistic reasons (not for principled reasons) did we not approve of 
individual terror.” 
better world,” as the devout sisters of Socialist or Com- 
munist churches believe. 
“Anarchist cooking” can be as liberating to the student 
as participation in the Palestinian Liberation movement 
is to the Arab women who through it can for the first time 
rise up from the backwardness which has for centuries 
covered their faces and kept them home after 6 p.m. 
The Anarchist achieves “better living through chem- 
istry.” His is not a protest movement, as liberals would 
like it to be. Anarchists are not much interested in 
strengthening the legal opposition against war and poverty 
or perhaps transitions to an economy of peace, to “normal 
capitalism,” to a better education. Their aim is, indeed, dis- 
ruption, confusion, undermining, and destruction — the 
most realistic and adequate aim in a world of organized 
chaos. “Positive” critique and opposition would make 
them a part of this world. Anarchists are not politicians, 
they are realists. Only they really can identify the means 
they are using with the goal they want to achieve. Since 
they do not know where to go, every way is the right one. 
The construction of the future is not their thing. (It is dif- 
ferent with such movements as the Panthers, but even 
their strength evidently lies not in improving the lot of the 
poor Blacks, in “peace,” in “equal rights,” in “equal op- 
portunities,” in “desegregation” or “Black capitalism,” but 
lies in “Anarchist cooking,” which develops their personal 
dignity, holding their heads high as an answer to the 
drudgery into which not only birth but “benign neglect” 
forces them.) 
When, after the Second World War, the mainstream of 
revolution had shifted from highly industrialized countries 
to underdeveloped ones like the Congo, Guatemala, 
Algeria, there seemed for a very long time to be no 
“Marxian” (i.e., economic and social) basis for class 
struggle and Socialist revolution. In this vacuum, Herbert 
Marcuse in the best German philosophical tradition was 
the first who conceived a new Hegelian theory of the “Dia- 
lectic of Liberation,” a theory of “the Great Refusal” 
against the intellectual and sexual repression of modern 
industrial society. Marcuse, in combining Marx with Freud, 
became for a while the apostle of a new Anarchism 
(even Nihilism). 
The newest development of this “Great Refusal” after 
the events of May and June, 1968, in France expressed 
the trend to a new recognition of class struggle and there- 
fore the recognition of the role of the proletariat which, as 
the strongest link in the chain of exploitation, is where the 
break must come. Freed from his esoteric language, this 
meant — neVer mind sex, pot, and bombs — the return to 
Hegel and Marx. But is it? 
In an earlier day, the old Marxists and Leninists became 
impressed by the growing propaganda power of mass 
movement, and interpreted, constructed, and applied “re* I-

/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
istically” or “dialectically” the universal perception of 
human freedom, which is Negation of Negation. As they 
did so, they were immediately confronted with a demand 
to state the “Concrete alternative.” Today Herbert Marcuse, 
whose theories have gained new attention as a result of the 
impressive events of 1968 in France and the nearly univer- 
sal antiwar and antipollution movements in the United 
States, feels confronted with the same demand. The term 
concrete alternative came up at the Warsaw University, 
and was frequently used by legitimate Marxist professors 
after strict adherence to the party line was no longer de- 
manded. Politically, concrete alternative means for them 
nothing more than the return to the France-oriented Little 
Entente. This time the Entente would consist of Dubcek, 
Tito, and Ceausescu, as an alternative to Russia and Amer- 
ica.* 
Marcuse is a serious thinker and knows that all Utopians 
were authoritarian prophets who wanted to force their 
system on the people. Marcuse is moreover a man of 
integrity, not a politician, and agrees that “the demand is 
meaningless if it asks for a blueprint of the specific insti- 
tutions and relationships which would be those of the new 
society: they cannot be determined a priori." “However,” 
Marcuse says now, “the question cannot be brushed aside 
by saying that what matters today is the destruction of 1 
the old, of the powers that be, making way for the 
emergence of the new. Such an answer neglects the essen- 
tial fact that the old is not simply bad, that it delivers the 
goods, and --that the people have a real stake in it. There 
can be societies which are worse — there are such societies 
today. The system of corporate capitalism has the right 
to insist that those who work for its replacement justify 
their action.” 
Is this the newest Hegelian interpretation of “Negation 
of Negation”? Our answer is that the old is not only simply 
bad, but hopelessly rotten. This old is not like “the good 
old days,” which old people always find better or at least 
“not simply bad.” Today’s world has reached that stage 
where its gradual development can only be, as Rosa 
Luxemburg called it, Civilized Barbarism. To get such 
a barbaric society, an eruptive event, as transformations 
from one society to another in history used to require, 
* Dubcek, this new hero of world liberalism, is the symbol of 
avoiding a “blacklash.” He, in fact, betrayed the Czech people. 
He seems to have been scared by the famous Czech “backlash 
of 1618,” when the Emperor’s delegation in Prague was thrown 
out of the window, thus starting the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. 
For the next 350 years the Czech nation played the typical liberal 
role best expressed in literature by the good soldier Schweik. The 
“backlash” against Dubcek came just the same, although he avoided 
the levee en masse for which all conditions existed in 1968. He did 
not resist, because he fancied the idea of good old liberalism to 
which today the bureaucracy of the Communist parties and trade 
unions all over the world subscribes. His goal was that program 
which Jaroslav Hasek, the author of Schweik, once jokingly for 
his Socialist friends invented— the program’s goal was “to achieve 
progress in the framework of the existing.” 
would not be necessary any more. It is true that the 
world is pregnant with all the material and technical con- 
ditions of a better world. But these conditions, prerequisites 
of Socialism, are already beginning to die; they are rotting 
and decaying. Mass transportation, one of the first require- 
ments of advanced (and not so advanced) industrial 
society, often supported by the state, is now in this coun- 
try systematically, and with the help of the government, 
destroyed in the interest of real estate speculation afid 
automotive and oil capital. The progress achieved by the 
reduction of the working day to eight and even to six hours 
is annulled by a travel time to work of two to four hours 
in conditions which are more miserable than the factory 
and office work itself. The “good old days” were undoubt- 
edly better. This part of Marx’s description of capitalism 
is no longer valid, since the “dialectic of its progress” is 
disappearing. 
The threat to society becomes even greater because 
everybody sees the madness, but lives and even becomes 
affluent with it. To use Marcuse’s words, “People have a 
real stake in it.” Lewis Mumford mentions the fact that 
only those who are over fifty can remember many features 
of that older world that now seems ideal, including travel 
without a passport.* I would like to add that only those 
of us who are over sixty can remember that Anarchists 
and revolutionary Marxists from all over the world exiled 
without trouble to Switzerland, held openly their confer- 
ences there, and printed clandestine literature destined for 
their home countries. Today, under a supposedly more 
liberal government, the Swiss police often do not hesitate 
to practice their no-knock right, molesting harmless refu- 
gees at dawn even though passport and registration are in 
order, only under suspicion that they might be politically 
active. 
In general, the majestic equality before the law which 
Anatole France once satirized has become in practically 
all countries so “democratic” that the poor do not suffer 
less, but the privileged also experience bureaucratic and 
police chicanery. 
When Marcuse says, “there can be societies which are 
much worse — there are such societies today,” he is even 
more indefinite than his peculiar esoteric language should 
allow. What can be “much worse”? And why not name 
“such societies”? Does Marcuse mean that it is Russia 
which is “much worse”? We do not agree. Such an opinion 
is just as wrong as the Stalinist theory that Social Demo- 
crats are “social fascists” and worse than Nazis. 
With the reasoning that “the Czar is worse than the 
Kaiser,” all Socialist members of the German Reichstag 
(with the only exception of one extreme radical) voted for

ing that Hitler is much worse than Stalin, radicals all over the 
world (with very few exceptions) supported the Second 
World War. Such was always the trap of the “Alternative.” 
The Great Refusal, yes. But Concrete Alternative, no. 
Because where “the alternative” comes from, it means the

also of Moshe Dayan) . It is the acceptance, not the refusal,

The construction of the future and the completeness 
for all times is not our task. What we at present have 
to do is the reckless critique of all the existing — reckless 
in the sense that the critique is not afraid of its results 
and likewise not afraid of conflicts with the existing 
powers. Thus we do not approach the world doctrin- 
airily with a new principle: “Here is the truth, here 
kneel down!” We do not tell the world: “Let go of your 
fights, they are silly stuff. We wish to cry out to you 
the true password of the struggle.” We only show the 
world why it really struggles, and that consciousness 
is a thing which it must acquire, even if it does not want 
to. Then it will become obvious that mankind for a 
long time had the dream of a cause of which it only needs 
to possess the consciousness, to really possess this 
human cause. 
Foreword 
This book is for the people of the United States of 
America. It is not written for the members of fringe politi- 
cal groups, such as The Weathermen, or The Minutemen. 
Those radical groups don’t need this book. They already 
know everything that’s in here. If the real people of Amer- 
ica, the silent majority, are going to survive, they must edu- 
cate themselves. That is the purpose of this book. 
In this day and age, ignorance is not only inexcusable, 
it is criminal and perhaps fatal. The Anarchist Cookbook is 
not a revolutionary work in itself, just as a gun cannot 
shoot, but I have a sincere hope that it may stir some stag- 
nant brain cells into action. If the people of the United 
States do not protect themselves against the fascists, capi- 
talists, and communists, they will not be around much 
longer. Do I sound like an alarmist? Follow the process of 
disintegration: from the most immediate capitalist pollu- 
tion; through the rising inflation, which is creating an at- 
mosphere ripe for communism; to the final repression of 
the people by the fascists in power: 
Maybe I use the term revolution too frequently in this 
book, without really defining it. I will do so here. I do not 
particularly like any form of government but, if the major- 
ity of the people seem to think that they are incapable of 
governing themselves and want a government, then I think 
the principles the United States was born with are about 
the best there are. So now revolution comes to mean re- 
vitalization, bringing America back to where she was two 
hundred years ago. This is the first time I’ve thought of my- 
self as a reactionary. 
I believe that the people in power — not only political 
power, but also economic and social power — will not non- 
violently give up that power to the people. Power is not a 
material possession that can be given, it is the ability to act. 
Power must be taken, it is never given. 
I hope that, by the time the two hundredth anniversary 
of The First American Revolution rolls around, we will be 
able to look back at the sixties and early seventies as a 
dark era in the great history of a free nation. 
Introduction 
The human race, throughout its long history, has always 
tried to uncover the meaning or essence of certain ideas or 
concepts according to their particular frames of reference. 
This is also true of the twentieth century, but man is travel- 
ing so fast and his frame of reference is becoming so large 
that it is almost impossible to keep up with it. Throughout 
history, persons have attempted to redefine and put dated 
definitions to currently prevalent questions: This also has 
become increasingly difficult in this age of massive tech- 
nological discoveries coupled with a perpetual information 
and propaganda bombardment by the media. So I feel that 
an attempt on my part to redefine anarchy in terms of the 
twentieth century would be a pointless task. Such a pastime 
is best left to the politicians and the academicians. 
This is not the age of slender men in black capes lurking 
in alleyways with round bombs, just as it is not the age of 
political discussions in a Munich beer hall. This is a truly 
unique age, where the individual has become the supreme 
agent of anarchist theory, without his even being aware of 
it. Anarchy can no longer be defined as freedom from op- 
pression or lack of governmental control. It has gone fur- 
ther than that. It has become, especially in the young 
people today, a state of mind, an essence of being. It can 
be expressed as “doing their own thing,” or maybe just 
simply having the choice to do or not to do. 
Anarchy or anarchistic theory is the only ideology that is 
in the least bit optimistic. It places the full weight of re- 
sponsibility where it should be — on the shoulders of all the 
people, not just the select few. Its basic premise relies on 
an unshakable faith in human nature, and the primary 
goodness of the human race. 
Today, young people are not blind idealists. They are 
perhaps the most rational and practical generation this ' 
country has ever seen. There is no great movement com- 
parable to the Russian or French revolutions. There are 
just a great many individuals working as entities unto 
themselves, to create a new world order. Today has 
brought forth a great revival of anarchy in all fields: poli- 
tics, arts, music, education, and even to a small degree in 
business. Although this surge of individualism is present, 
you won’t find too many people willing to call it anarchy. 
But that’s just terminology. 
An anarchist is not necessarily a revolutionary, although 
it is more common than not that a person who has at- 
tempted to rid himself of exterior controls, for the purpose 
of developing his own philosophy, will find himself oppres- 
sed. This oppression may lead the individual to formulate 
ideas of insurrection and revolution. 
This book is for anarchists — those who feel able to dis- 
cipline themselves — on all the subjects (from drugs, to 
weapons, to explosives) that are currently illegal and sup- 
pressed in this country. It is my firm belief that the only 
laws an individual can truly respect and obey are those he 
instills in himself. This is not a revolutionary book in any 
traditional sense, but its premise is the sanctity of human 
dignity. If this human individual dignity and pride cannot 
be attained in the existing social order, there is only one 
choice for a real man, and that is revolution. 
There will never be a traditional revolution in this coun- 
try, in the sense of the Russian or French revolutions. The 
revolution in this country has already started. It is a multi- 
faceted battle on many different fronts. It is a battle politic- 
ally between the young freedom fighters in Chicago and the 
stagnant system, represented by arthritic old men making 
laws they do not understand, and making wars they have 
no feeling for. It is a battle between the poor blacks and 
the rich employers. It is a battle between the artists and 
the censors. It is a battle between the Black Panthers and

/ INTRODUCTION 
the police. It is a battle between the welfare mother and 
the bureaucracy of the city, and surprisingly enough it en- 
compasses the yearly battle between the taxpayer and the 
Internal Revenue Service. All these battles are but part of a 
larger war, being fought to liberate the minds and bodies of 
the people who feel freedom is the most important concept 
in their lives. 
If I could come out in this book and advocate complete 
revolution and the violent overthrow of the United States 
of America, without being thrown in jail, I would not have 
written The Anarchist Cookbook, and there would be no 
need for it. 
Read this book, but keep in mind that the topics written 
about here are illegal and constitutes a threat. Also, more 
importantly, almost all the recipes are dangerous, especially 
to the individual who plays around with them without 
knowing what he is doing. Use care, caution, and common 
sense. This book is not for children or morons. 
chapter one: 
Freedom will cure most things. . . . 
A. S. Neill, Summerhill 
Drugs are not central to anarchy, have nothing to do 
with politics, and may be considered the opposite of revolu- 
tion, since their use tends to create apathy. I believe basic- 
ally that this country is going through two revolutions: On 
one hand there is the political struggle, and on the other 
we are witnessing a cultural renaissance. The use of drugs 
comes under the birth of a new culture. After all the 
political battles have been fought and won, then will come 
the most difficult time of all. This is the time when the en- 
tire population — black and white, right and left — must 
move together to form a new society. This new society is 
being written about, talked about, planned by everyone. It 
will have to be a type of society completely devoid of the 
repression that is so present today. It will have to be based 
on respect, since the churches have a monopoly on trust. 
The use of drugs in this new culture will be free. There 
will be no more political arrests for pot or acid, for who 
will arrest whom? There will be no more black kids in jail, 
oil trumped-up charges, for there will be no more jails. 
“Pot is central to the revolution. It weakens social con- 
ditioning and helps create a whole new state of mind. The 
slogans of the revolution are going to be pot, freedom, 
license. The bolsheviks of the revolution will be long- 
haired pot smokers.” A quote from Jerry Rubin, who was 
sentenced early in 1970 to over five years for effectively 
speaking his mind. 
Certain drugs affect the mind and allow the individual, 
for the first time, to see the world freely, without enforced 
values and rituals. For the first time the person can see 
clearly the real inequities and the farcical absurdities. The 
antiquated drug laws and the archaic lawmakers have given 
us an underground. Now it is our job to make good use of 
it. 
Pot 
Pot, grass, or marihuana is available anywhere in the 
country, as the black market is widespread and thriving 
very well. Marihuana goes under a whole slew of names, 
such as Acapulco gold, Panama red, Vietnam green, and 
New York white. All of these names depict the potency 
and place of natural origin. Mexican and Vietnamese mari- 
huana are probably the best on the American market. Mid- 
dle Eastern grass is also highly prized, but not so readily 
available. There is no way of knowing what you are buy- 
ing. without first trying it, as most grasses look alike and 
smell very similar regardless of potency. The most inter- 
esting of all the different types of grasses is New York 
white, as it is a natural growth of high potency in a large 
metropolitan city. It is often found in vacant lots, growing 
by the side of alleys, and in schoolyards; but, strangely 
enough, the place where it has cropped up in abundance is 
in the sewers. The Department of Health and Sanitation 
have attempted to explain this phenomenon in several pub- 
lished reports. They have stated that the practice by illegal 
users of dumping marihuana seeds down the toilet, to pre- 
vent arrests, has resulted in massive subterranean growths. 
These growths were held directly responsible for many 
floods and blocked sewers. Apparently, according to the re- 
port, the conditions in the sewers are ideal for the growth 
of marihuana. It is damp and warm, and there is enough

debris lying around to make good fertilizer. The sewer 
plants usually reach a height of between 1 2 and 1 5 feet and 
are bleached white because of the lack of sunlight. This 
could answer a lot of questions — such as what the rats 
were doing in the middle of the Park Avenue mall. 
There are many different methods of growing grass, and 
it seems that everyone has just discovered the best fertilizer. 
I could not relay all of the methods in five books, so I 
have settled for two techniques which have proven ex- 
tremely successful for me. 
First Method 
Most seeds are fertile, but the best are from Mexico. 
Never in any circumstances throw seeds away, since mari- 
huana is a weed and will grow almost anywhere. The first 
step is to soak your seeds overnight in clean, lukewarm 
water. Your container should be a standard planter box. If 
this is not available, a plastic dish tray about two inches 
deep will serve just as well. Fill the container with washed 
fine sand and shredded sphagnum moss. If this is not readi- 
ly available, you can use regular soil. The soil should be 
packed firmly, and watered well so that the excess water is 
allowed to run off. Dig furrows the full length of the con- 
tainer about one-half-inch deep. Now you are ready to 
sow your seeds. Do so every inch. Fill in each furrow with 
soil, sand, moss, and water. Cover the container with a 
clear plastic sheet, and place it in a warm location where 
there are at least six hours of sunlight a day. The plants 
now remain on their own until they develop their first 
true leaves. 
Even if the material mentioned above is not available, 
almost the same degree of success can be accomplished by 
placing the seeds on several layers of water-soaked paper 
towels. Now cover the seeds with a plastic sheet just as 
above, and expose to sunlight. 
In about one week, signs of life should start to appear. 
Within two weeks, definite little leaves should be present. 
This is the time to transplant. The plot you intend to use 
for your transplant should be carefully prepared. Manure 
should be used for at least one week in advance of the 
actual transplant. The soil should be similar to the original 
soil used in the germinating box. All other weeds, in the 
general area of your plot, should be pulled up to allow 
your plant as much freedom of growth as possible. 
The original germinating box should be watered the day 
before you are going to transplant, so as to make the move 
easier on the plants, and cut root damage to a minimum. 
The plants should be placed in holes two to three inches 
deep, depending on the size of the plant. The earth around 
the plant should be loose, and, if possible, some earthworms 
should be added. If there is a lack of sunlight, a simple ring 
of tin foil around the plant can be very helpful. The first 
few days are the most critical after the actual transplant. 
If the plants survive the shock, there should be no reason 
why they shouldn’t grow into healthy, fully grown plants 
(which means, in certain climates, fifteen to twenty feet 
high). 
Care: 
Very little care is needed after this stage, with the excep- 
tion of fertilization. For fertilizers, one can use manure, 
soluble nitrogen, nitrate of soda, sulfate of ammonia, or 
rotting garbage (which has always been popular). To pro- 
duce a stronger plant, one can clip off the lower leaves; do 
this only when the plant reaches a height of at least three 
feet. The ground surrounding your plant should be kept 
clear of other weeds but, strangely enough, insects ignore 
marihuana and do no harm. 
Harvesting: 
As a rule, it is better to wait until the plants have gone 
to seed before they are cut, but, if you’re greedy, you can 
kill the goose that laid the golden egg. The best agent for 
drying is the sun, but if you live in the city it could prove 
embarrassing and dangerous to have five- or ten-foot mari- 
huana trees on your fire escape — in this case a sun lamp 
can be used. When using the sun, drying usually takes 
about two weeks. With a sun lamp, the pot is smokable 
after only three or four days. When drying is done, separ- 
ate the leaves and crush them. This will be the finest 
smoke, unless you have a female plant. If so, save the blos- 
soms for the most potent smoke there is. The stems and 
twigs can be chopped up and smoked in a pipe, or sold to a 
friend. 
Grass is basically a weed and can be grown anywhere, 
including indoors with artificial light. A sun lamp works 
well from a distance of two to three feet. For an interest- 
ing experiment, use infra-red light on part of your crop 
and a sun lamp on the other part, then compare. A bathtub 
or cement mixer is an ideal planter for the city dweller. 
Second Method 
This method is slightly more complicated than the last, 
but has achieved really good results. 
DRUGS 
/ 33 
First of all, you need a germinating box. This is con- 
structed as follows: Take one wooden milk crate and cut 
away the sides to six inches from its bottom (check the 
bottom diagram in Figure 1 ) . Cover the opening with clear 
plastic, leaving one flap open. Nail a strip of wood across 
the top and fix to it a sixty-watt light bulb. Now you have 
your germinating box. You will need Kitty Litter and mil- 
organite. Take one. part manure or milorganite and mix 
with five parts Kitty Litter, and fill the germinating box 
with two or three inches of this mixture and saturate with 
water. Now, place seeds, 20 to 30 per square inch, on top 
of the soil and cover with a quarter inch of milorganite and 
Kitty Litter. Keep the sixty-watt light bulb on twenty-four 
hours a day. When the seeds have broken the surface, use 
the bulb only as a supplement for regular sunlight. 
The plants should be grown in the germinating box for 
one month, and then transplanted. To transplant, select a 
spot with reasonably fertile soil, and of course reasonably 
safe from being discovered. When this is done, dig a hole 
about one foot deep and as wide as necessary. Leave each 
seedling room enough to grow; in other words, don’t crowd 
them together. 
To help stimulate growth, use peat, milorganite, manure, 
or any of the fertilizers mentioned in the first method, be- 
fore planting. After planting, water your plants, and use 
about a cup of hydrated lime per square yard of your plot. 
Marihuana usually takes four to eight months to mature, 
but it does adapt amazingly well to almost any growing 
season. You can usually tell the female plant, as it will be the 
smaller of the two. It should be treated with special care. 
To cure your crop, the ideal method is to hang the plants 
upside down in a barn or similar structure, where the ven- 
tilation is good. Now let the crop take its time. If you are 
in a hurry for some reason, and do not have a barn avail- 
able, you can dry your crop in the oven at a temperature 
below 200 degrees. A sun lamp can also be used as in the 
first method. 
Grading marihuana goes as follows: The most potent 
type of all is the female blossom tips (the sticky cluster of 
small leaves and seeds just at the tip of the female plant) . 
The small female inside upper leaves are also very potent. 
They are often found covered with resin and are con- 
sidered the second grade. The third grade of marihuana is 
the upper female leaves, which are potent but not as much 
as the first two grades. The fourth and final grade is made 
up of the male blossoms and all the male leaves on the 
upper half of the stem. 
If you decide against growing your own pot, for one 
reason or another, you still should have no difficulty in ob- 
taining grass. When buying grass, or anything illegal, there 
are several important things to remember. First, and prob- 
ably most important, is not to buy on the street, and in no 
circumstances buy from a stranger. Believe it or not, the 
cops are paying out millions of dollars a year to keep plain- 
clothesmen wandering around the streets trying to bust 
people. There is another reason that buying on the street 
is a bad scene: You don’t get a chance to try the stuff be- 
fore you buy it. The chances will be very good that when 
you get home, you will find that you have bought some of 
the best-tasting parsley or oregano that you have ever 
smoked. 
Cooking with pot 
Many people after cleaning their grass throw away the 
seeds, stems, and twigs. I would highly recommend that 
you save these, as there are many recipes for these odds 
and ends. A tasty hot drink that resembles tea can be 
made very simple by tying up all the waste from your stash 
into a muslin ball or into a piece of cheesecloth. Use the 
quantity you have on hand, as the quantity will determine 
the strength and potency. Now, drop the cheesecloth con- 
taining the grass into a kettle of water, and bring the water 
to a boil. Allow the kettle to boil for a few minutes, and 
then remove it from the flame and let it steep for another 
five minutes with the grass still inside. After this, the drink 
is ready. Just add sugar and lemon to taste. 
If you decide against growing pot, and want to eat your 
seeds, there is an interesting recipe for “seed pancakes.” 
It is prepared by lightly toasting a quarter of a cup of 
seeds into a large frying pan. Now, take the seeds from 
the frying pan and add them to a mixture of one cup of 
pancake mix, one egg, a quarter cup of milk, and one table- 
spoon of butter. Beat this mixture until it is smooth and 
creamy. Heat a frying pan with a small amount of butter, 
then pour in pancake batter. Turn the pancakes as they 
start to look done, or when the edges begin to turn brown. 
Repeat procedure until all the batter is used. Serve pan- 
cakes with butter, maple syrup, and honey. 
For a stimulating drink (sounds like all the rest of the 
cookbooks) place eight ounces milk, a few spoonfuls 
sugar, a tablespoon malted milk, half a banana, a half 
tablespoon grass, and three betel nuts in a blender. Keep 
34 /

the blender working full speed for a few minutes, then 
strain and serve. 
If you like candy, it’s very simple Jo make some using pot. 
Take a quarter cup of powdered grass and add water until it 
equals a full cup. Mix this with four cups sugar and two and 
a half cups corn syrup. Now heat in a large pot to 310 de- 
grees, and add red food coloring and mint flavoring. Remove 
the pot from the stove, and allow the mixture to cool a little, 
before pouring it onto wax paper. When the candy’s cool, 
cut it into squares and eat. 
One of the most common recipes for cooking with pot is 
spaghetti. This recipe doesn’t take too much special pre- 
paration: Just when you add your oregano, add at the same 
time a quarter cup grass, and allow it to simmer with the 
sauce. Be sure to use well-cleaned grass, unless you can 
get into eating twigs and stems. Another way of serving pot 
with spaghetti is to grind it up very fine and mix it with 
some ground cheese. Then sprinkle the cheese-pot mixture 
over the sauce just before eating. 
Dessert is probably the most important stage of the 
meal, since it will be the last thing your guests remember 
before they pass out all over your table. For an interesting 
dessert, grind a quarter ounce of grass very finely, and add 
enough water so it forms a paste. Now separately dissolve 
one and a half cups sugar into two cups milk. Add to this 
your pot paste and one lemon rind grated. Beat in a half 
cup heavy cream, until the mixture is firm and thick. Now 
pour the mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. Just before 
you’re ready to serve, rebeat the frozen mush until it be- 
comes light and fluffy. 
Since everyone else has a private recipe for an aphro- 
disiac, why shouldn’t I put one in here? I’ve heard people 
tell me, in all seriousness, that they believe the only true 
aphrodisiac is a case of beer in the back seat of a ’56 
Chevy. Well, if you’re not into that, you might as well try 
this recipe, because it’s got to work better than a case of 
beer. Pound one tablespoon unground mace, two cantha- 
rides beetles, one teaspoon fresh red saffron, and one tea- 
spoon of the best quality grass you can find. Pound all the 
ingredients together until they form a powder. Now add 
one pint of water and heat to boiling point. After boiling 
for a few minutes, reduce the heat and simmer for 45 min- 
utes or so, until the liquid is reduced to about a quarter of 
a cup. This can be served as a drink or over brown rice. I 
have not tried this recipe, as I have been unable to locate 
any cantharides.

If you happen to be in the country at a place where 
pot is being grown, here’s one of the greatest recipes you 
can try. Pick a medium-sized leaf off the marihuana plant 
and dip it into a cup of drawn butter, add salt, and eat. 
Hashish, or hash, is nothing more than the essence of the 
marihuana plant extracted and hardened into a block. 
Hash is usually smoked in a pipe, although there are many 
recipes that employ it as an ingredient. 
I have heard people say that hash has a different effect 
38 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
than marihuana. This is not true, in the sense that there is 
no difference between the two, with the exception being 
that hash is a good deal stronger. The most amazing thing 
about hashish is the price on the black market. An ounce 
of hash usually sells for anywhere between $60 and $100, 
depending on supply and demand. I say the price is amaz- 
ing because, with one kilo (2.2 lbs.) of grass, a person can 
easily make seven or eight ounces of hash. The usual price 
for a kilo of grass is about $150, whereas seven ounces of 
hash might bring $700. 
The process for extracting the essence of marihuana is 
a simple one, but it requires the utmost care. You need a 
kilo of grass to begin with, and a screen to sift it through. A 
kilo of grass usually comes in a block, compressed to- 
gether, so break down the block and gently put it through 
the screen. Remove all the dirt and foreign objects, but do 
not take out the stems. The seeds should also be taken 
out, as they are much too greasy for good hash. Now that 
you have separated the kilo and sifted it, place it in a large 
pot and cover with rubbing alcohol (about one and a half 
gallons per kilo). Now boil the mixture for about three 
hours. Be sure to use a hot plate or electric stove rather 
than gas, as alcohol is highly inflammable, and should 
never be exposed to a naked flame. After three hours, 
strain liquids out of the pot and store in a plastic container 
labeled “solution 1 .” Now take the mush you have left and 
repeat the boiling with fresh alcohol for another three 
hours. After two alcohol extractions, each time using fresh 
alcohol, follow the same procedure but substitute water for 
alcohol. The water must be boiled at a higher temperature 
than the alcohol, but for only one hour. This boiling pro- 
cedure with water should be performed twice. Once these 
procedures have been performed, strain off the liquids 
again and store in another container, and label “solution 
2.” Now reduce volumes of both solutions by boiling in 
separate pots, turn down the heat as each solution begins 
to thicken. When each solution is reasonably thickened, 
combine them and boil a little more on the hot plate. At 
this point the solution should have the consistency of 
modeling clay. Now heat a cupful of turpentine, and add to 
the mush. Be extra careful with the turpentine, as even the 
vapors are inflammable. Add 2 ozs. of pine resin and 
stir pot for ten minutes, under low heat. Now pour mush 
into a baking tin, two or three inches deep, and heat in the 
oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. After this you should 
have some really good hash but, if the hash is still greasy 
after this last step, just leave it in the oven for another ten 
minutes or so until it dries out. Be careful not to burn the 
hash. 
This last recipe is for the extraction of hashish from 
marihuana, but in the Middle Eastern countries, where 
they can afford it, there is another method for the prepara- 
tion of hash. When the hemp or marihuana plants are dry- 
ing, they are hung upside down in a room lined with bur- 
lap. As the plants dry, the resin and smaller leaves fall onto 
the burlap. When, after a few weeks, the burlap is taken 
up, the material covering it is the finest-quality marihuana 
extraction possible. This substance is taken and boiled, 
then compressed together to form a hard solid. 
Hash can be smoked either in a pipe or by mixing it 
with tobacco in a cigarette. Traditionally, hashish has been 
smoked in a hookah or water pipe, which is nothing more 
than a large pipe that takes the smoke and cools it by run- 
ning it through water. The hookah is more than just a pipe 
in many Middle Eastern countries, since it has more than 
one hose, and more than one smoker can participate at a 
time. I have heard that substituting wine or flavored brandy 
for the water is a fantastic way to get there.

Cooking trith hash 
Hash is also an excellent way to enhance your cooking. 
It has had a long history in the kitchen, going all the way 
back to the early civilizations around the Ganges River. It 
is also noted that many famous personalities throughout 
history had experiences with hashish. Marco Polo on his 
return to Italy mentioned frequently in his diary a strange 
substance that put a man in a drunkenlike stupor, yet it was 
unlike anything he had experienced before.

LSD 
I think, of all the drugs on the black market today, LSD 
is the most interesting and the strangest. It is the most re- 
cent major drug to come to life in the psychedelic subcul- 
ture. Huxley experimented with mescaline many years be- 
fore psychedelics reached their mass-market proportions, 
but this experimentation was not with the same frame of 
mind as these drugs are handled today. Probably the great- 
granddaddy to the whole psychedelic community was An- 
tonin Artaud, who personally experimented with peyote in 
Mexico. The difference between Huxley’s and Artaud’s 
experimentation was that Huxley managed to keep his 
experiences under laboratory controls, which he set up 
himself, whereas Artaud allowed his experiences to become 
part of his life. Artaud was changed by his encounters with 
peyote, but is this bad? A dirty shirt is also changed when 
it is washed. Through this change, Artaud was able to see 
and understand ideas and concepts on a different level. 
He was able to tear apart rationalizations, without regard 
for contemporary methods of organization, or even con- 
temporary versions of truth. Artaud found, in his own way, 
his own truth and his own structure of values. They locked 
him up. . . . 
I died at Rodez under electroshock. 
I died. Legally and medically died. 
40 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
Electroshock coma lasts fifteen minutes. A half an hour 
or more and then the patient breathes. 
Now one hour after the shock, I still had not awakened 
and had stopped breathing. Surprised at my abnormal 
rigidity, an attendant had gone to get the physician in 
charge, who, after examining me with a stethoscope, found 
no more signs of life in me. 
This passage is taken from The Artaud Anthology, 
published by City Lights Publishers. I find it extremely 
difficult to throw this off as the ravings of a madman for, if 
that be true, then there can be no truth, only madness and 
sanity, logic and illogic. If one then accepts the acceptable, 
he finds a narrow channel is clear, but the presence of il- 
logic and the so-called insanities will always pry and harp 
in the distance. 
LSD has never caused insanity. It does not have that 
power. Only man can distinguish between sanity and in- 
sanity. I have never seen an insane bird. Granted there are 
some individuals who shouldn’t take psychedelics, but this 
is, and must be, their choice. All LSD does is allow a man 
to look upon ordinary things, everyday things, and even on 
himself, many times for the first time, with clarity of vision. 
He can look and not be hampered by false-propped values 
and socially limited scope. He can look upon the world and 
see beauty where it did not exist before. He can perceive 
the ugliness for the first time. He can roar with laughter 
at the multitude of absurdities surrounding him. He can 
look into himself and see truthfully the mildew and the rot. 
LSD cannot bring out latent qualities in your personal- 
ity. It cannot make you into a crazy, just as it cannot make 
you into a warmer, more beautiful, person. What LSD can 
do is show you what you as a person are comprised of, and 
break down truthfully your make-up. LSD is not a religion, 
and I’ve never found anything really divine about it at all. 
The real religion, if you want to put it in those terms, is 
the being itself. LSD is nothing more than a medium to dis- 
cover the essence of being. 
LSD, or acid, has been illegal for the last few years; 
therefore it is readily available on the black market. When 
buying anything on the black market, there are a couple 
of things to note, but these are especially important with 
acid. 
1 . Never buy from a stranger, or on the street. 
2. Never front money. 
3. If you are holding a large amount of money, do not go 
anywhere alone with someone you do not trust. Many 
people who have got into dealing pot and acid are, in 
reality, junkies. 
4. When going to make a deal for dope, do not take a 
weapon with you. This is provoking violence and legal 
hassles. If you don’t trust the guy, then don’t deal with 
him. 
5. Never buy a large quantity of any drug without first 
sampling it. 
6. When making a deal for acid and you are at the deal- 
er’s apartment, do not accept food or drink from him; for 
the real acid may be in the food rather than the cap you 
sample. 
7. Bad acid is usually nothing more than speed, or rat 
poison. 
8. About a year ago there was a substance called L.B.J. 
going around. If you happen to come across it, do not buy 
it. L.B.J. is a mixture of acid, belladonna, and heroin. It 
is the freakiest, worst, most fucked-up trip you will ever 
go on. Belladonna in quantity is a deadly poison. 
9. About 99 percent of all of what is claimed to be 
T.H.C. (synthetic pot) that is for sale on the street is 
not really T.H.C. at all. The expense of making synthetic 
pot is said to be about $15 per capsule, and a capsule of 
alleged T.H.C. usually sells on the street for about $2.50. 
Obviously the vendors are either philanthropists (not like- 
ly) or they are selling you something other than T.H.C. 
10. When buying grass, watch out for damp grass or 
grass sprayed with sugar, as this adds a lot of weight to the 
dope. 
11. Another favorite con game is “in the front, out the 
back.” This usually occurs when your dealer tells you he 
is going up to an apartment to get your stuff, but you have 
to front the money, and wait for him on the street. You 
may be waiting a long time. 
12. Do not attempt to smuggle any drugs across the bor- 
der from Mexico. The federal government has imposed a 
crackdown and they’re busting people left and right. 
Making LSD in the laboratory 
To make synthetic acid, you need a basic understand- 
ing of chemistry and access to a lab. Since I don’t quite 
understand all the chemical hocus-pocus, I’m going to cop

stand chemistry, just skip this recipe and go on to the next 
one for acid, it’s much simpler. 
Preparation for Lysergic Acid Amides: 
United States Patent Office 2,736,728 
Patented February 28, 1956 
Richard P. Pioch, Indianapolis, Indiana, assignor, to Eli 
Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, a corporation of 
Indiana. 
No drawing. Application December 6, 1954, Serial No. 
473,443. 10 Claims. (Cl. 260-285.5) 
This invention relates to the preparation of lysergic 
acid amides and to a novel intermediate compound use- 
ful in the preparation of said amides. 
Although only a few natural and synthetic amides of 
lysergic acid are known, they possess a number of differ- 
ent and useful pharmacologic properties. Especially use- 
ful is ergonovine, the N-(l(+)-l -hydroxy isopropyl) 
amide of d-lysergic acid, which is employed commerci- 
ally as an oxytocic agent. 
Attempts to prepare lysergic acid amides by the usual 
methods of preparing amides, such as reacting an amine 
with lysergic acid chloride or with an ester of lysergic 
acid, have been unsuccessful. United States Patents No. 
2,090,429 and No. 2,090,430, describe processes of pre- 
paring lysergic acid amides and, although these pro- 
cesses are effective to accomplish the desired conversion 
of lysergic acid to one of its amides, they are not without 
certain disadvantages. 
By my invention I have provided a simple and con- 
venient method of preparing lysergic acid amides, which 
comprises reacting lysergic acid with trifluoroacetic an- 
hydride to produce a mixed anhydride of lysergic and 
trifluoroacetic acids, and when reacting the mixed an- 
hydride with a nitrogenous base having at least one 
hydrogen linked to nitrogen. The resulting amide of 
lysergic acid is isolated from the reaction mixture by 
conventional means. 
The reaction of the lysergic and the trifluoroacetic 
anhydride is a low temperature reaction, that is, it 
must be carried out at a temperature below about 0 de- 
grees C. The presently preferred temperature range is 
about -15 C. to about -20 C. This range is suffi- 
ciently high to permit the reaction to proceed at a desir- 
ably fast rate, but yet provides an adequate safeguard 
against a too rapid reaction which would result in a 
high reaction temperature and consequent excessive de- 
composition of the mixed anhydride. 
The reaction is carried out in a suitable dispersing 
agent, that is, one which is inert with respect to the re- 
actants. The lysergic acid is relatively insoluble in dis- 
persants suitable for carrying out the reaction, so it is 
suspended in the dispersant. 
Two gallons of trifluoroacetic anhydride are reouired 
per mol. of lysergic acid for the rapid and complete 
conversion of the lysergic acid into the mixed anhydride. 
It appears that one molecule of the anhydride associates 
with or favors an ionic adduct with one molecule of the 
lysergic which contains a basic nitrogen atom and that 
it is the adduct which reacts with a second molecule of 
trifluoroacetic anhydride to form the mixed anhydride 
along with one molecule of trifluoroacetic acid. The 
conversion of the lysergic acid to the mixed anhydride 
occurs within a relatively short time, but to insure a 
complete conversion the reaction is allowed to proceed 
for about one to three hours. 
The mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic 
acids is relatively unstable, especially at room tempera- 
ture and above, and must be stored at a low tempera- 
ture. This temperature instability of the mixed anhy- 
dride makes it desirable that it be converted into a ly- 
sergic acid amide without unnecessary delay. The mixed 
anhydride itself, since it contains a lysergic acid group, 
also can exist in the reaction mixture in large part as an 
ionic adduct with trifluoroacetic anhydride or trifluoro- 
ace'tic acid. It is important for maximum yield of prod- 
uct that the lysergic acid employed in the reaction be 
dry. It is most convenient to dry the acid by heating it at 
about 105-110 degrees C. in a vacuum of about 1mm. 
of mercury or less for a few hours, although any other 
customary means of drying can be used. 
The conversion of the mixed anhydride into an amide 
by reacting the anhydride with the nitrogenous base, 
such as an amino compound, can be carried out at room 
„ temperature or below. Most conveniently the reaction is 
carried out by adding the cold solution of the mixed an- 
42 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
hydride to the amino compound or a solution thereof 
which is at about room temperature. Because of the 
acidic components present in the reaction mixture of the 
mixed anhydride, about five mols or equivalents of the 
amino compound are required per mole or equivalent 
of mixed anhydride for maximal conversion of the 
mixed anhydride to the amide. Preferably a slight excess 
over the five mols is employed to insure complete utili- 
zation of the mixed anhydride. If desired, a basic sub- 
stance capable of neutralizing the acid components pres- 
ent in the reaction mixture, but incapable of interfering 
with the reaction, can be utilized. A strongly basic terti- 
ary amine is an example of such a substance. In such 
case, about one equivalent of amino compound to be 
converted to a lysergic acid amide, as well as any un- 
converted lysergic acid, can be removed from the re- 
action mixture and can be re-employed in other con- 
versions. 
A preferred method for carrying out the process of 
this invention is as follows: 
Dry lysergic acid is suspended in a suitable vehicle as 
acetonitrile, and the suspension is cooled to about -15 
C. or -20 C. To the suspension is then added slowly a 
solution of about two equivalents of trifluoroacetic an- 
hydride dissolved in acetonitrile and previously cooled 
to about -20 degrees C. The mixture is maintained in 
a low temperature for about one to three hours to insure 
the completion of the formation of the mixed anhydride 
of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids. 
The solution of the mixed anhydride is then added to 
about five equivalents of the amino compound which is 
to be reacted with the mixed anhydride. The amino 
compound need not be previously dissolved in a solvent, 
although it is usually convenient to use a solvent. The 
reaction is carried out with the amino compound or 
solution of amino compound at or about room tempera- 
ture or below. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand 
at room temperature for one or two hours, preferably in 
the dark, and the solvent is then removed by evapora- 
tion in vacuo at a temperature which desirably is not 
greatly in excess of room temperature. The viscous resi- 
due, consisting of the amide together with excess amine 
and amine salts, is taken up in a mixture of chloroform 
and water. The water is separated and the chloroform 
solution which contains the amide is washed several 
times with water to remove excess amine and the vari- 
ous amine salts formed in the reaction, including that of 
any unconverted lysergic acid. The chloroform solution 
is then dried and evaporated, leaving a residue of lyser- 
gic acid amide. The amide so obtained can be purified 
by any conventional procedure. 
t 
Dispersants suitable for the purpose of this invention 
are those which are liquids at the low temperatures em- 
ployed for the reaction and are of such an inert nature 
that they will not react preferentially to the lysergic acid 
with trifluoroacetic anhydride. Among suitable dispers- 
ants are acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, propionitrile, 
an<4 the like. Additional suitable agents will readily be 
apparent from the foregoing enumeration. Of those 
listed above, acetonitrile is preferred since it is non-re- 
activi and mobile at the temperature used, and is rela- 
tively volatile and hence readily separable from the re- 
action mixture by evaporation in vacuo. 
A wide variety of nitrogenous bases such as amino 
compounds can be reacted with the mixed anhydride to 
form a lysergic acid amide. As previously stated, the 
amino compound must contain a hydrogen atom at- 
tached to nitrogen to permit amide formation. Illustra- 
tive amino compounds which can be reacted are am- 
monia, hydrazine, primary amines such as glycine, 
ethanolamine, diglycylglycine, norephedrine, aminopro- 
panol, butanolamine, diethylamine, ephedrine, and the 
like. 
When an alkanolamine such as ethanolamine or 
aminopropanol is reacted with the mixed anhydride of 
lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids, the reaction product 
contains not only the desired hydroxy amide but also, 
to a minor extent, some amino ester. These two iso- 
metric substances arise because of the bi-functional 
nature of the reacting alkanolamine. Ordinarily the am- 
ino ester amounts to no more than 25-30 percent of 
the total amount of reaction product, but in cases where 
the amino group is esterically hindered, the proportion 
of ammo ester will be increased. The amino ester can 
readily be converted to the desired hydroxy amide, and 
the over-all yield of the latter increased by treating the 
amino ester, or the mixture of amide and ester with al- 
coholic alkali to cause the rearrangement of the amino 
ester to the desired hydroxy amide. Most conveniently 
the conversion is carried out by dissolving the amino 
DRUGS / 43 
ester or mixture containing the amino ester in a mini- 
mum amount of alcohol and adding to the mixture a 
twofold amount of 4 N alcoholic potassium hydroxide 
solution. The mixture is allowed to stand at room tem- 
perature for several hours, the alkali is neutralized with 
acid, and the lysergic acid amide is then isolated and 
purified. 
It should be understood that, as used herein, the 
term “lysergic acid” is used generically as inclusive of 
any or all of the four possible stereoisomers having the 
basic lysergic acid structure. Isomers of the lysergic 
acid series can be separated or interconverted by means 
known to the art. 
This invention is further illustrated by the following 
specific examples. 
Example One 
Preparation of the mixed anhydride of lysergic and tri- 
fluoroacetic acids: 
5.36 g. of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml. of 
acetonitrile and the suspension is cooled to about -20 
degrees C. To this suspension is added a cold (-20 de- 
grees C.) solution of 8.82 g. of trifluoroacetic anhydride 
in 75 ml. of acetonitrile. The mixture is allowed to stand 
at -20 degrees C. for about 1 '/i hours during which time 
the suspended material dissolves, and the d-lysergic acid 
is converted to the mixed anhydride of lysergic and tri- 
fluoroacetic acids. The mixed anhydride can be separ- 
ated in the form of an oil by evaporating the solvent in 
vacuo at a temperature below about 0 degrees centi- 
grade. 
Example Two 
Preparation of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide: 
A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid and 
trifluoroacetic acid in 200 ml. of acetonitrile is obtained 
by reacting 5.36 g. d-lysergic acid and 8.82 g. trifluoro- 
acetic anhydride in accordance with the procedure of 
example one. The acetonitrile solution containing mixed 
anhydride is added to 1 50 ml. of acetonitrile containing 
7.6 g. of diethylamine. The mixture is held in the dark 
at room temperature for about two hours. The acetoni- 
trile is evaporated in vacuo leaving a residue which 
comprises the “normal” and “iso” forms of d-lysergic 
acid N,N-diethyl amide together with some lysergic acid. 
the diethylamine salt of trifluoroacetic acid and like by- 
products. The residue is dissolved in a mixture of 150 
ml. of chloroform and 20 ml. of ice water. The chloro- 
form layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is ex- 
tracted with four 50 ml. portions of chloroform. The 
chloroform extracts are combined and are washed four 
times with about 50 ml. portions of cold water in order 
to remove residual amounts of amine salts. The chloro- 
form layer is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, 
and the chloroform is evaporated in vacuo. A solid resi- 
due of 3.45 gm. comprising the “normal” and “iso” 
forms of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide is obtained 
This material is dissolved in 160 ml. of a 3-to-l mixture 
of benzene and chloroform, and is chromatographed 
over 240 g. of basic alumina. As the chromatogram is 
developed with the same solvent, two blue fluorescing 
zones appear on the alumina column. The more rapidly 
moving zone is d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide which 
is eluted with about 3000 ml. of the same solvent as 
above, the course of the elution being followed by 
watching the downward movement of the more rapidly 
moving blue fluorescing zone. The eluate is treated with 
tartaric acid to form the acid tartrate of d-lysergic acid 
N,N-diethyl amide which is isolated. The acid tartrate 
of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide melts with decom- 
position at about 190-196 degrees Centigrade. 
The di-iso-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide which 
remains absorbed on the alumina column as the second 
fluorescent zone is removed from the column by elution 
with chloroform. The “iso” form of the amide is recov- 
ered by evaporating the chloroform eluate to dryness in 
vacuo. 
Example Three 
Preparation of d-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl 
amide: 
A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid 
and trifluoroacetic acid is prepared from 2.68 g. of d- 
lysergic acid and 4.4 g. of trifluoroacetic acid anhydride 
in 100 ml. of acetonitrile by the method of Example 
One. This solution is added to 6:03 g. of diethylamino- 
ethylamine. The reaction mixture is kept in the dark at 
room temperature for \Vt hours. The acetonitrile is 
evaporated, and the residue treated with chloroform and 
water as described in Example Two. The residue treated 
comprising d-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide 
44 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
is dissolved in several ml. of ethyl acetate, and the solu- 
tion is cooled to about 0 degrees centigrade, whereupon 
di-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide separ- 
ates in crystalline form. The crystalline material is filtered 
off, and the filtrate reduced in volume to obtain an addi- 
tional amount of crystalline amide. Recrystallization 
from ethyl acetate of the combined fractions of crystalline 
material yields d-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl 
amide melting at about 157-158 degrees centigrade. The 
optical rotation is as follows: 
[x] d 26 = 372 degrees (c. = 1.3 in pyridine) 
There has been in the last few years a great deal of dis- 
cussion about the correct treatment for victims of bad LSD 
trips. When an individual does go into a panic on acid, it is 
an extremely delicate situation. Although it has been said 
that tranquilizers, such as thorazine, will help to calm the 
person down, be very careful, as certain drugs react vio- 
lently with tranquilizers (STP). My advice in a situation of 
that sort is just to attempt to create an atmosphere of reas- 
surance and sympathy. In no circumstances, except real 
uncontrollable panic, should a person on acid be taken to 
a city hospital. If you want a freaky experience, spend a 
couple of hours at any city hospital and watch the people 
die in the halls! 
Talk to the person and remind him that he is under the 
influence of acid. Try to calm him down. Even a change of 
environment can effectively reverse a bad trip. 
Making LSD in the kitchen 
For those readers who couldn’t make head or tail of 
the last recipe for acid, there is a much simpler one. It 
basically extracts the lysergic acid amides either from 
morning glory seeds or Hawaiian wood rose seeds. It 
can be prepared in the kitchen. 
1. Grind up 150 grams of morning glory seeds or baby 
Hawaiian wood rose seeds. 
2. In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two 
days. 
3. Filter the solution through a tight screen. 
4. Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to 
dry. 
5. For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of 
wood alcohol 
6. Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and label- 
ing it “1.” 
7. Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two 
days. 
8. Filter and throw away the mush. 
9. Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution 
labeled “1.” 
10. Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evap- 
orate. 
11. When all the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum re- 
mains. This should be scraped up and put into cap- 
sules. 
30 grams of morning glory seeds = one trip 
15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = one trip 
Many companies, such as Northop-King, have been 
coating their seeds with a toxic chemical, which is poison. 
Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it is much safer and 
cheaper. Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly 
from:

LSD dosages 
The basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of 
acid is available and what medium of ingestion is used. 
Chemically the potency of LSD-25 is measured in micro- 
grams, or mics. If you’re chemically minded or making 
your own acid, then computing the number of micrograms 
is very important. Usually between 300 to 500 mics is 
plenty for a five- to eight-hour trip, depending on the 
quality of the acid, of course. I have heard of people tak- 
ing as much as 1,500 to 2,000 mics. This is not only ex- 
tremely dangerous, it is also wasteful. 
LSD comes packaged in many different forms. The pro- 
verbial sugar cube is pretty passe, in the sense that other 
more feasible methods have taken its place. The most com- 
mon are listed below. 
1. The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried drop 
of LSD on it, is always around. Usually one spot equals 
one trip. 
2. Capsuled acid is extremely tricky, as the cap can be al- 
DRUGS / 45 
most any color, size, and potency. Always ask what the 
acid is cut with, as a lot of acid is cut with either speed 
or strychnine. Also note dosage. 
3. Small white or colored tablets have been known to con- 
tain acid, but, as with the capsuled acid, it is impossible 
to tell potency, without asking. 
4. I have heard about some characters who attempted to 
shoot acid. Shooting any drug is a bad scene. Stay away 
from it. I cannot imagine what their rush was like, but 
would certainly advise against this form of drug abuse. 
Peyote 
I remember once when I was in Mexico. It was Juarez 
or maybe Laredo, I can’t remember, but all the border 
towns are fantastic. There’s no crime rate in a border town 
— at least not in the sense it is reckoned in the United 
States. How would you measure it? It’s just a real pleasure 
to go where the people aren’t all hung up about ethics and 
moral bullshit. Everyone’s been paid off and, if they 
haven’t, they own the town. Every cab driver has a friend 
who just happens to own a drug store, a friend who just 
happens to own a farm with a little marihuana on it, and 
a virgin daughter with three kids. 
Well, I remember that my first experience with peyote 
was there. I’d been drinking, and hadn’t quite got two 
weeks’ worth of speed out of my system, when this little kid 
scared the shit out of me. All of a sudden he starts scream- 
ing, “Hey mysta, hey mysta hippee, you vant, you want 
some good peyote, mama pick herself?” I’m stupid and one 
of the biggest suckers alive. I would let the devil himself 
lead me into hell, with my eyes closed, just to see what 
it was like. I told the kid O.K. He wanted the money first. 
I’m not quite that stupid. We went together. 
We went for a trip together, maybe five or six miles, way 
1 out of town. The countryside was really pretty nice, but I 
1 couldn’t dig it, I was too uptight. Finally he stopped and 
told me that this was his home. It was five pieces of cor- 
: rugated iron propped up together with pieces of cloth and 
' wood covering the cracks. Pretty depressing. 
Again he wanted to take the money, and have me out- 
side. Again I told him to bring it out to me and I’d pay 
him. Then he did something that scared the shit out of me. 
He invited me into his house. I kept wondering how many 
brothers were waiting for me, but then I guess alcohol and 
speed tend to inflate the ego, as all I was saying to myself 
was, “Shit, if they come at me, I swear to God I’ll take one 
of the cocksuckers with me.” 
He took me around to the back of his home, and held a 
piece of orange crate open for me. My first impression of 
the inside was darkness, but then slowly, as my eyes began 
to get used to the dark, I saw a woman, not a fat mama, 
as I had expected, but rather a thin, delicate woman, with 
the lines of the world carved deeply into her face. She was 
squatting by the glowing remains of a fire, in the center of 
the room. As she rose to meet her child, I realized she was 
not as old as I had supposed, and she was strangely exciting 
in the gloom of the dying embers. 
The kid started to scream, again. I guess all he could do 
was scream, since I never heard him talk. He was scream- 
ing so fast I couldn’t understand a word of it. It was like 
gibberish, and the faster it came out of his mouth, the fast- 
er my head spun. I really began to get the spins. The wom- 
an must have realized something was wrong with me, as 
she took my arm and sat me on the floor. When I sat down 
I felt better, my senses started to come back to me, and the 
kid wasn’t screaming any more. 
I saw his mother rise and walk over to a large earthen pot, 
where she took something out, and brought it back to me. 
Then I realized that it must be the peyote, and the peyote 
was the reason I was there in the first place. I took a hand- 
ful from her and shoved it into my mouth. It was the most 
disgusting stuff I’ve ever eaten. After I had finally managed 
to swallow it, I handed my entire wallet to the woman. 
I don’t know why I did this, maybe out of relief that the 
kid didn’t have any older brothers, or maybe just because 
I was incapable of counting. I don’t know, but all of a sud- 
den, like a shotgun shell in the gut, my whole stomach was 
on fire. I could feel all the food and drink inside my stom- 
ach churning around and around like a God-damn amuse- 
ment park. I knew I was going to vomit. I knew there was 
no stopping it, it was like a rough day at the beach, waves 
of convulsion. 
I got up and ran to the street, wondering vaguely in the 
back of my mind whether I had not, in fact, been mildly 
poisoned. As I hit the dirt road, I knew that was it, and let 
my stomach fly. It seemed the spasms would never end. I 
felt all my organs being ripped out one after another. 
After thoroughly purging myself, I made my way back 
to town, quite stoned, and missing a wallet.

/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
Figure 4. Peyote. 
Peyote is a small brown cactus, which in natural growth 
barely protrudes above the ground. On top of this cactus 
are small spineless buttons, which resemble mushrooms. It 
is within these buttons that the mescal is found, and the 
buttons are usually the only parts eaten, although certain 
tribes of Indians do eat root and all. Peyote has had a long 
history that stretches all the way back to the ancient 
Aztecs, who considered it divine and used it in many of 
their religious ceremonies. 
The use of peyote was rediscovered in a few isolated 
tribes in Mexico, and its use once again became wide- 
spread. The Indians in the Southwest formally organized a 
church with peyote as one of their sacraments. The Native 
American Church, which has over two hundred thousand 
members, is one of the few places in the world where a 
person can legally get stoned. Their members can legally 
get stoned and blame all their bad trips on God. 
The traditional peyote preparation has always been ex- 
actly the same as it is today. The buttons are removed from 
the cactus, and cut into small round disks. These are then 
dried in the sun for several days. Then they are crushed 
and placed in boiling water to make a form of tea. Peyote 
can be eaten raw, but it tastes like vomit. 
And this same one, with a conceit born of this kind of 
uncouth purgation, started spitting a few moments later. 
He spat after having drunk the peyote like the rest of us. 
For the twelve phases of the dance were done* and as 
dawn was about to break, we were handed the grated 
peyote, which looked like some kind of slimy chowder; 
and in front of each of us a fresh hole was dug to receive 
the sputum and vomit of our mouths, which had been 
made holy by the peyote’s passing through.

about jesus; the indian goes into his teepee and talks to 
Jesus.

The bad taste and foul smell of the peyote can be gotten 
rid of by a simple process. There are two basic methods 
which follow, and after them the recipe for preparing syn- 
thetic mescaline, which takes a knowledge of chemistry. 
Extracting mescaline from peyote in the kitchen 
Method One 
1. Obtain 50 g. of dried ground peyote and put in a 500 
ml. Erlenmeyer flask. 
2. Add 250 cc. of wood alcohol, cover the flask tightly, 
and let cactus powder soak it up for one day, with 
occasional stirring. 
3. Pour off the wood-alcohol solution into a 500 ml. 
beaker, filter properly, and place in a well-ventilated 
place to evaporate. Caution: Wood alcohol is flam- 
mable, keep away from fire. 
4. Again soak the plant powder in the flask for two hours, 
but in 100 cc. of 1 -normal hydrochloric acid. 
5. Filter, discard the mush, and combine the filtered HCL 
solution with the residue from the evaporated wood 
alcohol solution. Filter again. 
6. To the solution add enough 2-Normal potassium 
hydroxide until the solution is neutral (turns ph paper 
beige). 
7. Add 100 cc. of chloroform, stir, and let the mixture 
stand until it separates into two layers. 
8. Separate the two layers, using a separatory funnel and 
discard the water (top) layer. (See Figure 5.) 
9. Add 40 cc. of water to the chloroform, shake, and 
separate the layers again. Discard top layer. 
10. Filter the chloroform, evaporate, and dissolve the 
„ gummy residue in 20 cc. of water. Refilter it. Makes 
about one dose. 
Method Two 
1. Take fresh peyote buttons, wash, remove skins, and 
remove all tufts and foreign particles. 
2. Take the peyote meat and grind it in a meat grinder or 
coffee grinder. 
3. Allow ground peyote meat to dry, then grind again as 
before. 
DRUGS / 47 
Separatory Funnel 
Figure 5. A separatory funnel (used in steps 8 and 9 of the 
recipe for the extraction of mescaline from peyote). 
4. Boil peyote meat for five hours, keeping plenty of water 
in the pot to prevent burning. 
5. Take skin and bark of peyote and break it down by 
beating on a cutting board. When it is broken down, boil 
for five hours in a separate pot. 
6. Strain liquids from both pots and combine. Throw away 
the peyote mush. 
7. Boil this solution until it becomes dark. Do not allow 
it to become too thick. Label it solution “A.” 
8. Now cool solution “A.” 
9. Take the cool solution “A” and fill half a separatory 
funnel. 
10. Add about an equal volume of ethyl ether, and shake 
for two minutes. 
11. Now allow the liquids to settle and form layers. Draw 
off the water solution (bottom layer) by turning the 
stop cork. Do not draw off the ether solution. 
12. Now process all of solution ‘,‘A” in this manner. Label 
all drawn-off solution “B.” Put the leftover ether solu- 
tion into a container and throw away. 
13. Boil down solution “B” to cut down volume, but do not 
allow it to become too thick. 
14. Add a phenophthalein indicator to solution “B,” until 
the solution turns red. 
15. Mix in small amounts of a diluted sulfuric acid solu- 
tion, until the red color disappears. Do not add any 
more acid than required. 
16. Add one teaspoon of baking powder (to neutralize the 
acid) for each gallon of solution. Boil again to reduce 
volume. 
17. Place solution “B” in the refrigerator for several hours, 
but do not freeze it. 
18. While it is still cold, pour off as much of the liquid as 
possible, leaving the crystal in the container. Rinse the 
crystals with near-freezing water. 
19. Add rinse water with water poured off crystals. Boil 
this solution to reduce volume and then cool in refrig- 
erator. Repeat procedure for formation of the crystals. 
These crystals are nearly pure mescaline sulphate. Al- 
low crystals to dry and then capsule. 
This usually makes between 30-80 mg. per button. 
Making synthetic mescaline in the laboratory 
The next recipe is for making synthetic mescaline, and, 
as I do not understand it, I have copped out again and 
quoted straight from! the book. If you do not understand 
chemistry talk, skip this one. It will give you more headaches 
than it’s worth. It is taken directly from the Journal of the 
American Chemical Society, a trade publication, which for 
the layman is as screwy as Greek. 
The process of making a new synthesis of mescaline: 
Makepeace U. Tsao, “A New Synthesis of Mescaline,” 
Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 73, pp. 
5495-96 (November, 1951) 
The cactus alkaloid, mescaline, B-(3, 4, 5 Trimethoxy- 
phenylethylamine, has been studied for some years, be- 
48 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
cause of its most interesting effects on the psychic states 
of human subjects. Since the elucidation of the chemical 
structure of the alkaloid through the synthesis of Spath 
2 >-7 a few other methods of preparation have been pub- 
lished. A simple synthesis utilizing lithium aluminum hy- 
dride is presented in this report. The synthesis may be 
outlined as follows: gallic acid — 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxy ben- 
zoic acid, -methyl ester of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzyl alco- 
hol — 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzyl chloride-3, 4, 5-Tri-, 
methoxyphenylacetonitrile-Mescaline. 
Experimental: 
Methyl Ester of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzoic acid: To 
a solution prepared from 100 g. of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxy- 
benzoic acid (0.47 Mole), 20 g. of sodium hydroxide, 
55 g. of sodium carbonate and 300 ml. of water is added, 
with stirring, 94 ml. of methyl sulfate (0.94 Mole) during 
the course of 20 minutes. The reaction mixture is refluxed 
for one-half hour. The crude ester (65 g., 61% ) precip- 
itates from the cold mixture. From the filtrate, 38 g. of 
starting material is recovered upon acidification with di- 
luted HCL. The ester is further purified by solution in 
the minimum amount of methanol and treatment with 
norite. Usually it is necessary to repeat this treatment to 
obtain a colorless crystalline product that melts at 80-82 
degrees. Semmler, 9 who employed a different process, re- 
ported m.p. 83-84 degrees. 
3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenyl alcohol: To suspension of 
4.6 g. (0.12 Mole) of lithium aluminum hydride in 200 
ml. of anhydrous ether is added, in the course of 30 min- 
utes, a solution of 22.6 g. (0.1 Mole) of the methyl ester 
of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzoic acid in 300 ml. of ether. 
The solid which forms is carefully decomposed first with 
50 ml. of ice-water. After decantation of the ether, 250 
ml. of ice-cold 10% sulfuric acid is added. The product is 
extracted with 150 ml. of ether. The combined extracts, 
after drying over sodium sulfate, are freed of ether and 
the residue distilled; b.p. 135-137 degrees (0.25 mm); 
yield 14.7 g. (73% ). This compound was obtained by a 
different method by Marx; 10 b.p. 228 degrees (25 mm). 
3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzyl chloride: A mixture of 25 
g. of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzyl alcohol and 125 ml. of ice- 
cold concentrated HC1 is shaken vigorously until a homo- 
geneous solution is obtained. In a few minutes a turbid- 
ity develops, followed by a heavy precipitation of gum- 
my product. After 4 hours and dilution with 100 ml. of 
ice-water, the aqueous layer is decanted and extracted 
with three 50 ml. portions of benzene. Then the gummy 
organic residue is dissolved in the combined benzene ex- 
tracts. The benzene solution is washed with water and 
dried over sodium sulfate. 
The benzene solution is transferred to a distilling flask, 
and the benzene is removed under diminished pressure. 
The red semi-solid residue is suspended in a small 
amount of ice-cold ether and filtered through a chilled 
funnel. The crystalline product, after washing with small 
portions of cold ether, weighs 9.7 g. The combined fil- 
trates on standing in refrigerator yield more crystals. The 
total yield is 13.0 g. (48% ) . After four recrystallizations 
from benzene, colorless needles are obtained; m.p. 60-62 
degrees. 
Anal. Calcd. for C„ l H, 3 0,CI: C, 55.42; H, 6.05. 
Found: C, 55.55; H, 6.13. 
This compound js extremely soluble in ether, alcohol 
and acetone, but slightly soluble in petroleum ether. 
Standing at room temperature for a few weeks causes 
the crystals to turn into a red semi-solid. An alcoholic 
solution of pure material .gives an instantaneous pre- 
cipitation with alcoholic silver nitrate. 
3, 4, 5-Trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile — A mixture of 
9 g. of potassium cyanide in 35 ml. of water and 60 ml. 
of methanol and 9.7 g. of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxybenzyl 
chloride is heated for 10 min. at 90 degrees. The sol- 
vents are partially removed under diminished pressure. 
The residue is then extracted with 90 ml. of ether in 
three portions. The combined extracts are washed with 
water and dried over sodium sulfate. After the removal 
of the drying agent, the ether solution is warmed on a 
steam-bath and the ether is removed with a stream of 
air. On chilling, the residue yields scalelike crystals. Re- 
crystallization from ether gives rectangular prism: Yield 
2.5 g. (27% ): m.p. 76-77 degrees. Baker and Robin- 
son 12 reported a melting point of 77 degrees for this com- 
pound. 
Mescaline — In 150 ml. of anhydrous ether is sus- 
pended 0.85 g. of lithium aluminum hydride powder. 
With stirring, 2.0 g. of 3, 4, 5-Trimethoxyphenylaceton- 
itrile in 150 ml. of anhydrous ether was added during 
the course of 15 minutes. After 25 min. stirring, 10 ml. 
of ice-water is dropped in carefully. Then a mixture of 
DRUGS / 49 
10 g. of sulfuric acid in 40 ml. of water is added at a 
moderate rate. The aqueous layer is separated and 
treated with concentrated sodium hydroxide. The brown 
011 is extracted with three portions of 30 ml. each of 
ether. The combined extracts are washed once with 
water and dried over stick potassium hydroxide. To 
the decanted ether solution is added a mixture of 1 g. of 
sulfuric acid and 25 ml. of ether. The white precipitate 
is washed several times with ether; yield 1.2 g. (40%). 
After two re-crystallizations form 95% ethanol, the 
colorless long thin plates soften at 172 degrees and melt 
at 183 degrees. 
A sample of mescaline acid sulfate prepared from the 
natural source and kindly furnished by Dr. Seevers of 
the Department of Pharmacology softens at 170 degrees 
and melts at 180 degrees. The picrate, prepared from 
the acid sulfate, melts at 217 degrees (dec.), after three 
recrystallizations from ethanol. The chloroplatinate 
prepared from free base melts at 184-185 degrees. Spath 
gave the following melting points: sulfate, 183-186 de- 
grees; picrate, 216-218 degrees; chioroptinate, 187-188 
degrees.

Mescaline is very similar to LSD and psilocybin, in that 
the effects tend to disorder the senses. It may create an- 
xiety and slight nausea about two hours after ingestion, but 
as the experience proceeds all the impressions and obser- 
vations of the subject are intensified. Time and space are 
distorted, or completely ignored. A definite change in per- 
ception takes place. Objects may seem as if they are sus- 
pended in a liquid, or a general flowing movement may be 
present. The subject may be very conscious of his ego, and 
a sense of threat and fear may accompany the intensifica- 
tion of colors. 
Mescaline, as with all psychedelics, is a very personal 
experience. It affects every person differently so, in that 
sense, it is impossible for me to try to describe the experi- 
ence. The normal dosage of mescaline is about 500 micro- 
grams, and it may have toxic reactions with an overdose 
of 1000 mics or more. 
Mescaline is a hallucinogenic alkaloid, which is ex- 
tracted from peyote cactus, or can be synthesized in the 
laboratory, as in the previous recipe. The chemical struc- 
ture of mescaline closely resembles STP, which is a much 
stronger psychedelic. The reason black-market distribution 
and sale of mescaline are not more widespread than at 
present is that LSD is considered five thousand times more 
powerful with almost the same effects. Mescaline is also 
slightly more expensive than acid; a cap of mescaline 
usually goes for between $5 and $7, whereas you should 
have no trouble finding a good cap of acid for $3 or $4. 
My ideas of space were very unusual [under the influ- 
ence of mescaline]. I could see myself from head to foot 
as well as the sofa on which I was lying. All else was 
nothing, absolutely empty space. I was on a solitary 
island floating in ether. No part of my body was subject 
to the laws of gravitation. On the other side of the vacu- 
um, the room seemed to be unlimited in space — ex- 
tremely fantastic figures appeared before my eyes. I was 
very excited, perspired and shivered, and was kept in 
a state of ceaseless wonder. I saw endless passages with 
beautiful pointed arches, delightfully colored ara- 
besques, grotesque decorations, divine, sublime and en- 
chanting in their fantastic splendor. These visions 
changed in waves and billows, were built, destroyed and 
appeared again in endless variations, first on one plane 
and then in three dimensions, at last disappearing in in- 
finity. The sofa-island disappeared; I did not feel my 
self; an ever-increasing feeling of dissolution set in. I

was seized with passionate curiosity, great things were 
about to be unveiled before me. I would perceive the 
essence of all things, the problems of creation would be 
unravelled. I was dematerialized. 
Louis Lewin (1964) 
Psilocybin 
Psilocybin, like mescaline, is extracted from a plant. 
Psilocybin is extracted from Psilocybe mexicana, a small 
mushroom that grows in wet or marshy pastures. Other 
species of mushrooms which have psychedelic qualities are: 
Conocybe siliginoides, Psilocybe azXecorum, P. zapotecor- 
um, P. caerulescens , and Stropharia cubertis. 
Psilocybin, like peyote, was and is still used to a small 
degree in the religious rites of the Mexican Indians. It was 
referred to as teonanactl, or in English as God’s flesh. The 
Indians usually eat between 10 and 15 mushrooms, which, 
like peyote, have a very unpleasant acrid smell. Usually 
nausea follows ingestion. The effects of psilocybin last for 
about five to seven hours. 
When you take the actual raw mushrooms, the dosage 
is about 10 to 20 medium-sized buttons. A faster method 
of ingestion is to prepare a soup, using any regular mush- 
room soup recipe. Although this tends to increase the speed 
in which the psilocybin enters the blood stream, it also in- 
creases the unpleasant taste and smell. When taking syn- 
thesized psilocybin, usually a capsule of between 20 and 
60 milligrams will produce a four- to six-hour trip. 
How to grow psilocybe mushrooms in the kitchen 
The recipe for growing these mushrooms follows on the 
next page. It is simple enough that anyone should be able 
to perform it in his kitchen. 
Recipe for groicing psilocybe mushrooms: 
It is important, in working with fungi, to use “pure-cul- 
ture” technique to prevent the fungi one is working with 
from becoming contaminated with unwanted air-borne 
fungi. This pure-culture technique is easily acquired by 
reading the chapters devoted to it in any introductory bac- 
teriology laboratory manual. Better yet, anyone who has 
had a course in bacteriology can easily demonstrate the 
technique of transferring the fungi and making the neces- 
sary “inoculating loop,” which is used to transfer the fungi 
from one tube or bottle to another without getting the 
material contaminated. 
DRUGS / 51 
The careful handling of the fungi psilocybe is most im- 
portant, as the psilocybe are easily overgrown and ruined 
by other molds present in the normal environment. The 
material on which the fungi is grown is called the “medi- 
um” or “media.” Preparation of the medium varies some- 
what according to the kind used, but in general the pro- 
cedure is the same. Briefly the ingredients are weighed 
(great accuracy is not generally required), dissolved in the 
required amount of water (distilled), and distributed into 
containers for sterilizing. The use of pint or quart fruit jars, 
with the jar mouth covered with a heavy gauze aluminum 
foil, is adequate. 
Inasmuch as media are prepared to grow the fungi in 
pure culture, all microorganisms, other than the one to be 
grown, must be excluded. This makes it necessary to steril- 
ize the medium before using it, to kill any bacteria or fun- 
gus spores which are present in the medium or on the glass- 
ware. Sterilization is accomplished by placing the contain- 
ers with the medium into a pressure cooker, preferably the 
canning type with a pressure gauge, and sterilizing, (called 
“autoclaving”) for 15 to 20 minutes at 250 degrees. Allow 
the pressure cooker to come down in pressure very slowly 
or the medium will boil over. 
Quart fruit jars should not be filled with more than two 
cups of any medium used; the pint jars with not over three- 
fourths of a cup. 
Media which contain sugar (glucose, sucrose, maltose, 
etc.) may caramelize somewhat if heating is continued 
beyond 20 minutes at 250 degrees F. This caramelization 
may be toxic to the fungi and they will fail to grow, or will 
grow but little, or no psilocybin will be produced. 
After preparation and sterilization, it is well to leave 
media at room temperature for about three days without 
opening them, as a check to see if the medium is really 
sterile. If any growth of fungi occurs, or a film of bacteria 
forms across the medium (usually seen or smelled), the 
sterilization process is faulty. In the latter case, discard 
the medium. No medium can be satisfactorily resterilized 
for culturing psilocybe. 
In order to have a medium on which to maintain the 
fungi over long periods of time, it is well to prepare some 
tubes of medium which contain agar as a solidifying agent. 
The most satisfactory tubes are those about six inches long 
and a half inch in diameter with screw caps having rubber 
liners (obtainable from any lab supply source). Fill the 
tubes one-third full of agar medium (after melting the agar 
— see formulae), sterilize, and cool to room temperature 
to solidify the agar. Inoculate the fungi into the water with 
sterilized inoculating loop, as required by pure-culture tech- 
nique. These tubes are held at room temperature for a few 
days — even a week — or until there is a growth of the fungi 
over the surface. The caps are screwed down tight and 
the cultures are stored at refrigerator temperature. This con- 
stitutes your “stock cultures” and is the source for inoculat- 
ing larger quantities of the medium. The use of stock cul- 
tures insures a constant supply of viable, uncontaminated 
culture material. The psilocybe will keep up to a year at re- 
frigerator temperature without being transferred to a new 
medium. 
The larger bottles of medium are inoculated with a small 
amount of the whitish thread of the fungi (the threads are 
called “mycelium”), using careful pure-culture technique. 
Leave the culture at room temperature — about 70 to 75 de- 
grees. This is easily maintained if one has a cellar; or one 
may have a refrigerator man put a thermostat in an ordin- 
ary refrigerator so as to maintain the needed temperature 
range. The psilocybe fungi will grow at a higher temperature, 
but the psilocybin production will be low or none. 
It is not necessary to obtain the mushroom form of the 
fungi (called fruiting bodies, or carpophores) in order to 
have psilocybin production carried out. The mycelium con- 
tains as much as the fruiting bodies. When the mushroom 
threads have grown in the medium for about 10 to 12 days, 
they should be harvested. (This time is the most variable 
factor in obtaining the maximum yield of psilocybin. Trial 
and error under individual conditions of growth is neces- 
sary to standardize the yield. Keeping careful records of the 
medium used, how prepared, and temperature and time will 
allow one to improve the yield with practice.) Scientifically, 
harvesting is done just about four days after the last of the 
sugar has been used by the fungi. Harvesting is done by re- 
moving the medium: liquid medium by filtering through 
flannel and keeping the mycelium mat; solid medium by 
simply removing the mycelium mat. The mycelium, which 
may be a gooey mess, is dried at very low heat (not over 200 
degrees F. in an oven with the door slightly ajar). Powder 
the dried material. The powder may be extracted by soaking 
in methanol, filtering, and evaporating the liquid with a low 
heat. Do this in a ventilated room, and be sure all the me- 
thanol is gone. 
There will be psilocybin in the medium also, but it is gen- 
erally in small amounts and not worth the effort to extract it. 
52 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
The above procedure may seem complicated, but after 
a few tries it is rather straightforward. Psilocybin produc- 
tion is dependent upon a lot of factors which are not yet 
all known. There is no way but trial and error in develop- 
ing media and methods. This recipe is taken directly from 
The Turn-On Book, BarNel Enterprises. 
Psilocybe cubensis grows and fruits readily on potato 
dextrose, yeast, or rye grain medium; however Psilocybe 
mexicana will grow and fruit on potato dextrose but not 
on the rye grain medium. 
Recipe for potato dextrose yeast agar: 
1. Wash 250 grams potatoes (do not peel). 
2. Slice Vs inch thick. 
3. Wash with tap water until water is clear. 
4. Drain, rinse with distilled water. 
5. Cover with distilled water and cook until tender. 
6. Drain liquid through flannel cloth or several thick- 
nesses of cheesecloth into a flask or jar. 
7. Rinse potatoes once or twice with a little distilled 
water. 
8. Keep liquid and throw potatoes away — add enough 
distilled water to make up one liter of liquid. 
9. Bring liquid to a boil, and add 15 grams agar and stir 
until dissolved (watch carefully or it will boil over — 
best to use a stainless steel pan), 10 grams dextrose, 
and 1 .5 grams yeast extract. 
10. While liquid is hot, distribute into desired containers. 
11. Autoclave for 15 minutes at 250 degrees F. (about 
15 lbs. pressure). 
12. PDY broth is made the same way but without the 
sugar. 
Recipe for rye grain medium: 
For half-pint jars: 
50 grams rye grain (whole) 
80 ml. water 
1 gram chalk (calcium carbonate) 
For pint jars: 
100 grams rye grain (whole) 
160 ml. water 
2 grams of chalk (calcium carbonate) 
For quart jars: 
225 grams rye grain (whole) 
275 ml. water 
4 grams chalk (calcium carbonate) 
Note: If rye grain medium seems dry, add small amounts 
of distilled water. 
How to make synthetic psilocybin in the laboratory 
The next recipe is for the synthesis of psilocybin. It is 
the last technical recipe in the book, since this book is not 
directed at chemistry majors. To understand and perform 
this recipe, you need a basic understanding of chemistry 
and access to a laboratory.

DMT 
How to make DMT in the kitchen 
DMT stands for N,N-dimethyltryptamine. DMT is a 
semisynthetic compound similar to psilocin in structure. 
(Psilocin is the hallucinogenic substance based in psilocy- 
bin. ) DMT is extremely fast-acting. Within several minutes 
54 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
of ingestion, the effects can be felt, but it doesn’t last as 
long as other psychedelics. The intensity, on the other 
hand, is as strong; for about 30 to 45 minutes you are 
completely under the influence of this drug. The most 
common method of ingestion is smoking, but I have heard 
that there were some capsules around for about two years. 
Whether they were good or not, I have no idea. Carefully 
soaked parsley leaves are the usual medium for smoking, 
although some persons have dipped marihuana in it and 
said the experience was fantastic. Other compounds sim- 
ilar to DMT are both DET and DPT. 
The next recipe is for DMT. It is very simple and can 
easily be performed in the kitchen. All the chemicals and 
equipment are available from any chemical supply house or 
hobby shop. 
Recipe for DMT: 
1. Mix thoroughly and dissolve 25 grams of indole with 
a pound of dry ethyl ether in a 2,000-ml. flask (two-quart 
jar). 
2. Take ice tray and fill with chipped or shaved ice. 
Now cool solution for about 35 minutes until it reaches the 
temperature of 0 degrees C. At the same time cool 50 ml. 
of dry oxalychloride to about 5 degrees below 0 degrees C. 
in the same ice tray. 
3. Very slowly add the oxalychloride solution to the in- 
dole solution. 
Warning: When these two chemicals are mixed together, 
there is an extremely violent reaction. Avoid boiling over, 
avoid contact with skin, and avoid fumes. 
4. Wait until all the bubbling has died down, then add a 
few handfuls of common table salt to the ice tray, to cool 
the solution further. Put this solution aside and label it 
“solution 1.” 
5. Cool 100 ml. of dry ethyl ether, in a 500-ml. flask, to 
0 degrees C. in a salted ice tray. At the same time cool an 
unopened 100-gram bottle of dimethylamine to 0 degrees 
C. in the same ice bath. 
6. Open the seal of the dimethylamine bottle and slow- 
ly pour a steady stream into the ether. Label “solution 2.” 
7. Very slowly and carefully add solution “1” and “2” 
together. 
8. Now take the mixed solutions from the ice tray and 
bring up to room temperature, stirring the solution all the 
time. You should be left with a solution which is almost 
clear. If it is still murky, continue stirring until it becomes 
as clear as possible. 
9. Now filter the solution to separate the precipitate by 
suction, as shown in Figure 7. 
Figure 7. Primary filtering of homemade DMT. 
10. Refilter with suction after pouring technical ether 
over the precipitate. 
1 1 . Repeat filtering once more with ether and then twice 
with water. 
12. Let this substance dry on a plastic or china plate. 
(Do not use metal.) After drying, a solid material will be 
formed. Take these particles and place them in a 800-ml. 
beaker. 
13. Mix 100 ml. benzene with 100 ml. methyl alcohol. 
After the mixture has been stirred, cover solid particles 
from step 1 2 with about a half inch of the solution and heat 
the beaker in water until all solid material has dissolved. 
Add more solvent if necessary. See Figure 8 below. 
Heat Source Figure 8. Heating DMT solution in water bath. 
DRUGS / 55 
14. After all the solid material has dissolved, remove 
beaker from the heat, and allow it to cool. As it cools, small 
needle-shaped crystals will appear. When this happens, try 
to pour off as much of the solvent as possible without dis- 
turbing the crystals. 
15. Place crystals in a 1,000-ml. flask and dissolve in 
tetrahydrofurane. (Use only as much as absolutely neces- 
sary.) Label this solution “A.” 
16. Slowly mix 200 ml. tetrahydrofurane and 20 grams 
lithium aluminum hydride in a 500-ml. flask, and label it 
solution “B.” 
Warning: Lithium aluminum hydride ignites on contact 
with moisture. Do not use on humid days. Protect eyes and 
wear rubber gloves. 
17. Mix solutions “A” and “B” slowly, stirring con- 
stantly. 
1 8. Prepare a water bath and heat solution in water bath 
for three hours, stirring for four minutes every half hour. 
When not stirring, use aspirator tube as shown in Figure 
One-Hole Rubber Stopper 
and Glass Tubing 
Several Feet of 
Rubber Tubing 
Figure 9. Final collection of DMT. 
19. When this is completed, allow the flask to remain at 
room temperature for about 20 minutes. Then place in 
salted ice bath and cool to 0 degrees C. Add a small 
amount of chilled methanol, stirring gently until solution 
appears murky. 
20. Filter this murky solution through a paper filter in 
a funnel, and collect the filtered liquid in a flask. 
21. Add 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran through the filter 
and collect in the same flask. Now heat this solution in a 
water bath until most of the tetrahydrqfuran is evaporated 
and a gooey substance remains. 
22. Place little piles of this substance on a cookie tray 
and, with a heat lamp, dry for three or four hours. Now 
you have D.M.T. To ingest, crumble a small quantity with 
parsley or mint, and smoke. Do not inject. Do not smoke 
with tobacco. DMT is a powerful psychedelic and should 
not be abused. 
Author’s note: All chemicals in the last recipe can be 
ordered by mail from any of the large chemical manufac- 
turers. Lithium aluminum hydride may be ordered from 
Metal Hydrides Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts (it costs 
about $20 per 100 grams). All other chemicals can be 
ordered from Van Water-Rogers. 
Bananas 
Believe it or not, bananas do contain a small quantity of 
Musa Sapientum bananadine, which is a mild, short-lasting 
psychedelic. There are much easier ways of getting high, 
but the great advantage to this method is that bananas are 
legal. 
1. Obtain 15 lbs. of ripe yellow bananas. 
2. Peel all 15 lbs. and eat the fruit. Save the peels. 
3. With a sharp knife, scrape off the insides of the peels 
and save the scraped material. 
4. Put all scraped material in a large pot and add water. 
Boil for three to four hours until it has attained a solid 
paste consistency. 
5. Spread this paste on cookie sheets, and dry in an oven 
for about 20 minutes to a half hour. This will result in a 
fine black powder. Makes about one pound of bananadine 
powder. Usually one will feel the effects of bananadine after 
smoking three or four cigarettes.

Amphetamines 
Amphetamines act as a stimulant on the central nervous 
system. They do not produce energy as food does, but 
rather put into action energy that is already present in the 
body. Amphetamines are broken down chemically into 
three types: salts of racemic amphetamines, dextroam- 
56 / THE ANARCHHST COOKBOOK 
phetamines, and meth amphetamines, which only differ in 
potencies. Amphetamine, or speed, is used medically to 
combat chronic depression, as it does give the user a feel- 
ing of euphoria, while controlling his appetite. 
On the black market, amphetamine is usually sold in one 
of two ways, either in a pill form (benzedrine, dexedrine, 
desbutal, desoxyn, or dexamyl) or as a crystalline powder 
(methedrine). Methedrine is usually injected, although it 
can be snorted (sniffed) or eaten in small quantities. Speed 
usually sells for about 10 to 25 cents a pill depending on 
potency, or in nickel bags and spoons of methedrine which 
comes in a tiny wax paper envelope. 
Amphetamine does not cause addiction; but it is habit- 
forming, and a definite tolerance is built up to it, causing 
one to increase dosages. After a long period of time, 
usage will cause paranoia and real mental disorientation; 
this is especially true with methedrine. A heavy ampheta- 
mine scene, whether it be with pills or crystal is just as bad 
as, if not worse than, a heroin scene. 
There are several methods of obtaining pills or ups. 
The first and easiest is to find a friend who is overweight 
and get him to go to a doctor for diet pills, as most diet 
pills are amphetamines. The best place in the world to buy 
benzedrine, or any of the rest of the amphetamines, is a 
Mexican border town, where every cab driver has his own 
stash, but this does entail bringing the stuff across the 
border, which can be a bad scene. 
Any person can go to a doctor and claim he sleeps all 
the time — that he just can’t stay awake. There is a great 
probability that the doctor will prescribe amphetamines. If 
you manage to get hold of prescription blanks, be very 
careful in filling them out, as pharmacists are watchful for 
mistakes and often go into the back and call the doctor on 
the phone if they feel suspicious. Another excellent way to 
obtain pills is to become friendly with a nurse or intern at a 
large hospital. Although they wouldn’t be able to get you 
quantities, this method is probably the safest. 
Description of amphetamines: 
Benzedrine: A flat, pink, heart-shaped tablet, and in 10- 
milligram white tablets with a groove down the center. 
There are some time-release 15-milligram capsules. 
Biphetamine: These are sold in 12-milligram capsules 
with a black top and a white bottom. The 20-milligram 
capsule is all black, and the 7-milligram capsule is all 
white. They are all inscribed with either “RJD or RJS.” 
The manufacturer’s recommended dose is one capsule 
daily. 
Desbutal: These are sold in 5-milligram green capsules, 
10-milligram pink and blue tablets, 15-milligram yellow 
and blue tablets. The manufacturer’s recommended dosage 
is one 5-milligram capsule two or three times daily, or one 
of the 10- or 15-milligram tablets once in the morning. 
Dexamyl: Dexamyl combines an amphetamine stimulant 
with a barbiturate depressant, to counteract the ampheta- 
mine side effects (i.e., nervousness). Dexamyl is sold in 
spansules, which have a green cap and a clear body show- 
ing green and white pellets. They are also sold in 5-milli- 
gram green heart-shaped tablets, with a groove down the 
center. In Great Britain they are sold as Drinamyl (purple 
hearts). 
Methedrine: Methedrine is sold in 5-milligram white 
tablets with a center groove, or in ampules for injections 
containing 20 milligrams. Most common, on the black mar- 
ket, is crystal meth, which is powdered methedrine, usually 
cut with something else (powdered sugar or baking soda) . 
Amyl Nitrate 
Amyl nitrate is sold in small glass capsules, and is only 
effective when inhaled. It is used medically for the treat- 
ment of heart attack victims. When the glass is broken, the 
user quickly inhales the fumes. It takes only a second to 
take effect, but it only lasts for two to three minutes. It is 
a very strong drug, and has the quality of prolonging sex- 
ual orgasms. It is sold in most states without a prescription. 
Overindulgence may lead to a headache or nausea, but 
poisoning is very rare. 
Cough Syrup 
Now this is a really strange scene. With all the pot and 
other dope going around, some people still insist on drink- 
ing cough syrup to get high. Robitussin A-C can be pur- 
chased without a prescription, but you may have to sign 
for it in New York. It contains a small quantity of codeine, 
pheniramine, maleate, and glyceryl guaiacolate (a muscle 
relaxant). The effects are sedation and euphoria. The most 
common method of ingestion is to mix Robitussin A-C 
with an equal amount of ginger ale and drink. Never under- 
estimate the potency of any drug. You can have an over- 
dose of cough syrup. 
DRUGS / 
57 
Barbiturates 
Barbiturates are basically the opposite of amphetamines: 
that is, they act to depress the central nervous system. In 
small doses they act as tranquilizers, but in larger doses they 
are sleeping pills. The sleep induced by barbiturates is not 
a normal sleep, in the sense that it seriously cuts down on 
the normal dream activity. Prolonged use of sleeping pills 
can lead to complete psychological crack-ups, as the mind 
has no way to release itself. Barbiturates are often a means 
of comitting suicide. Therefore, as with all drugs, know 
what you are doing. 
The barbiturate addict presents a shocking spectacle. He 
cannot coordinate, he staggers, falls off bar stools, goes 
to sleep in the middle of sentences, food drops out of his 
mouth. He is confused, quarrelsome and stupid. 
William Burroughs, Naked Lunch 
Types of Barbiturates: 
Luminal: Fatal dpsage is about 800 to 1,000 milligrams. 
Luminal is considered a strong long-acting barbiturate. It 
is usually sold in purple (16-milligram), white (32-milli- 
gram), or green (100-milligram) grooved tablets. 
Amytal: This is also considered a strong long-acting 
barbiturate. A heavy dose is between 100 and 250 milli- 
grams. Amytal is sold in light green (15-milligram), yel- 
low (30-milligram), orange (50-milligram), and pink 
(100-milligram) capsule-shaped scored tablets, with 
“Lilly” inscribed in the different colors listed above. 
Amytal Sodium: Very similar to the above amytal, but 
is sold in light blue capsules with a darker band of blue 
where the upper and lower parts meet. Same dosage as 
above. 
Butisol Sodium: Butisol is sold in flat green, orange, 
pink, or lavender tablets inscribed with “McNeil.” A heavy 
dose is 150 milligrams. 
Nembutal: Nembutal is a short-acting barbiturate with 
sedative and hypnotic effects. A heavy dose of nembutal 
or “yellow jackets” is about 200 milligrams. This, as with 
all barbiturates, is extremely dangerous when taken, if the 
liver is infected or impaired. Nembutal is sold in 30-milli- 
gram all-yellow capsules, with an “a” on the bottom part; 
50-milligram capsules with yellow caps and white bottoms 
with an “a” on the bottom part; and 100-milligram all-yel- 
low capsules with the word “Abbott” inscribed. 
Seconal: Seconal is probably the most popular black- 
market barbiturate, as it is very popular with doctors. It is 
referred to as “red devils, red birds, or reds,” because of 
the color of the capsules. It is sold in 32-milligram red 
capsules, and a heavy dose is about 150 milligrams. 
Librium: Librium is a minor tranquilizer, and the usual 
recommended dosage is from 5 to 15 milligrams three or 
four times a day. This is one of the easiest depressants to 
obtain, as doctors tend to prescribe it for anything front 
sleeplessness to acute nervousness. It is sold in 5-milligram 
green and yellow capsules inscribed “Roche 5,” 10-milli- 
gram brown and green capsules inscribed “Roche 10,” and 
25-milligram green and white capsules inscribed “Roche 
25.” 
Valium: This is also a minor tranquilizer, with the rec- 
ommended dosage being about 5 to 10 milligrams, two to 
three times a day. It is sold in white 2-milligram and yellow 
5-milligram tablets inscribed with the word “Roche.” 
Thorazine: This is a very strong drug. It is classified as 
a major tranquilizer and should be used with the utmost 
care. Thorazine is used at such hellholes as Bellevue to 
keep mental patients quiet. The usual recommended dosage 
is about 25 milligrams. It has been used in the treatment of 
bad acid trips. However, as I stated earlier, I feel that 
thorazine will quiet a person down, but has no regard for 
when he wakes up. I would not recommend its use. 
I’ve never tried this one, but a close friend of mine 
from Texas swears by it. Apparently he learned it while he 
was going to school near the Rio Grande and there was an 
overabundance of desert toads. In the skins of toads there 
is a substance called “bufotenine,” which is a hallucinogen. 
Procedure for isolating bufotenine from toad skins 
1. Collect five to ten toads. Make sure they’re toads, as 
frogs will not work. The best kind are tree toads. 
2. Kill them as painlessly as possible, and skin immedi- 
ately. 
3. Allow the skins to dry in a refrigerator for four to five 
days, or until the skins are brittle. 
4. Now crush into a powder and smoke. (Due to its bad 
taste, it should be mixed with mint or some other fragrant 
smoking medium.)

5. Enjoy yourself, it’s legal, but pray there’s not rein- 
carnation. 
Glue 
I don’t understand how anyone would want to sniff glue, 
when just as legally they could smoke toad skins. Glue 
sniffing is really a bad scene, as it causes headaches, con- 
fusion, depression, lack of appetite, nausea, and in larger 
doses coma and death. It has also been attributed to much 
irreparable brain damage. 
The method in which it is “normally” sniffed is as fol- 
lows: Place half a tube of airplane glue (do not use library 
paste) or any carbon tetrachloride-based liquid in a plastic 
bag. Then stick your head inside and inhale. The effects 
only last between 45 minutes and an hour, but during that 
time the individual can undergo disordering of his coordin- 
ation, double vision, and even some not so “groovy” hal- 
lucinations. The person usually falls into a drunken-like 
stupor, but some people have been known to react vio- 
lently. 
Nalline 
This is a freak — a drug someone forgot to make illegal. 
It is used mostly to combat the overdose effects of a strong- 
er narcotic, but it can, in small doses of five to ten milli- 
grams, produce a relaxed feeling, similar to marihuana. In 
large doses it can have adverse effects, and may produce 
anxiety, hallucinations, and nausea. It is available without 
a prescription in most states, but it should be treated care- 
fully, as it is still a powerful drug. 
Cocaine 
Cocaine is, in a pure form, a crystal white powder, which 
is usually sniffed or injected, as much of its potency is lost 
when taken by mouth. Since shooting or injecting any drug 
is one of the worst scenes imaginable, I will not get into it 
at all. Sniffing coke or cocaine is a unique experience. It 
works on the central nervous system as a stimulant in 
order to produce euphoric excitement and in some cases 
hallucinations. 
Heroin 
This is about the worst scene available. Junkies are like 
trapped animals— desperate, wounded wild animals — 
who will do or perform any act to get bread for some shit. 
If you are really interested in this shit, and think it’s cool, 
take a trip to 70th Street and Broadway in New York City 
and wander around a little bit. If you’re not turned off to 
it right away, there’s something basically wrong with you 
to begin with. 
It is possible to shoot; heroin several times before one 
feels the actual addiction, but the withdrawal is pretty ter- 
rible, and usually the place is pretty bad where it takes 
place — that is, the Tombs or Riker’s Island. 
Nutmeg 
Nutmeg can be used for a psychedelic experience, since 
it does contain the ingredient elemicin, which has hallucin- 
atory properties. This recipe cannot be compared to the 
one for rotten peppers published in the East Village Other, 
as nutmeg does work mildly, whereas rotten peppers only 
smell bad. 
Method for the preparation of nutmeg: 
1. Take several whole nutmegs and grind them up in a 
coffee grinder. You will never again be able to use the 
grinder without smelling nutmeg, so use an old one. 
2. After the nutmegs are completely ground, place in a 
mortar and pulverize with a pestle. 
3. The usual dosage is about 10 or 15 grams, Vs to Vi 
an ounce. A larger dose than this may produce excessive 
thirst, anxiety, and rapid heartbeat, but hallucinations are 
rare. 
Paregoric 
Paregoric is tincture of opium and camphor in a com- 
bined solution, medically used in controlling diarrhea. It 
is not used today as much as it was in the I920’s and 30’s, 
but it is still available in many states without a prescription. 
It can be drunk — usually about a pint — or cigarettes can 
be dipped in it and left to dry, then smoked. It does act as 
a constipator, and this should be taken into account before 
use. 
Peanut* 
This is another recipe that I have never tried. It was 
given to me by the same friend who gave me the one using 
toad skins. It may work, it may not, but it’s worth a try, 
since it’s legal. 
DRUGS 
59 
1. Take one pound of raw peanuts (not roasted). 
2. Shell them, saving the skins and discarding the shells. 
3. Eat the nuts. 
4. Grind up the skins and roll them into a cigarette, and 
smoke. 
Hydrangea leaves 
There has been much talk about hydrangea leaves and 
their psychedelic qualities. You can get high from smoking 
hydrangea leaves, but they are a deadly poison and have 
been known to kill people. Do not smoke or ingest in any 
other fashion. 
Treat drugs with respect, moderation, and common sense 
One last word on drugs, because I feel that I may have 
created some confusion as to the actual use of drugs. They 
should be used as an experience in life, rather than making 
the experience itself outside the bounds of being. Treat 
drugs the same way a normal person treats alcohol — with 
respect, with moderation, and with basic common sense. 
Make it a rule not to take any capsules without first look- 
ing them up in a reference book to confirm exactly what 
they are. An excellent book on this is The Drug Takers, 
published by Time-Life, which includes pictures of all the 
common pills and capsules. 
Avoid shooting or injecting any drug into yourself, and, 
for God’s sake, have the common sense not to allow any- 
one else to do it. More cases of young people with hepa- 
titis are brought into Bellevue every day just because of 
a lack of common sense. 
Mixing barbiturates and amphetamines usually results 
in an insane, unpleasant experience, although there are 
some freaks who swear by it. Mixing barbiturates with al- 
cohol can also be a bad scene. Most importantly, check 
all the facts before taking any drug. 
Avoid unpleasant company when high on drugs, especi- 
ally acid or mescaline, as sometimes bad company can 
throw an individual into a panic just as easily as he can 
himself. This is also true to a smaller degree with pot. 
Smoke with friends. Some sadistic cocksuckers have been 
known to play incredibly cruel games with an individual’s 
mind while he is stoned. 
If you are in the company of someone who has been 
given an overdose of heroin, do not panic. Walk him, keep 
him active, until you can get him to a doctor or hospital. 
In no circumstances allow him to drift off into a coma. I 
have heard of home remedies, such as injecting a salt solu- 
tion into the person, but I have no medical verification for 
this, and do not recommend it. 
Treat any and all drugs with respect, for most of the 
time they are stronger than you are.

THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK / 61 
62 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
This chapter is designed to explain and discuss an aspect 
of revolution that for the most part everyone has forgotten 
— that being its constructive elements, rather than the blind 
“window-smashing” nihilism that everyone is accustomed 
to. This chapter deals with strategy and tactics. A revolu- 
tion, to be successful, must be a balance between passion 
and practicality. Revolution must employ the maximum 
amount of planning and the minimum amount of violence 
and destruction. Riots, street violence, and demonstrations 
have little place in a real insurrection. It is much harder to 
create than to destroy, and a revolution must be created. 
This chapter does not in any way deal with symbolic 
protest. I detest symbolic protest, as it is an outcry of weak, 
middle-of-the-road, liberal eunuchs. If an individual feels 
strongly enough about something to do something about 
it, then he shouldn’t prostitute himself by doing something 
symbolic. He should get out and do something real. The 
age of demonstrations is over, or at least I hope it’s over. 
It lasted much too long as it was. Three years ago the 
Provos in Holland realized this and completely changed 
their tactics. They moved from the realm of peaceful 
demonstrations to that of guerrilla theater, which included 
rolling ball bearings at mounted police; letting several 
thousand mice, with hammers and sickles painted on their 
backs, loose at the Queen’s birthday party; and threaten- 
ing to pollute Amsterdam’s water supply with LSD, which 
happened to be legal at the time. Such measures are not 
revolutionary in themselves, but the reaction of the military 
and police to these actions causes a growth of revolutionary 
feeling. 
In Prague, during the Russian takeover, there were a 
multitude of underground stations ready to broadcast, there 
was a completely organized revolutionary press, and many 
a cellar was converted into a factory to manufacture Molo- 
tov cocktails and other weapons. Now the question comes 
up: Why is the United States so far behind these countries? 
Or, to phrase it another way: Why are American anarchists 
and revolutionaries more intent on burning flags and draft 
cards, than on employing constructive nonsymbolic tactics, 
which are directed at positive change. I guess one of the 
answers, or maybe part of the answer, is the myth of the 
difficulties in running a government. This idea that running 
a representative government is difficult is bullshit. I agree 
it becomes difficult when conflicts of interest appear on the 
scene, but otherwise it’s as simple as running anything else. 
American youth is frightened of the responsibility of build- 
ing a new government, frightened of themselves, and fright- 
ened most of all by their own potential actions. 
A friend of mine has often said that, when the youth in 
the South feels threatened by the government, then the 
revolution will really be under way. I have come to be- 
lieve him, because in the South there is a great deal more 
feeling toward the community. In other words, the union 
of the rural community has not broken down, as it has in 
the North. In the North the young so-called revolutionaries 
are fighting for ideals, rather than realistic goals. A revolu- 
tion was never fought, throughout history, for ideals. Revo- 
lutions were fought for much more concrete things: food, 
clothes, housing, and to relieve intolerable oppression. The 
real duty of a revolutionary is to create and expose intoler- 
able oppression. The rural South, when it feels that these 
things are in peril, will react quickly and violently, as the;, 
will be fighting for their communities, just like the Black 
Panthers and Young Lords are fighting for their commun- 
ities. The so-called “revolutionary” students in the colleges 
and universities are fighting for abstract ideals. I know of 
no one, outside of Patrick Henry, willing to die for an ab- 
straction. 
The way inflation is rising, and the manner in which the 
president and congress are handling it, can all but insure a 
major depression in the near future. This economic disaster 
will act as a unifying factor, in the sense that those same 
longshoremen and union personnel who are so alienated 
from the youth of today will find themselves fighting right 
next to youth for their very survival. The Black Plague in 
London was ended by the Fire of London. 
Several groups are already attempting to cultivate bonds 
with unions, by supporting strikes and marching on picket 
lines. The only problem with these groups is that they don’t 
understand that they will never get the support of the work- 
ing class while they are shouting Marxist dogma and 
rhetoric. 
In the last few months the newspapers have been full 
of news about the army and G.I.s’ civil liberties. It never 
occurred to the newspapers that some of these men went 
into the army with a single purpose: to create an atmos- 
phere which would invite mutiny and rebellion. The Bol- 
sheviks did exactly the same thing in 1914 and 1915, for 
the easiest way to form a liberation army is to use someone 
else’s, especially if it belongs to your enemy. Many bases 
have created underground newspapers and broadsides 
which show a relatively large degree of freedom of speech. 
ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE, AND SURVEILLANCE / 63 
Many violent and nonviolent outside groups have already 
formed underground railroads to help resisters and desert- 
ers into safe countries. Because of an ingrained fear of 
standing up by oneself, it is obvious that, as the move- 
ment grows, so will the desirability of joining the move- 
ment, and its chances for success. 
The government, with the army’s help, of course, has 
fertilized the development of one of the largest under- 
grounds, in Viet Nam, simply by its oppressive laws re- 
garding the use of marihuana. This oppressive act in itself 
has unified more servicemen than probably all the other 
acts of oppression put together. A government creates its 
own revolution. There can be no revolt without it. 
Freedom is not a commodity which is “given” to the 
enslaved upon demand. It is a precious reward, the shin- 
ing trophy of struggle and sacrifice. 
Kwame Nkrumah, I speak of Freedom 
Electronic bugging devices 
One of the largest problems with any name that sounds 
the least bit technical is that it frightens people to death, 
and they steer completely clear of what they do not under- 
stand. The field of electronic eavesdropping is the simplest 
and one of the cheapest methods of espionage available to 
the movement at this point. 
Any underground movement or truly revolutionary 
group must keep up with the technology of the times. It is 
useless to fight a battle with sticks and stones. There have 
been claims that World War III will not be fought with 
atomic weapons, but rather by computers millions of miles 
apart: The machine that blows its fuse first, loses. Elec- 
tronics play a huge role in the American life style today 
and will play a tremendous part in any type of insurrec- 
tion that is to take place. 
It seems strange that private industry and practically all 
the governmental agencies (not only the FBI and CIA) 
have been employing these tiny devices for years with fan- 
tastic success, without the individuals in the underground 
getting hip to the fact that they could also be used against 
these corporations and agencies with the same degree of 
success. Information is a large part of any movement, as 
without it groups are literally stumbling around in the dark, 
and whatever is accomplished is pure luck. 
When the time comes that the movement needs equip- 
ment and the urban struggle really takes shape, then the 
most obvious place to get this equipment is from the 
enemy. An electronic bug planted today will deliver the 
necessary information, when the time arrives. The loca- 
tion of the enemy is an extremely important thing to know, 
as the time will come when an entire army regiment will 
sweep through a community, and remove many so-called 
suspects for “questioning and detainment.” Just as with 
Auschwitz, the army will provide liberal lawyers, who 
will become safely indignant, and scream, “I’ll get this sit- 
uation straightened out, just as soon as I can find out who’s 
in charge.” 
Any kind of sabotage or ambush activity will be abso- 
lutely pointless without some sort of information as to the 
enemy’s action and movement. This cannot be seen today 
as clearly as it will be seen in the future, as the newspapers 
are still allowed a token degree of freedom. 
Much to our surprise, we found that a large number 
of Federal agencies used wiretapping despite Federal 
laws, State laws, and agency regulations. 
. . . There are miniature microphones, some smaller 
than a thin dime. They can be hidden in any variety of 
ways. There are microphones that can be attached to a 
spike, and driven through the wall of one apartment to 
the plaster wall of the next. There are tube mikes which 
are built into the walls of a building when it is con- 
structed. These gadgets are widely used by private de- 
tectives and industrial and labor spies. Surprising as it 
may seem, they are in no way illegal under federal 
law. 
. . . Bugging conference rooms where taxpayers are 
interviewed, often with their attorneys, is another trick 
employed by the Internal Revenue Service to catch 
suspected tax cheats. 
Senator Edward V. Long, February 2, 1966 
There are several types of electronic eavesdropping or 
bugging devices, and I will handle each in turn. The most 
common form of bug is wiretapping or the monitoring of 
phone conversations. This is the simplest thing for any gov- 
ernmental agency to do, as in most cases it only takes one 
phone call and the officials receive complete cooperation 
from the phone company itself. This is a warning to all 
those who rap a lot over the phone; no one is so small as 
not to be noticed. If what you have to say over the phone 
64 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
cannot be said to a cop, better keep it to yourself. 
On June 17, 1966, State Senator Mario Umana of 
Massachusetts, Chairman of the Massachusetts Commis- 
sion on Electronic Eavesdropping Devices, told a commit- 
tee on eavesdropping that the New England Telephone 
and Telegraph Company was running a system with which 
it monitored every telephone line in Boston over a period 
of more than a year. 
All this may seem very complicated and technical, but in 
reality bugging a telephone is so simple that many school- 
boys do it illegally as a joke on their parents or friends. 
There are many recipes for homemade phone taps, but 
most of these are not really effective, and store-bought 
products are much more efficient and very cheap. 
The easiest way to install a tap is to connect a second 
extension to an already-present phone. This is a very prim- 
itive and outdated method today, as when you pick up 
the receiver there will be a click, and the phone company 
will register an overload on that account. A simple way to 
get around this is to buy a “byphone,” which will allow you 
to listen to the phone conversation without picking up the 
receiver and overloading the phone line. Byphones are sold 
at Continental Telephone Supply for about $10. This de- 
vice is installed by placing it in the slot behind any standard 
desk phone, and listening to the conversation by use of 
the earphone. It is not necessary to lift the arm of the ex- 
tension phone. (See Figure 12.) 
Figure 12. The byphone. 
Maybe even simpler than the last tap is the induction- 
pickup method for monitoring phone conversations. An in- 
ductive pickup is nothing more than a household nail wrap- 
ped with tightly coiled wire and placed alongside the tele- 
phone lines. This homemade method can be effective, but, 
as with the first method, I strongly recommend a store- 
bought device. They usually run about $3 to $5. Most are 
simply connected to the bottom of the phone, with the 
wire leading from the pickup to your headset well con- 
cealed, either in the woodwork or some equally unobtrusive 
place. 
In this same class of induction-pickup probes is what is 
called the “sucker.” This is nothing more than an induc- 
tion-pickup probe in the form of a suction cup, which can 
be attached to any spot on the phone. The sucker is ideal 
for recording messages, as it can be hooked up directly with 
a tape recorder. The “suckers” sell for as little as 88 cents 
through certain mail-order firms listed at the end of the 
chapter. 
The actual wiretapping, that is in the news so much, is 
really as simple as the bugs just mentioned, but it is a little 
more expensive. The “black box” is a line locator which 
enables a person to clip the lines he is interested in and. 
through a transformer, listen to or record the desired con- 
versation. The best location for use of “black boxes” is at 
the telephone junction itself, but they can also be used any- 
where along the phone line. Most individuals who employ 
these boxes usually make their own, as often they are 
nothing more than a transformer, alligator clips, and a set 
of headphones, but you can purchase them from R & S 
Research, Inc., Houston, Texas, for about $35. 
The next form of telephone bug is the line transmitter, 
which transmits, by way of radio waves, the phone con- 
versation you wish to listen to. The great advantage to this 
is that the person doing the tapping never has to enter the 
premises or tamper with the phone. Also, with its tiny size, 
it can be concealed almost anywhere along the phone line 
without too much difficulty. Most of these devices work on 
standard FM bands, and they broadcast anywhere from 
200 feet to a quarter of a mile. I can think of few things as 
funny or irritating to the police department as finding out 
that their own phones were tapped and all their conversa- 
tions were being broadcast over an entire community. 
These little telephone radio line transmitters can be bought 
from several mail order houses for $45 to $60, or the plans 
can be purchased for $2.98 from Tri-Tron, Dallas, Texas. 
These are basically the cheapest and most efficient bugs, 
although there are many more sophisticated devices that 
do all sorts of incredible things. If you’re rich and have a 
little knowledge of electronics, then the whole field of bug- 
ging is wide open for you, as all the major electronics com- 
panies are selling ready-made bugs that can be installed in 
seconds. One of the most popular of these ready-made 
bugs looks exactly like the transmitter in a regular phone. 
It can be installed in less than ten seconds, as the device 
ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE, AND SURVEILLANCE / 65 
simply replaces the phone company’s transmitter. These 
little mechanisms are so good that, in a lot of instances, 
they have even fooled the phone company. They run about 
$200 and are available from either Tri-Tron of Texas or 
from Continental Telephone in New York. 
For the real dodos, pre-bugged telephones are available. 
The installation is nothing more than unplugging the old 
phone and replacing it with the new pre-bugged one. 
( Many professional phone tappers pose as telephone repair 
men.) These pre-bugged phones are sold mainly through 
mail order houses and run about $250. 
The most sophisticated bug I have found available to the 
general public — and who the hell knows what the govern- 
ment has? — is what is called “The Infinity Transmitter.” 
This is a device that allows the individual to dial any num- 
ber, regardless of distance, and, through an electronic tone 
oscillator, deactivate the ring, thereby allowing the tapper 
to hear anything within earshot of the phone without the 
instrument being taken off the hook. These little wonders 
of our age sell for about $ 1 ,000, but I think some compan- 
ies offer a discount. 
What is really ironic is that people are only slowly re- 
alizing that telephone tapping is actually going on. I have 
spoken to some people who have just recently been busted 
for drugs, and they are genuinely confused. They just seem 
unable to understand why the cops chose their apartment 
to raid. If you deal dope on the phone and live in an area 
like Harlem or the Lower East Side, you’re a fool and you 
deserve to get busted. 
When I was living on St. Mark’s Place with a friend, we 
had a feeling our phone was upped, but had no proof until 
one day when my friend went to make a phone call. Some- 
how those mechanical geniuses had screwed up the tap, 
and we had a direct line to the desk sergeant at the 9th 
precinct. Needless to say, it caused many hours of amuse- 
ment. 
In the same class as telephone taps, and probably more 
dangerous, are the undercover cops and FBI men who 
infiltrate activist groups. It’s really getting to the point 
where you don’t know whom to trust. One point about an 
undercover cop in New York City, which does not apply 
to FBI men, is that most of them have beards but short 
hair. This is because the piam-dothes man is often trans- 
ferred around the city and, if he managed to grow long 
hair, how would it look in Queens? On the other hand, 
FBI men are usually on the job for much longer periods 
of time and are able more fully to don their disguises. If 
you think you know a plain-clothes cop, do yourself a 
favor and stay clear of him and warn your friends about 
him. If you’ve got the guts, you can have a great deal of 
fun, since you know he’s a pig, but he doesn’t know that 
you know. The East Village Other, The Rat, and The 
Berkeley Tribe have all been very good over a period of 
time, in publishing pictures of undercover cops. 
During the revolution in Ireland, the British used a very 
brutal and cruel form of terrorism to subdue the popula- 
tion. Although the idea of terrorism revolted the Irish 
Republican Army, they resorted to it as a last measure 
against the British, and it worked. There was an under- 
standing in the Irish Republican Army that for every farm- 
er who was killed by the British, two English civilians 
would die. For every farmhouse burned to the ground by 
the British, two Loyalists’ houses would be burned. The 
British decided to stop their terrorist tactics. 
The same type of terrorism is being practiced in every 
ghetto of this country today, and it is my firm belief that 
the only way to stop it is to show everyone what terrorism 
is all about, and that two can play at the same game. 
Microphones 
The choice of microphones for eavesdropping is an in- 
teresting one, as many different types are made, and cer- 
tain ones will not be as effective as others. The microphone 
must be small enough to be hidden easily, and at the same 
time powerful enough to pick up whispers at 20 feet. These 
microphones can then be rigged up to voice-activated tape 
recorders, basic audio amplifiers, or any radio frequency 
transmitter. 
There are several basic types of microphones, and all 
have disadvantages. Try to stay away from listening devices 
that depend on batteries for their power supply, as nearly 
always the batteries will die out at the important moment 
in the conversation. Probably the most important rule for 
bugging or telephone tapping is not to try to retrieve the 
bug after it is placed, as more buggers get caught this way 
than any other. Many professional tappers and buggers 
have learned that using two microphones instead of one is 
a good safeguard against one failing, but at the same time 
it increases the chances of someone discovering it. 
The first and probably most common type of micro- 
phone is what is called the “carbon” button. These contain 
fine granules of carbon between thin plates of the dia- 
66 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
phragm; as the sound strikes the diaphragm, this in turn 
compresses and decompresses the carbon, thus regulating 
the amounts of electricity passing through it (See Figure 
13). These carbon buttons are used in telephones and in 
many microphones for cheaper tape recorders. There are a 
few disadvantages to this type of microphone; carbon but- 
tons are not sensitive enough to pick up sounds over 15 
feet away. They also require large amounts of power. 
^ 
Sound 
Figure 13. The carbon button. 
Carbon Buttons 
The second type of microphone device is called the Cry- 
stal Microphone, because it employs the use of certain 
crystals. This is a good type of microphone because it does 
not need external voltage, as the crystal when subjected to 
pressure creates its own voltage. They are also pretty sensi- 
tive, but should be hooked up to an amplifier. The only real 
disadvantage in this type is that they are relatively unstable 
when used out of doors, and even indoor temperature 
changes can render them useless. They can, on the other 
hand, be bought for as little as 50 cents through certain 
mail order firms. 
Figure 14. Crystal Microphone. 
ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE, AND SURVEILLANCE / 
67 
The third type of microphone is the “dynamic micro- 
phone,” which is probably the most efficient and stable. It 
is nothing more than a loudspeaker operating in reverse. 
It is a rugged microphone and is sensitive, but it usually 
needs additional amplification. 
Diaphragm 
There are too many different types of mikes manu- 
factured to go into all of them, but the ones most suitable 
for bugging and espionage work will be discussed here. 
Some of the most popular ones are listed and pictured in 
the Continental catalogue. There is the sugar cube mike, 
which looks like a sugar cube. There are mikes that re- 
semble ball-point pens. There are buttonhole mikes, which 
appear to be nothing more than a button. There are mikes 
manufactured within the mechanisms of watches. There are 
even entire units, consisting of microphone, amplifier, and 
recorder that are small enough to fit in a cigarette pack. 
The best bet is to shop around the catalogues with your 
various needs in mind. Undoubtedly you will find some- 
thing that will meet your requirements. 
There are two other snooping devices which I feel must 
be mentioned — mainly because they remind me of the 
“media myth” of the cloak-and-dagger and round-bomb- 
type anarchist. The first is the notorious “Snake,” which is 
Buttonhole Mike

(effective but large) 
Suction-cup Wall Listner 
the latest electronic device for keyhole listening. It is 
equipped with a long nose which can be easily put into any 
crack or keyhole, or even unreeled out a window. It can 
be obtained from Tri-Tron in Texas for about $40. 
The other cloak-and-dagger listening device is what is 
called the “electronic stethoscope.” This is probably the 
most popular of all room-to-room listening devices. It 
hears and penetrates through thick walls, carpets, floors, 
and can record entire conversations by plugging it into any 
tape recorder. There is virtually no way of detecting this 
type of gismo. They can be purchased from Consolidated 
Acoustics for as little as $13.00.

Bumper beepers 
Ever since the movie Goldfinger, where superspy James 
Bond follows supercriminal Goldfinger around Europe, 
everyone has been talking about “bumper beepers. These 
bumper beepers are ordinary bugging transmitters which, 
instead of sending out voices, send out beeps. Trailing 
automobiles becomes very easy, since the trailer can stay 
out of sight and rely on the beeping device to lead him. 
Most beepers are placed on the underside of cars, attached 
by either metal straps or strong magnets. The trailing car 
has a built-in receiver and is able to gauge the direction 
in which the subject car is going, the speed at which it is 
traveling, and the distance between the subject car and the 
trailer. The major difference in all these devices is the dis- 
tance they cover. A medium-priced unit ($150) can usu- 
ally transmit detectable beeps up to three or four miles. 
Continental Telephone (New York) puts out two models, 
both selling for $375. One is installed under the dashboard 
and transmits through the radio antenna, whereas the 
other one contains its own power source and is equipped 
with a powerful magnet so that it can quickly be attached 
to any part of the underneath of an auto. There are less 
expensive beepers from Fudalla & Associates (tail-A-beep 
for $75) and Miles Wireless Intercom, Ltd. (Car-Beeper 
for $150). 
These beeper devices do have disadvantages, in that, 
however well they are hidden, a small wire must be left 
exposed to act as an antenna, unless you are able to use 
an already existing radio antenna. Also the time needed 
to install one of these devices is great and offers a real 
hazard. The best way to get one of these installed is to p* 
off a garage mechanic. 
Voice-activated tape recorders 
The most popular method of electronic espionage is tele- 
phone wiretapping. In the past this had some overwhelm- 
ing disadvantages, which the voice-activated tape recorder 
has done away with. Any method of surveillance involves 
a great amount of wasted time. For several hours of con- 
tinual listening, one may receive two or three minutes of 
useful conversation. In the past, this type of constant sur- 
veillance required that a man sit for hours on end, with 
headphones and a tape recorder, starting and stopping the 
machine. Now, this is no longer necessary, as “Vox” (the 
nickname of the fully automatic voice-activated tape re- 
corder) will upon hearing a voice turn itself on, and at 
the termination of the conversation turn itself off. There 
are a few voice-activated machines on the market today. 
Probably the best of all is the Kinematrix’s Voice-Matic, 
which incorporates an auto-timing device that allows the 
machine to distinguish between real silence and iqomen- 
tary lapses in conversation. This Voice-Matic sells for 
about S35 and should be obtainable through most of the 
mail order electronic supply companies listed in the back 
of this chapter. 
To bring almost any bugging or listening device to life, 
the eavesdropper must employ the use of an AM or FM 
band receiver. This is nothing more than a normal radio 
tuned to one particular band. It is impossible for me to list 
here all the different types of receivers, as none of them is 
manufactured with the art of bugging in mind. Choose the 
ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE, AND SURVEILLANCE / 69 
type of device that best suits the individual needs of the 
type of surveillance work you will be involved with. 
After purchasing the type of unit that best meets your 
requirements, keeping in mind versatility, portability, and 
durability, take the receiver to a local radio or TV repair 
shop, and have them retune it for you. By retuning it, you 
will have less of a problem with other, more powerful, 
transmitters interfering with your desired frequency. Prices 
vary greatly — anywhere from about $40 for a do-it-your- 
self kit, to $300 for a pretty sophisticated receiver. It is 
not necessary to purchase the transmitter and the receiver 
at the same time, or even at the same outlet. In fact, I 
would recommend that it be done separately, as many gov- 
ernmental agencies are extremely interested in persons 
purchasing this type of equipment. One doesn’t have to be 
paranoid, just very careful, and employ common sense in 
whatever operation is being performed. 
Electronic bug detection 
Electronic bug detection will probably be the most dif- 
ficult aspect of this entire field, as you will be working on 
your own, without the aid of much useful information that 
can be gathered from the telephone company or other 
agencies. (Most telephone bugs, except the most sophisti- 
cated ones, can be detected by an overload on the phone 
line itself.) A good tool for bugging detection is a normal 
AM-FM radio receiver, portable, with a telescopic anten- 
na. For application, extend the antenna in the room sus- 
pected of being bugged, and tune the receiver carefully 
from the bottom to the top, covering all the FM frequen- 
cies, at the same time talking to yourself continually. At 
one point, if a bug is present, you will be able to hear your 
voice through the receiver, although the voice may be 
indistinguishable, because of top-volume feedback. This 
feedback will always be a deafening continuous howl, 
scream, or high-pitched whistle. To learn the exact location 
of the bug, cut the volume of the receiver, and slowly move 
around the room. The feedback will increase in volume as 
you get closer to the bug. When a bug is discovered, there 
is a moment of confusion and fear in regard to its elimin- 
ation. In one sense, destroying a bug is an admission of 
guilt, and can do nothing more than provoke the enemy 
to rebug in a more sophisticated manner. For that reason 
I would hesitate to remove a bug. Instead I would attempt 
to use it against the bugger himself, by feeding him false 
and misleading information. 
In some cases, the bugger may have taken precautions 
against this type of detection and, by readjustment of his 
oscillating capacitor, he may be transmitting on a range 
below the sensitivity of your radio. In this case, employ 
your television set in the same manner as you did with 
your radio, using the ultrahigh frequency knob. As you 
move across the range of frequencies, keep your eyes on 
the picture, until you have found a pattern of dark wavy 
lines that move in relation to your own voice, coupled with 
top-volume feedback. The actual location of the bug is a 
little more difficult, unless your TV set is battery operated, 
but by use of several extension cords and slow movement 
this can be accomplished. 
This feedback technique can also be used when the bug- 
ging involves CB (citizen band) walkie-talkie. One of the 
simplest methods of bugging is to tape down the trans- 
mitter button on a cheap walkie-talkie, and plant it where 
the conversation is to be held. The process of detection is 
exactly the same as above, except that, instead of using a 
radio or TV set, one uses a tunable citizen band receiver to 
check for feedback. 
Although the previous “feedback technique” can be ef- 
fective, it is time-consuming and not 100 percent efficient. 
For these reasons, electronic experts have invented and 
marketed a small meter, which detects transmitters. The in- 
teresting problem that these experts had to overcome was, 
with all the high-powered radio and TV stations transmit- 
ting, how would it be possible for an individual to detect 
a low-powered transmitter, such as a microphone? This 
was overcome by simply reversing the gauge. In other 
words, when the meter was “wide open,” no signal was 
present. However, the closer the meter is taken to the 
transmitting device, the less of a reading the meter regis- 
ters. These field-strength meters are available from most 
large electronic companies and range in price from about 
$10 to $200, depending on quality and strength. 
A device similar to the “strength meter,” which a Texas 
company has marketed, utilizes a small bulb, which blinks 
only in the presence of a bug. The true value of this device 
is that it is capable of separating normal radio waves 
(which do not affect it) from the dangerous radio signals 
emitted from a bug. It is available from Dee Company, 
Houston, Texas, for about $200. 
If you’re not electronically minded, or just not equip- 
ped to find the tap on your phone. Continental Telephone 
has a device that allows you, through the use of its meter. 
70 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
to determine if the wire is tapped, and, if so, where it is 
located. Unfortunately this device (called “the Private 
Sentry”) costs $250. 
Electronic jamming 
Most of the devices written about so far in this chapter 
are legal, with regulations placed on their application, but 
the very possession of certain jamming devices is illegal. 
These jamming devices basically destroy the effectiveness 
of a bug rather than locate it. The reason the Federal Com- 
munications Commission has put strict regulations on these 
is the effect they have on other means of communications, 
such as completely destroying AM radio reception, render- 
ing TV sets useless, making communications on police 
band radios impossible, and even to some degree interfer- 
ing with aircraft communications. To be truly effective as 
anti-bugging devices they must cover the whole spectrum of 
radio frequencies, which in turn will cause interference to 
other outside receivers and transmitters. For this reason 
control is of the essence. When determining what exactly 
you wish to jam, you must also determine the frequency to 
be used, so as not to interfere with other signals. If you de- 
cide to use a jamming device for an illegal purpose, you 
must at all costs maintain mobility. (Jamming from the 
back of a moving truck has been proven effective.) Mobil- 
ity is necessary, because the FCC also employs detecting 
and locating devices for use against underground radio 
stations and unregulated jamming devices. 
There are basically two types of jamming devices, the 
first of which is not manufactured commercially and would 
have to be built by the individual. This type is called 
“spark-gap device,” and is more powerful than the other, 
covering a much greater distance. The second type is refer- 
red to as “the white noise device,” and is manufactured by 
Continental Telephone, Dectron Industries, Inc., and 
Telsec, with a price range from about $150 to $350, de- 
pending on strength. 
Electronic scramblers 
Electronic scramblers are devices that simply act as anti- 
bug mechanisms by transforming normal speech patterns 
into unintelligible sounds. The most primitive method, 
outdated today, is recording a message on a tape recorder, 
and then transmitting it, either by playing it backward or 
at a different speed. Although this method may momentar- 
ily frustrate the bugger, if he has half a brain, it won’t take 
him long to decode your message. The basic principle of 
scramblers, or any coding device, is to render the message 
useless to anyone except the desired recipient in control of 
the decoding device. 
There are several types of electronic scramblers, all ef- 
fective but all sharing the same disadvantage — price. The 
most inexpensive one I found in any catalogue ran about 
$500, but then anyone with a slight knowledge of burglary 
will not be put off by this obstacle. This most popular type 
is manufactured by Dectron, and is used as an extension 
to the telephone. The speech is garbled before it enters 
the mouthpiece of the phone, and decoded after it has left 
the receiver. A pair of these run just over $500, but the 
real disadvantage to these devices is that the individual 
code your devices are working with is retained in a vault by 
the company, so that anyone with access to that vault can 
break down your security. 
The second device used for scrambling is manufactured 
by an English company, and it works on the principle of 
inverting the normal speech patterns. In other words, it 
makes low notes high, and high notes low. This offers the 
individual a little bit more security, as each person’s speech 
frequency is as different as his fingerprints. Their major 
disadvantage is price. It sells for between $1,000 and 
$1,500. 
The third type of scrambler is used only for radio trans- 
mission. This device can also be purchased through Dec- 
tron, for about the same price as mentioned before. The 
radio scrambler works on basically the same principle as 
all other scrambling devices, in that it inverts or disorders 
the frequency and pitch of the speech pattern while it is 
being transmitted, and then reverses the garble to render 
it understandable to the receiver. 
Mail order and retail electronics outlets 
I have listed below some of the major electronic mail 
order and retail outlets. Many companies that sell this type 
of equipment do so only to police officers, and require the 
purchaser to prove his relationship with some law enforce- 
ment agency. For that reason they have not been included. 
The companies listed are all involved in the manufacturing 
and/or sale of eavesdropping and surveillance equipment.

The Federal Communications Commission and the 
Supreme Court have been uptight about wiretapping and 
eavesdropping for some time. They have both passed laws 
and made regulations concerning electronic surveillance. 
For these reasons, I would emphasize the utmost care and 
knowledge in the application of these devices. What is in- 
teresting is the actual wording of the law, where any inter- 
state wiretap (interstate does not mean interstate, it applies 
to all tapping through some strange logic) except in a 
matter of security is against the FCC’s regulations and is 
punishable by a fine of no more than $10,000 or five years 
in jail. The neat little exception made for security gives all 
of the government agencies, particularly the FBI and CIA, 
and all local police departments, free license to practice all 
and any forms of surveillance without any restrictions. Al- 
though certain cases have been dismissed in court cases 
because of “tainted” methods of collecting evidence, in 
reality if the government feels an individual is a security 
risk (for any reason) it can produce tapes in court that 
have been gathered by wiretapping, supposedly not as evi- 
dence, but the defendant goes to jail anyway. 
America, at this point, is operating on a life-size Mon- 
opoly Board. Everyone who isn’t in jail or going directly to 
jail is buying and selling thousands of pieces of paper, with 
absolute seriousness of purpose, unable to realize that 
there will be only one winner, and when he gets out of jail, 
he’s going to kick all their asses. 
Broadcasting free radio 
In any underground, throughout history, a prime con- 
cern has been communications or propaganda. Propa- 
ganda, as a word, has ugly connotations, but in reality it 
means nothing more than the distribution of information. 
This country has begun to develop an underground net- 
work of communications, in the many small newspapers 
which have cropped up all over the country. Although 
there is a spark, there is also a monstrous lack of commun- 
ications, once you get outside any of the large metropolitan 
areas. In preparation for writing this book, I had to do a 
great deal of reference work. In this reading I encompassed 
almost all extremities of the political spectrum, from far 
left to far right. These extremities are so alike, and could 
be so powerful if they ever got over their preconceived im- 
pressions of each other and started to communicate. This 
is the reason I feel the underground has to take propaganda 
one step further, from the printed page, to the radio broad- 
cast. 
The radio is a factor of extraordinary importance. At 
moments when war fever is more or less palpitating in 
every one region or a country, the inspiring, burning 
word increases this fever and communicates it to every 
one of the future combatants. It explains, teaches, fires, 
and fixes the future positions of both friends and ene- 
mies. However, the radio should be ruled by the funda- 
mental principle of popular propaganda, which is truth; 
it is preferable to tell the truth, small in its dimensions, 
than a large lie artfully embellished. 
Che Guevara, Guerrilla Warfare 
Kwame Nkrumah, in his Handbook of Revolutionary 
Warfare, also stresses the use of radio propaganda. He 
breaks it down into two basic forms: The first and most im- 
portant is the same as Che was writing about in the above 
72 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
quotation, this being to communicate truth to people of the 
country about the struggle. Nkrumah takes this idea one 
step further, and says that really to communicate the 
underground must speak on many different levels, and this 
is a key point. How can an anarchist who has a right-wing 
background understand or relate to a left-wing anarchist, 
who uses Marxist terminology? This forces the under- 
ground to communicate with many different frames of 
reference. This hasn’t happened in this country: Everyone 
from far left to the far right is hung up with dogmatic 
ideals, overused terminology, and is absolutely blind to 
practicality. 
Nkrumah’s second concept of propaganda is for the pur- 
pose of subverting the enemy. 
An indispensable preliminary to battle is to attack the 
mind of the enemy, to undermine the will to fight so that 
the result of the battle is decided before the fighting be- 
gins. The revolutionary army attacks an irresolute and 
demoralized army. 
— Nkrumah, Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare 
This use of propaganda to discourage the enemy has also 
a great place in the struggle that is going on in this country 
today. It has been used to a small degree, with fantastic 
success, around military bases. There was a regiment of the 
National Guard that refused to go to Chicago during the 
National Democratic Convention. Underground news- 
papers and handbills have encouraged G.I.s to dissent 
and desert, and have shown them that it is possible. The 
effectiveness demonstrated by this demoralizing form of 
propaganda depicts nothing more than the real turmoil that 
exists. The successful effect of this communication has re- 
sulted from one aspect of its nature — that being its pas- 
sionate regard for truth. 
Printing a revolutionary newspaper is a great deal easier 
than forming an underground radio station. Although the 
government has strict restrictions on printed material, it 
is nothing like the regulations it places on radio and tele- 
vision broadcasting. The FCC runs the radio networks with 
an iron hand, with the ever present threat of revoking a 
license. For this reason, any radio station which is striving 
to be absolutely free must make the ultimate break with 
the FCC. This can be accomplished in two ways. The first 
and most dangerous, but at the same time the most effec- 
tive, is by using high power equipment, jamming out other 
stations, from a mobile base of operations. The FCC has 
incredibly sophisticated equipment, and can locate any 
pirate radio station in a matter of minutes. For this reason, 
mobility is essential. Transmitting from the back of a dis- 
guised truck has been used successfully, although the 
movement of the truck while broadcasting must be con- 
stant, never repeating the same pattern, but at the same 
time keeping within the broadcast power area. This means 
of transmission is especially effective at gatherings, such as 
demonstrations and riots, to keep people informed as to 
the movement of the enemy. The best method of obtaining 
equipment is building your own, as to buy a large trans- 
mitter requires the individual to be licensed. Not only that, 
it’s expensive. You can build your own from plans and 
equipment purchased through mail order, from most of the 
companies listed earlier in this chapter. 
The second method for getting around the strict FCC 
regulations is legal. Under the FCC’s low-power-transmis- 
sion regulations, one can legally broadcast below 100 milo- 
watts at any empty space on the AM or FM dial, without 
registering or being licensed. The disadvantages are ob- 
vious: One can only broadcast up to one mile. Even within 
that mile, interference from the high-powered commercial 
stations is present. And if enough people get into this form 
of broadcasting the FCC is going to make some sort of reg- 
ulation against it. This method is not just theoretical, it 
has been implemented on the Lower East Side, by John 
Giomo and his Guerrilla Radio. He broadcast from the top 
of St. Mark’s-in-the-Bowerie’s bell tower at 1400 on the 
AM dial, and claims he did everything the FCC said he 
couldn’t. I am sorry to say I did not hear the broadcast, 
as I was out of the one-mile area at the time. 
Telephone and communications sabotage 
Telephone sabotage can be applied on many levels. First 
I will explain what 1 am not going to write about. I feel 
there is no need for me to explain how to make free phone 
calls by telling the operator that you dialed the wrong 
number, just as 1 am not going to get into explaining how 
to use a number 14 washer with Scotch tape in a pay 
phone, or cheating on credit card calls, or spitting on a pen- 
ny. These are all explained in Fuck the System, a pamphlet 
on living freely in New York City. The interest I have in 
telephone sabotage is purely communicational and com- 
mercial. 
Commercial in the sense, that over the past few years 
my absolute hatred of vending machines and pay phones 
ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE, AND SURVEILLANCE / 73 
has led me to break into almost every kind I could find. 
Parking meters are the easiest by far: All you need is a 
hammer and chisel or a large monkey wrench. Soda 
machines are almost as easy, but real delight comes from 
ripping a Kotex machine off the wall of a women’s rest 
room, or sticking a small explosive charge in the coin slot 
of a pay toilet. I have never been able to break into a pay 
telephone — smash them, yes, put them out of order, but 
never able to open them up and remove the coins. This is 
for several reasons: One is the time element, as most public 
phones are easily seen, and the other is that all public 
phones are installed with amazing locks, which have com- 
pletely baffled me. 
To get back to the purpose-of this section, I must em- 
phasize the importance of breaking down the enemy’s com- 
munications. This in turn results in^ confusion and chaos. 
Imagine, for a moment, a squad car without a means of 
communicating with its precinct, or an enemy aircraft with 
its radio jammed. This act of breaking down the enemy’s 
lines of communications is not an end in itself, rather it is 
a tactic — a small, but extremely important, part of a total 
operation. 
When considering communications, it is best to start 
from a primitive base and work up to more sophisticated 
tactics. The first and simplest method for rendering a tele- 
phone inoperative is only temporary. It entails calling the 
phone company and asking that a certain number be discon- 
nected. This will work for individuals, but not for agencies 
or law enforcement organizations. An important factor in 
any form of telephone sabotage is the time aspect of veri- 
fication — in other words, the amount of time it takes the 
phone company to trace a call. The phone company can 
tell right away if you are calling from a pay phone, so this 
should be avoided. Call from a private phone which you 
cannot be connected with, and limit your conversation to 
under ninety seconds. Important: Most law enforcement 
organizations, companies, corporations, and businesses 
have more than one phone line, and in most cases one or 
more will be' unlisted. 
A common misconception is that a person can render a 
phone useless by dialing a number and, before the party 
answers, leave the phone off the hook. This is not true, and 
doesn’t work. Even if the caller doesn’t hang up his phone, 
the receiver can get a dial tone by hanging up himself and 
holding the hook down for a little over thirty seconds. Al- 
though this method does not work in the city (I know be- 
cause I have experimented with it), I have heard reports 
that it has been used in rural areas with varying degrees of 
success. I would suggest trying it out with a friend, to see if 
it is effective in your area. 
The other truly effective method is the most dangerous. 
It entails the actual cutting of phone wires. This is much 
easier in a rural area where the phone lines are above the 
ground, and there are not so many of them. It should be 
noted that complete telephone communication with a small 
town or village can be broken in less than ten minutes. 
Probably the most important thing here is having a com- 
plete understanding of what you are doing, and using the 
correct tools. Phone lines do carry electrical charges and, 
without complete knowledge of what you are doing and 
without the correct tools, it would be very easy to electro- 
cute yourself. In rural areas, the basic tools should be: 
rubber-soled shoes (sneakers); pliers with rubber grips; 
large heavy-duty wire or tin cutters, also with rubber grips; 
a pair of surgical rubber gloves; a small flashlight (operate 
at night) ; and a body strap to allow you free movement of 
your hands once at the top of the pole. Important, before 
attempting any telephone wire cutting, get hold of a copy 
of the telephone repairman’s manual, and read it. 
This same operation can be performed in urban areas, 
although the process is much more involved. In most urban 
areas the phone lines run beneath the street level, and they 
are usually incorporated into tunnels dug, for the sewers. At 
this point it may seem simple but, in addition to the phone 
lines in the sewers, there are also all the high-voltage elec- 
tric lines. If you cut into one of these, I don’t care how well 
insulated you are, you’ll fry. An urban saboteur should 
either be in possession of a detailed map of the phone 
lines, available at any municipal library, or carry a small 
electric line locator, so that he can find the right line to 
cut. The urban guerrilla, on this sort of mission, should 
carry all the tools the rural guerrilla would have, except he 
should exchange the body strap for a rubber-insulated hack 
saw, also add a crowbar. The hack saw is for the metal 
encasement that surrounds all phone and electric wires in 
the sewers. Access to the sewers is pretty easy, as most 
manholes will take you into an amazing complex of all dif- 
ferent-sized tunnels, where you can get thoroughly lost, 
unless you have had the foresight to study a map of the 
sewers, also available from any municipal library. Know 
exacdy where you are going, know all the obstacles that 
you may come in contact with, and have several routes of 
74 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
escape planned, in case of an emergency. Needless to say, 
if you decide to go into the sewers, dress accordingly. It’s 
cold, damp, infested with rodents, and dark, and many 
tunnels are partially full of water. 
A word of caution about using explosives to sever phone 
lines: In the sewers, don’t. In Paris in 1945, the French 
resistance decided that to aid the oncoming Allied troops, 
they would cut all lines of communication from the Nazi 
Headquarters and Berlin. This proved unsuccessful, for 
many reasons, but the important fact was that they did at- 
tempt to use explosives in the sewer system. A small charge 
was placed right on the phone lines, and detonated from a 
good distance away. The phone line was cut but, unknown 
to the resistance, so was a gas main, right next to lines. The 
result: phone lines cut, a large number of civilians dead, 
and a block and a half completely leveled. Not only was 
the area totally destroyed, it was flooded by the bursting of 
water mains which also shared the sewers with the phone 
wires. 
One can use small explosive charges in rural areas, as 
the lines are above the ground. 
I despise you. 
I despise your order, your false-propped authority. 
Hang me for it ! ! ! 
— Louis Lingg, 1898 
Other forms of sabotage 
A great deal of sabotage employs the use of explosive 
charges, but these methods will be discussed in a later 
chapter; here I will attempt to discuss nonexplosive sabo- 
tage operations. Sabotage plays a very important role in 
any form of warfare, especially in the guerrilla struggle. 
The urban areas are extremely conducive to the type of 
sabotage I will be dealing with in this section, as the dis- 
tances are short between targets, and it is easier to create 
chaos and havoc when dealing with large numbers of peo- 
ple, in a relatively small area. This havoc and chaos that 
I have been talking about needs a definition, since I am 
using the terms in a different context than what they mean 
traditionally. Havoc and chaos are and should be the small- 
est part of the revolution. They take the smallest amount of 
time, and the maximum amount of planning. This time will 
be governed by a mob, driven not by fear, but by anger, 
and the passionate belief that they do what they do because 
they are the people, and more importantly they believe they 
have impunity. I do not speak of the tactics of nihilism, 
breaking windows and setting garbage cans on fire, for 
they accomplish nothing. 
A few of the more active indiyiduals in New York City 
placed a strong form of epoxy glue in all the keyholes of 
the stock market, on Wall Street. When this substance 
dried, it hardened into a material as tough as steel. The 
Stock Exchange opened three hours late, after locksmiths 
had been called in to remove the useless mechanisms. 
Epoxy glue is fantastic, and its uses are unlimited. 
Since machines run the society we live in, it’s only fair 
that an equal degree of destructive creativity be leveled 
against them. Computers, because of their very nature, are 
extremely easy to render inoperative. When paying bills by 
computer, always remember that you have the ultimate 
advantage of an open mind, and the ability to rationalize, 
whereas the machine is programmed to do one thing. A 
good method of sabotage is simply to punch a few extra 
holes in the IBM card. Most of the time the card will be 
rejected, and it will cost the company a few dollars to 
rectify the mistake. I have heard of people who have 
performed this operation, and have been issued several 
hundred dollars’ worth of credit. This can be performed 
with impunity. 
When I was working for a large New York corporation. 
I had to deal with a bank, every day. ''I realized, after a 
period of time, that the people who were working at the 
bank had lost their identities, and were nothing more than 
machines themselves. Well, this sort of psychological sur- 
realistic science fiction really got me interested. I viewed 
myself as a saver of identities, as the Messiah of the Spirit 
of Individualism. I was brought to earth quickly. These 
people didn’t want to be saved. I was going to turn them 
all on to acid, but then I decided that a better tactic would 
be to screw up the object of their emulation, the computer. 
On my daily deposit I placed a large quantity of Scotch 
tape. This resulted in the deposit slips, themselves, getting 
stuck in the bowels of the computer. It took the bank 
three or four hours to take the machine apart, and unjam 
the mechanism. In unjamming the machine they somehow 
altered the program, and it didn’t work right for weeks. I 
never had the guts to return to the bank, but I hope the 
clerks lost their reverence for the divine, infallible machine. 
Another form of sabotage is shoplifting. There is a big 
ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE, AND SURVEILLANCE / 75 
difference between a common thief and a revolutionary: 
The revolutionary will steal from large corporations, and 
the common thief will steal from anyone. If you can ever 
get over the Protestant ethic, you will be able to see what 
I mean. Every revolutionary has his own method of steal- 
ing, and there are too many for me to get into, but I will 
try to state some basic common-sense tactics. 
1. Operate in pairs with one person holding the employee’s 
attention, the other stealing him blind. 
2. As a revolutionary, your job is to rally popular support, 
not to alienate people. For this reason, do not steal from 
small stores. 
3. Get into and out of the store as fast as possible. Do not 
spend a long time trying to hide the merchandise, or 
making sure no one’s looking at you. 
4. If you are caught, play along. In other words, be hum- 
ble, and pretend to be nervous. Always apologize profuse- 
ly, and even cry if you can. The chances are good the 
store won’t have you arrested. 
5. If you are caught and let go with a warning, never 
return to the same store. 
6. Usually large department stores do not arrest shoplifters 
the first time, unless they are violent, or the merchandise 
is over a certain dollar value. Be careful all the same. 
7. Circular mirrors are very popular with large stores, 
where blind corners are present. These can effectively be 
used against the employees by simply reversing their pur- 
pose. Watch out for two-way mirrors. 
8. If you’re going to get into shoplifting in a big way, check 
out all its aspects. A large store located near a big subway 
stop, (Times Square, Grand Central, or Penn Station) of- 
fers a great means of escape, especially in the rush hour, if 
a chase develops. 
9. Never carry identification with you. Work out a system 
with a friend (see the last chapter) whereby he will be able 
to verify your false name and address. 
10. Needless to say, never carry dope, weapons, or any- 
thing else illegal with you. 
11. If caught for shoplifting or robbery never admit to 
being part of the movement. It will get you more time in 
jail. 
Another extremely easy method of sabotage can be em- 
ployed against motor vehicles. Law enforcement cars, 
jeeps, weapons carriers, all the way up to tanks, can be 
rendered useless by several simple operations. The first of 
these is the simplest, but it is only temporary. It entails 
removing an important part of the vehicle’s mechanism, 
such as the distributor cap or battery. There is no doubt 
that this will work, and can be accomplished in a matter 
of seconds, but the vehicle can also be repaired in a matter 
of seconds, if the parts are available. 
The second method, which is equally effective, and by 
no means temporary, can also be performed in a matter of 
seconds. It is accomplished by pouring several pounds of 
either sand or sugar into the vehicle’s gas tank. This re- 
sults in these foreign particles jamming and virtually de- 
stroying the motor. The sugar will crystallize in the fuel 
line and carburetor and effectively block the operation of 
the engine. The sand, on the other hand, will rip the inside 
of the engine to shreds. Both of these ingredients will stop 
the operation of a vehicle permanently, as repair would re- 
quire a complete overhaul of the engine, which is usually 
impossible in combat situations. 
The third method is total destruction of the vehicle, by 
burning or exploding. An important thing to keep in mind, 
before destroying anything, is the use it might have to the 
movement. To burn a car, just siphon some of the gasoline 
out of its tank, by means of a section of hollow tube, and 
pour it over the car. If the car is locked, smash the win- 
dows and soak the inside with gas also, then ignite. 
A very important thing to remember in any form of 
subversive activity is to allow an escape route. Things are 
bound to go wrong, I don’t care how many precautions a 
person takes there will be something he hasn’t thought of. 
Cars are an excellent method of escape. Of course it helps 
a great deal when stealing a car, if the person has left his 
keys in the ignition, but, if not, there are other ways. Any 
auto repair manual can tell you how to jump the ignition, 
or “hot wire” a car. Volkswagens are extremely easy. An- 
other trick which can be used with old Chevrolets (before 
1964) is to catch a car with the ignition switch on “off.” 
The keys can be extracted from the ignition of an old 
Chevie without locking it. The car’s engine will be off, but 
it can be started by simply turning the receptacle for the 
key, and stepping on the gas pedal. I drove a car from 
New York to Florida without a key. 
The car may be started without a key when it is left in any 
of the positions (2, 3, 4). 
There are a few basic rules for sabotage and guerrilla 
activity in general’. 
1. Make sure the operation will be effective. Never waste 
time with either a violent or nonviolent operation which 
is ineffective. 
2. Hit the enemy where they least expect it, and where it 
will hurt them the most. 
3. Most sabotage should be carried out at night. 
4. Timing must be perfect, as the longer the operation takes 
the greater the chances are of something going wrong. 
5. Work only with people you trust. Many spies and in- 
formers will suggest plans that could only get you busted. 
Work in small groups, or cells, consisting of no more than 
four people, 
6. All operations should be simple and fast, and several 
means of escape should be planned. 
7. All weapons should be concealed, all explosives should 
be treated with the respect they deserve. (Check the chap- 
ter on explosives for correct handling.) 
8. All groups must have a leader. He should be picked for 
his leadership qualities. He will make all major decisions. 
9. The need for secrecy is obvious. Security and secrecy 
must be maintained without reservation. 
10. Any member who breaks the code of the group must be 
executed, in full view of the other members. 
The time has passed for demonstrators and pseudo- 
revolutionaries and students to occupy the political scene. 
The time is here for a mass uprising, incorporating all these 
elements, armed with single-minded deadly intolerance. 
There is no justice in bureaucracy for the individual, for 
bureaucracy caters only to itself. The writers, artists, and 
poets of the revolution will have a job that has never before 
in history been so great, for they must create a value 
structure for the New World, for The New American. 1 
stated in the introduction that this would not be in a con- 
temporaiy sense a political book, and I feel that it is not. 
inasmuch as I have tried to avoid using the dogma that is 
so prevalent now. It seems acceptable today to scream for 
revolution, without any concept of what will follow it, This 
is just what the forces at large want, for who will follow i 
man who doesn’t know where he’s going? 
To be successful, man must change himself, the individ- 
ual must have a revolution within himself, for then and 
only then will he be able to change the world. There is no 
room for narrow-mindedness in the coming insurrection 
Each man must break, with passionate understanding, the 
chains which chain him to himself. For if one man dies in 
indifference, the entire revolution dies with him. One can- 
not practice the same bureaucracy one is fighting against; 
the revolution is secondary, the system is secondary, pol- 
itics is secondary, to the individual. 
Effective sabotage, like the practical joke, must employ 
a grain of truth in a solution of deadly irony. This means 
that sabotage serves two basic purposes; first of all to 
weaken the enemy, and second of all to build the morale of 
the liberation army. Although revolution and sabotage are 
deadly serious, one should always retain his sense of humor 
and apply it if possible to the operations used. An example, 
which can be employed today with the draft system, is to 
use the weaknesses of the bureaucracy against itself. 
When a young man is forced to go down to his local 
board and register for the draft, he is required to give only 
a small amount of information. To use this fact effectively 
against the Selective Service System, a large group of young 
men must go to a local board and register twice or three 
times under false names, in addition to their real registra- 
tion. This will cause the bureaucracy of the Selective Serv- 
ice System to go berserk. They’re already so uptight about 
people attempting to avoid the draft that they would really 
flip out if all of a sudden their records showed that sev- 
eral hundreds or thousands of people just didn’t show up. 
and couldn't be traced. It would never enter their heads to 
think it might have been a put-on. An interesting theatrical 
twist to this same idea is to have everyone do his false 
registrations on the same day, so that many, many pre-in- 
duction physicals are due on the same day. Thus the full 
impact of the missing persons will hit the induction center 
at one time.

THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK / 
77 
78 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
As I have stressed before, men, not weapons or equip- 
ment, make up a revolution. A revolution is made up of 
ideas that cannot be implemented without struggle. But 
struggle is no goal unto itself, nihilism is a childish answer 
to adult problems. When thinking about weapons, one 
must bear several things in mind: the availability of these 
weapons and ammunition, the effectiveness of the weapons, 
and the portability of the weapons. When struggling with 
an enemy that is more powerful than the guerrilla army, an 
excellent tactic is using the enemy’s weapons, since there is 
a virtually unlimited supply of parts and ammunition. All 
weapons that are not stolen from the enemy should be paid 
for in full, as a revolutionary’s purpose is to rally popular 
support, rather than alienate the people he is supposedly 
fighting for. 
By weapons, I do not mean to say just firearms. In this 
chapter I will try to cover most of the weapons a revolu- 
tionary or guerrilla would need. These needs will differ 
somewhat from rural and urban locations. I will attempt to 
cover not only the weapons that are available to the indi- 
vidual, but also weapons employed by the army and the 
police force. This will be for two purposes: first to acquaint 
the freedom fighter with what he will be up against, and 
secondly to inform him on the use of these weapons once 
captured. 
This chapter could be quite large. For that reason, I 
have broken it down into several basic sections, with demo- 
litions following in the next chapter. The first section will 
cover hand-to-hand combat, one’s natural weapons, and a 
few hand weapons — both police and civilian. These de- 
vices will encompass equipment available from suppliers, 
equipment that can be stolen, and equipment that can be 
made at home. The next section will cover lethal weapons 
(handguns, rifles, shotguns, and larger machine guns). 
The last section will discuss the use of chemical agents 
and gas, both defensively and offensively. An important 
factor to bear in mind at this point in the revolution is the 
legality of these weapons. Most of the weapons that are 
described in the following chapter are illegal and posses- 
sion, whether concealed or not, can lead to long jail terms. 
For that reason I strongly re-emphasize security, secrecy, 
and the fact that the application of these weapons must be 
careful, deliberate, and extremely well planned. 
I have no patience with individuals who claim that 
everything will be beautiful if guns and other weapons are 
outlawed. These people do not have the foresight to rea- 
lize that, if weapons are made illegal, they will only be 
possessed by enemies of the people (i.e., the army, the 
police, outlaws, and madmen). I feel very strongly that 
every person should be armed and that he or she should 
be prepared for the worst. There is no justice left in the 
system. The only real justice is that which' the individual 
creates for himself, and the individual is helpless without a 
gun. This may sound like the dogma expounded by rad- 
ical right-wing groups, like the Minute Men. It is. 
Unity is the only way in which the people of this countr\ 
can overthrow the fascists, communists, capitalists, and all 
the other assholes who claim running a representative gov- 
ernment is so difficult. The emphasis has been taken from 
the Bill of Rights and placed on the type of interpretation of 
the Constitution that best suits the people in power. 
Natural weapons 
A chapter on weapons should begin with the basics — 
those being the primitive, but effective, maneuvers of the 
body, for the purpose of killing a man. I will not try to 
get into judo, karate, or any other form of sporting combat, 
for that would take a book in itself. What 1 will try to do 
with this section is describe the basic methods of killing 
another man with one’s own hands. If this turns your 
stomach, just remember that your enemy does know what 
he’s doing, and, if you don’t, he then has the obvious ad- 
vantage. Two good reference works on this subject are 
The Special Forces Combatant Manual and The Marine 
Corps Field Manual on Physical Security. This training is 
of great use to any person interested in revolution in a 
serious sense. It will build confidence in the individual and 
take away false security and reliance on a firearm. It is 
also useful for night patrols, and for sabotage missions 
where silence is of the essence. There are five basic funda- 
mentals of hand-to-hand combat: 
1. Make full use of any and all available weapons. 
2. Attack aggressively, if possible by surprise, using max- 
imum strength against your enemy’s weakest point. 
3. Maintain your balance at all times and destroy your 
enemy’s. 
4. Maneuver your enemy in such a way as to use his 
momentum to his disadvantage. 
5. Learn each phase of the training before trying to attain 
speed. Precision is, at the beginning, more important. 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS 
79 
Hand-to-hand combat 
When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, your life is al- 
ways at stake, and you should recognize that fact. Using 
any available weapon is just common sense. Throwing sand 
in the enemy’s eyes can result in temporary blindness and 
confusion; this should be taken advantage of immediately. 
There is only one purpose in hand-to-hand combat, and 
that is to kill. Never face an enemy with the idea of knock- 
ing him out. The chances are extremely good that he will 
kill you. 
When a weapon is not available, one must resort to the 
full use of his natural weapons. The natural weapons are: 
the knife edge of your hands, fingers folded at the second 
joint or knuckle; the protruding knuckle of your second 
finger; the heel of your hand; the little finger edge of your 
hand; your boot; elbow; knees; and teeth. 
Attacking is a primary factor. A fight was never won by 
defensive action, and this is not a high school brawl, this 
is a matter of life and death. Attack with all your strength. 
At any point or in any situation some vulnerable point on 
your enemy’s body will be open for attack. Do so scream- 
ing, as a scream has two purposes: first, to frighten and 
confuse your enemy; second, to allow you to take a 
deep breath, which in turn will put more oxygen in your 
blood stream, and afford you more strength than you would 
normally have. Your balance and the balance of your op- 
ponent are very important factors; since, if you succeed 
in making your enemy lose his balance, the chances are 
nine to one you can kill him in the next move. The best 
overall stance for hand-to-hand combat is where your feet 
are spread about a shoulder’s width apart, with your right 
foot about a foot ahead of the left. Both arms should be 
bent at the elbows parallel to each other, either side of the 
face and throat. Stand on the balls of your feet, and bend 
slightly at the waist, somewhat like a boxer’s crouch. Em- 
ploying a yell or scream, or sudden movement with either 
hand, can throw your enemy off-balance. 
There are many vulnerable points to the body, and the 
next several pages will cover each briefly, with explanations 
of direct attack. 
Eyes: Temporary or permanent blindness can be in- 
duced by several means, first by forming a “V” shape with 
your index and middle fingers and driving them into your 
opponent’s eyes, keeping a stiff wrist and fingers. Done 
with force this can be permanent. The thumb or middle 
knuckle can be used in gouging the eyes. 
Nose: The nose is an extremely vulnerable point of at- 
tack. It can be struck with the knife edge of the hand. 
across the bridge. This will cause breakage, sharp pain, 
temporary blindness, and, if the blow is hard enough, 
-death, as the nose bone with force can be driven up into the 
brain. Another method of attacking the nose is to deliver 
an upward blow with the heel of your hand. This will have 
the same effect as the blow on the bridge. 
Adam’s apple: The Adam’s apple is usually pretty hard 
to get at, because anyone who values his life has learned 
to keep his chin down, but if you find you do have an open- 
ing, strike a hard blow with the knife edge of your hand. 
This can either be a forearm or backarm blow. The 
chances are, if you connect with a hard blow, your enemy 
will die, with a severed windpipe, but if the blow was only 
partially effective you may still find your enemy in severe 
pain or gagging. Another method of attack on a man’s 
Adam’s apple is squeezing it between your forefinger and 
thumb. 
Temple: An enemy can easily be killed by a sharp blow 
to the temple, as there are a large nerve and an artery close 
to the skin. A heavy blow delivered with the knife edge of 
your hand will kill instantly. A moderate blow to the tem- 
ple will cause severe pain and concussion. If you succeed 
in knocking your enemy down, kick him hard in the tem- 
ple, with the toe or heel of your boot. It will insure that he 
will never get up again. 
Nape of the neck: A rabbit punch, or blow delivered 
with the knife edge of the hand to the base of the neck, 
can easily kill a man by breaking his neck, but to be safe it 
is better to use another weapon, such as the butt of a gun, 
or a hammer. If you can knock your opponent to the 
ground, apply a kick to the back of his neck with either 
a knee drop or the heel of your boot. Generally speaking, 
the side or heel of the boot is a better weapon than the toe, 
as it tends to slide off the object it is attacking. 
Upper lip: The point where the nose cartilage joins the 
upper section of the jaw is where a large network of nerves 
is located. This network of nerves is extremely close to the 
skin, and a sharp upward blow, with the knife edge of 
your hand, will cause extreme pain and unconsciousness. 
Ears: Coming up behind the enemy and cupping the 
hands in a clapping motion over the victim’s ears can kill 
him also immediately. The vibrations caused from the clap- 
80 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
ping motion will burst the victim’s eardrums, and cause 
internal bleeding in the brain. 
Chin: Ever since the cowboy movies got a firm hold on 
the American people, every other punch has been directed 
at the chin. The chin isn’t that vulnerable. An effective 
blow can be delivered with the heel of the hand, but stay 
away from swinging with a closed fist. More fingers are 
broken and wrists sprained by people swinging with a 
closed fist. 
Groin: This is the one spot that everyone who has ever 
been in a fight is conscious of, and tries to defend. If it is 
left open, attack viciously with your knee in an upward 
motion. A person can also use his fist or heel, especially 
if he has managed to floor his opponent. 
Solar plexus: The solar plexus is a large network of 
nerves located at the bottom of the rib cage. A blow should 
be struck slightly upward with the protruding knuckle of 
the middle finger. A sharp blow can cause severe pain and 
unconsciousness. 
Spine: The spinal column houses the spinal nerves, and 
a well-directed blow to this region can easily kill or para- 
lyze an enemy. The only really effective means of delivery 
for a blow of this sort is after you succeed in knocking your 
enemy to the ground. The blow can be made by either the 
knee, elbow, heel, or toe. It should be directed about two 
inches above the belt line, as this is where the spine is 
least protected. 
Kidneys: A large nerve that branches off the spinal cord 
comes very close to the skin at the kidneys, and a direct 
blow to the kidneys can cause death. To attack this area, 
you can either use the knife edge of your hand or a fist 
that is folded at the second knuckle. If you have knocked 
your opponent to the ground, a blow may be delivered with 
the toe or heel. 
Collar bone: A sharp blow delivered with either your el- 
bow or the knife edge of your hand can break the collar 
bone and bring an enemy to his knees. 
Floating ribs: The floating ribs are sensitive parts of the 
body and can either be attacked from the front or back. It 
is best to attack and deliver a blow to the enemy’s right 
side, since this is where his liver is located. A stunning 
blow can effectively be delivered by using the knife edge 
of your hand or, if you have managed to down your op- 
ponent, you can kill your enemy with a kick from your 
heel, elbow, knee, or toe. Remember always that you are 
not engaged in a high school brawl, you are fighting for 
your life, and therefore should use full force at all times. 
Stomach: There are many combinations of blows which 
can form a basic attack pattern, but one of the most basic 
is a blow to the stomach. Excepting the solar plexus, the 
stomach is an area which cannot be treated as an end in 
itself, rather as a starting point for a series of blows. The 
best way to strike the stomach and get maximum penetra- 
tion is to go at it with a fist formed by folding the fingers at 
the second knuckle, and striking deeply with a slightly up- 
swing. A blow to the stomach will cause the enemy to bend 
deeply forward. When this occurs, either strike your enemy 
full force with your knee in his face, or employ a well-di- 
rected rabbit punch to the base of his neck. 
Armpit: A large network of nerves is very close to the 
skin in the armpits. The great problem with a direct strike 
to this area is its lack of accessibility. For that reason, it 
is more likely that you would attack this area after you 
have managed to bring your opponent to the ground, and 
are in control of his arm. An attack should be led by a toe 
or heel kick. A sharp blow to this area will cause severe 
pain and temporary partial paralysis. 
Instep: The bones in the instep are very small and weak, 
and can be broken quite easily. A stomp, using the edge of 
your right boot to your enemy’s right instep, is effective 
and at the same time protects your groin area. The instep 
is an area to remember, as it is almost never defended or 
protected, and, if directly attacked, can render an enemy 
immobile and in severe pain. This attack area is also useful 
for breaking an opponent’s grip, especially if he is holding 
you from the back (i.e., a full nelson). 
Knee: Kick your enemy’s kneecap by delivering a blow 
with the edge of your boot (not with the toe, as it is liable 
to slip off, and leave your enemy unharmed). The blow 
should come on an upward swing there to catch the under- 
neath of the kneecap and rip the cartilage and ligaments. 
This will cause severe pain and affect mobility. If you man- 
age to get behind your enemy, a blow to the knee can just 
as easily and effectively be delivered. 
Shoulder: If you manage to get hold of an opponent’s 
arm, it takes very little strength to twist it, thus causing 
dislocation. This operation should be performed quickly. 
It is not the job of a guerrilla fighter to torture his enemy. 
He should dispose of him as fast as possible. The twisting 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS / 81 
action involved in this operation might remind one of a 
half nelson or hammer lock performed quickly with the 
object in mind to create disability rather than pain. The 
type of action can also be performed well if you have 
managed to bring your opponent to the ground. It can be 
followed by a knee drop to the spinal cord, which will re- 
sult in paralysis or death. 
Elbow: The joint in the elbow is one of the weakest 
points in the body, and can be dislocated or broken with a 
relatively forceful blow. Grasp your enemy’s wrist or fore- 
arm and pull it behind him. This will cause his arm to stif- 
fen. As you are doing this, strike a sharp blow with the 
heel of your hand to the backside of his stiffened elbow. 
This will result, depending on the strength of the blow, 
in either dislocation or breakage. 
Wrist: A wristlock is useful for several reasons. Most 
importantly, an enemy can be controlled in this position. A 
wristlock is nothing more than placing both thumbs on the 
back of an opponent’s hand and bending it at a right angle 
to the forearm. This will produce extreme pain and loss of 
balance. 
Fingers: The fingers are an important consideration, be- 
cause more than half the blows your enemy is capable of 
delivering entail the use of the fingers, in one form or an- 
other. The fingers can be broken in several ways. One of 
the most effective is by using the left hand as a lever: Grasp 
the wrist and pry it down, while at the same time bend, 
with the right hand, the middle and index fingers back. This 
will cause breakage. This operation can be used to break 
many grips. 
A word of caution should be noted at this point. These 
operations should be practiced before used. As with al- 
most everything else, just reading about techniques is not 
good enough. One must practice and become skillful, fast, 
and precise. In training yourself, you should never forget 
that only a small amount of pressure is capable of killing 
or maiming an individual. Therefore, take it easy on your 
training partner. 
Application of hand weapons 
If a weapon is available, only a fool will choose to use 
his hands and feet, but what is more important is the appli- 
cation of these weapons. I would rather fight a man with 
a knife, without a knife myself, if the person did not know 
how to use it — meaning that I had two hands free where 
he had the hindrance of a weapon he was not skilled in 
using. When considering a type of makeshift weapon, al- 
ways take into account what it is going to be used for, and 
how well you will be able to use it. 
Hand weapons 
A bayonet hilt, tent peg, or any blunt object can be ex- 
tremely effective in silencing a sentry. A sharp blow with 
any of these objects, directly to the back of the neck, will 
in most cases break the enemy’s neck and kill him instantly. 
A blackjack can easily be made from wet sand and an 
old sock. You fill the sock about a quarter full of sand, 
tying a knot just above the sand. When attacking an 
enemy, you should strike hard at the nape of the neck. This 
will result in the same injuries as described in the above 
paragraph. 
If you have a rifle, but no ammunition, use the gun as 
a weapon itself. By striking the butt of the rifle deeply into 
the hollows of a man’s back you will be able to stun him. 
By striking the same hollow with the toe of the rifle, you’ll 
likely kill the man. 
Knives 
Probably the most commonly used weapon outside of a 
firearm is a knife, and at the same time it is perhaps the 
most misused weapon of all. More freedom fighters have 
died through stupidity and lack of training than all the other 
causes put together. Of course your enemy is going to 
kick a knife from your hands if you extend it out in front 
of you. Exactly the same situation with a handgun; a pistol 
should always be kept at the hip and out of the possible 
grasp of the enemy. An important factor in employing a 
knife as a weapon is the grip which you will use. The best 
over-all grip is as follows: Lay the knife handle diagonally 
across the palm of your outstretched hand. Now, with your 
thumb and forefinger grip each side of the handle, just 
beneath the guard, but do not encircle it. With the rest of 
your fingers grasp the remaining portion of the handle and 
encircle it. 
Figure 20. The correct grip for holding a knife. 
82 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
This type of grip allows you to maneuver the knife in 
most directions easily and quickly. The stance for a knife 
fight is just as important as the grip on the knife itself. 
You should get into a half crouch, feet spread shoulder 
width apart, putting all your weight on the balls of your 
feet. If you are right-handed, then your right foot should 
be just behind the left. The knife should be held close to 
the hip and out of the reach of the enemy. 
When attacking with a knife, there are certain vulnerable 
spots you should try for. These will result in death or 
severe injury. 
Throat: The throat is one of the most vulnerable spots 
in the body and should be treated as such. Any person 
who has the smallest idea of what’s going on will defend 
his throat well. If you see an opening, or are able to manu- 
facture one with your free hand, then there are two basic 
forms of attack. If the enemy is overprotective about his 
throat, do not pursue the issue, look for another point of 
attack. In no circumstances risk your own balance for an 
attack you may not be able to complete. The first type of 
attack to the throat area is a straight upward thrust to the 
hollow at the base of the neck, about an inch below the 
Adam’s apple. This will cause immediate death, since the 
thrust will sever the jugular vein. The second type of attack 
is a slash movement to either side of the throat. This will 
result in cutting the carotid artery, which carries blood to 
the brain. A slash of this type will cause death in a few 
seconds. Since the throat is so vulnerable, it will in most 
cases be well defended. It is sometimes better to wound an 
enemy in another spot first, so as to cause him confusion 
and the dropping of his throat defenses. 
Stomach: The stomach should be considered more of a 
diversionary tactic, than a fatal end in itself. Although a 
deep stomach wound will result in death if left unattended, 
a great tactic is to employ a combined thrust and slash to 
the stomach. This will result in confusion and fear. His 
confusion may cause him to drop his throat defense and 
try to protect the already-inflicted stomach wound. 
Heart: The heart is another fatal spot to be considered in 
your attack, but it should be noted that the heart is well 
protected by the rib cage, and is pretty hard to hit. A sharp 
thrust will usually slip off the rib cage and penetrate trie 
heart. This will result in death instantly. This type of thrust 
should incorporate an upward swing. 
Wrist: This is an excellent place to consider, especially 
if your enemy tries to grab for the knife, your arm, or a 
piece of clothing. A slash to the inside of the wrist will cut 
the radial artery, which is only a quarter inch below the 
skin surface. With a severed radial artery, a man will lose 
consciousness in about thirty seconds and die within two 
minutes. 
Upper arm: The upper arm is as vulnerable as the wrist, 
in that a well-placed slash will sever the brachial artery and 
cause death in about two minutes. A slash should be used 
on the upper inside arm regions, since a thrust would give 
you less of a chance of making the desired contact. If a 
thrust is unsuccessful, it will tend to thro\y you off balance, 
and leave you open to attack. 
Inside upper leg: A slash combined with a thrust move- 
ment directed to the inside of the leg just below the groin 
will result in severing some very large arteries, and will 
render the limb useless. 
Kidneys: This type of attack can only be launched from 
the rear of the enemy, and is especially effective for mis- 
sions that require absolute silence. One should launch the 
attack when he is about five feet from the back of the vic- 
tim. Then, with one movement, he must simultaneously 
thrust the knife deep into the kidneys and cover the vic- 
tim’s mouth with his free hand. After a few seconds, he 
should remove the knife, slashing as it is being retracted, 
and then cut the victim’s throat. By the time his throat is 
being cut. the victim should already be dead, but everything 
must be insured. 
Collar thrust: The subclavian artery is located about 
three inches below the surface of the skin, between the 
collar bone and the shoulder blade. When attacking this 
point, you must come up from the enemy’s rear, holding 
the knife as if it were an ice pick. You must thrust straight 
down into the indentation by the side of the neck. A good 
policy to follow when employing this form of attack is 
to cover the victim’s mouth and nose, to avoid any un- 
necessary noise. This artery is difficult to hit, so when 
withdrawing the knife use a slashing motion, to make the 
wound larger and insure that you have severed the artery. 
Once it is severed, the enemy will die almost instantly. 
There is nothing funny about killing a man, and these 
methods are not a joke. They work, and are being used 
today by the Army, Marines, and Special Forces, in South- 
east Asia. When attacking or being attacked, remain as 
calm as possible. Do not lose your head, through anger or 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS / 83 
few. A freedom fighter’s worst enemies are his emotions. 
Watch your opponent’s actions, try to guess what his next 
move will be, and prevent him from making it. I have no 
patience with a man who agrees that he is threatened, but 
refuses to protect himself, because he is disgusted with, or 
afraid of, violence. Everyone feels fear, and the brave are 
only those who can think logically and calmly about their 
fear, placing it in its proper relation to the matter on hand. 
The phrases “Dirty Fighter,” or “no hitting below the 
belt,” are for children or sportsmen. Violence is a deadly 
serious adult operation, with no room for second thoughts. 
The act of silencing sentries is especially important when 
involving oneself in a guerrilla struggle. This type of at- 
tack will be used many times in ambushes or sabotage at- 
tempts. The primary key to this type of attack is speed and 
silence. Any of the above attacks, which are based on ap- 
proaching the enemy from the rear, can be employed to 
silence a sentry or guard by simply covering his nose and 
mouth with your free hand, while thrusting the knife into 
one of the fatal spots with the other. An interesting and ef- 
fective method is to use the enemy’s weapon against him- 
self. You approach the guard from behind, and simultan- 
eously deliver a rabbit punch to the nape of his neck, and 
grab the front of his helmet and pull sharply back. Now, 
if his helmet is strapped on, this will cause his neck to 
break, with instant unconsciousness, followed by death. 
If his helmet is not strapped on, the chances are good that 
your rabbit punch will render him unconscious, but, to 
make sure, follow through with the free helmet and 
crack his skull open with it. This operation can be per- 
formed fast enough so that the guard will not have a chance 
to cry for help. 
Impromptu weapons 
The main point in any hand-to-hand combat situation is 
for the individual to assess the problem at hand and use 
the operation he believes will result in the type of effect 
desired. The training of any guerrilla should incorporate a 
real balance between self-confidence and fear. Always re- 
member that your enemy will know what he is doing, and 
most of the time better than you do. For this reason it is 
better to have an advantage to begin with, whether it be 
a weapon, or just the element of surprise. A guerrilla fight- 
er has to be the most ferocious fighter in the world; because 
in the established legal terms, he has committed high trea- 
son, and will not be taken prisoner. If a guerrilla is caught. 
he must expect torture and death. This is one of the real 
advantages in the liberation struggle. 
In this section I have included several recipes for hand 
weapons, which tend to be both semilethal and lethal. 
There are also a couple of recipes for sabotage, which 
didn’t fit into any other chapters. 
One of the simplest and most effective weapons in this 
class is the old-fashioned hatpin. It is about three to four 
inches in length with a plastic knob on one end. It can be 
purchased from almost any five-and-ten-cent store. This 
can be used as a lethal silent weapon, as illustrated by the 
following true story. A revolutionary group in Ireland was 
being threatened by an informer, who had gone over to the 
enemy. They knew that he had to be exterminated, for the 
safety and morale of the entire band. He was heavily 
guarded, but, through some surveillance work, they man- 
aged to find out where he ate, the times of his meals, and 
the number of guards. One day, while the informer was 
eating, a member of the guerrilla force unknown to the in- 
former entered the dining room and sat down next to him. 
He ordered food so as to place the guards at ease, and then 
ran a four-inch hatpin into the informer’s ear. The pin went 
directly into his brain. He died instantaneously, soundless- 
ly, and with what would appear to be a heart attack. The 
assassin left the eating place, with impunity, as he had 
propped the dead man up, and wandered back to his base 
Old-fashioned hatpins are among the easiest weapons to 
conceal. 
When martial law is declared, all weapons, except those 
that are well hidden, will be confiscated. Therefore, im- 
promptu weapons must be created. This is a good recipe 
for a hand-to-hand combat weapon which has proven ef- 
fective at several demonstrations. All you need to make one 
of these weapons is an empty beer or soda can and a 
can opener. With the can opener fray the two ends of the 
can outward, into a maze of jagged points. To put into 
operation, tape the center section with electrical tape, to 
form a good grip, and swing the can back and forth in 
front of your adversary. 
84 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
Knives are an essential tool as well as weapon for any 
person aspiring to be a guerrilla. There are many types of 
knives, and all have different purposes and uses. The knives 
I am going to discuss will be those that can be employed 
both as tools and weapons, with the maximum amount of 
efficiency. The sheath or hunting knife is a primary tool 
for any rural or urban guerrilla. The best types are the ones 
designed for use by the military themselves. The knife 
illustrated in Figure 23 is the Marine Corps combat knife, 
which has a sturdy seven-inch blade, and a leather, grooved 
handle for sure grip. The blade is covered with a water- 
resistant substance, which prevents rusting or corrosion, 
but doesn’t interfere with the use of the blade. This is one 
of the best knives on the market. 
Figure 23. Marine Corps combat knife. 
Another extremely dependable knife is the Air Force 
survival kit. This is more than just a knife, it is a kit, which 
includes a five-inch blade with sawteeth on the back. It 
has a heavy hexagon butt which can be used for a hammer, 
and a grooved leather handle for sure grip. It comes with a 
leather pouch which houses a sharpening stone. It is pic- 
tured in Figure 24. 
Figure 24. Air Force survival kit. 
Another type of sheath knife is the throwing knife. This 
is a great weapon, only if the person is trained with it. Do 
not take the chance of using one of these without the skill 
acquired by much practice. Another important disadvant- 
age to the throwing knife is that it is just a throwing knife 
and cannot be used for any other purposes because its 
edges are generally pretty dull. If you have the skill and 
know-how to throw knives, this can be a silent and deadly 
weapon. These are relatively inexpensive, but need- to be 
sharpened often. 
Figure 25. Throwing knife. 
Figure 25 depicts a typical inexpensive throwing knife; 
it is ten inches long and perfectly balanced. It has a leather 
handle, which insures a good grip in almost any situation. 
Watch out for wooden handles for just that reason. 
The three types of knives illustrated are about the best 
for combat in either rural or urban environments. Bayon- 
ets and machetes can and should be employed in rural 
areas, but they are much too large for combat or tool use 
in the cities. The knives discussed on the previous page are 
available from almost any Army-Navy store without re- 
strictions, except that in some areas they will ask you your 
age. 
Switchblades (spring-operated pocket knives) and stil- 
ettos (also spring-operated pocket knives, except the blade 
shoots straight out the handle) are effective in the sense 
that they can be employed with great speed, but in my 
mind their disadvantages override any effectiveness. First 
of all there is no way to open them if the spring breaks, and 
it seems that in a real emergency little things like springs 
always break. The second disadvantage is in their size. 
They are usually pretty small, but there are larger ones 
which tend to be slower and much more prone to breakage. 
Third, they are illegal, and who wants to go to jail for 
carrying an ineffective weapon? There is a general rule 
which applies to most tools and weapons; the fewer moving 
parts the better the weapon. 
An important factor with any weapon is the psycho- 
logical effect it will have on the enemy. Therefore any type 
of odd-shaped knife is a good weapon; the more brutal 
looking the better. A curved carpet cutter is a good ex- 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS / 85 
ample of this. Although a straight razor falls into this 
'classification, it is one of the worst weapons in the world. 
A straight razor has no lock, and the blade can flip back 
and cut off the holder’s fingers. Also stay away from gar- 
bage like icepicks, car antennas, bicycle chains, and all the 
rest of the street-gang bullshit. None of these weapons is 
effective, and the chances are very good that your enemy 
knows it. 
Brass knuckles and clubs 
There are several other weapons which are extremely 
effective in hand-to-hand combat. The weapons I will dis- 
cuss on the next couple of pages are in the club family. 
Most of the ones illustrated and described are police 
weapons, since the police have the most effective ones. 
There is a very common misconception that clubs are not 
lethal weapons. They are lethal in the sense that, if you 
whack someone over the head with a club, the chances are 
50-50 that his head will either crack or smush. 
Brass knuckles are an extremely effective semilethal 
weapon, for use in hand-to-hand combat. They are easy 
to make, although they are also inexpensive, if you can 
find them. They are illegal in most states. There are several 
types of brass knuckles. The first and most common is 
illustrated in Figure 26. 
Figure 26. Brass knuckles. 
It is nothing more than a metal bar, that can fit onto 
the hand, connected with four ringlike holes for the fingers. 
The other types include the Kelly Come Along (Figure 27) 
Figure 27. Kelly Come-Along. 
and sap gloves (Figure 28), which are nothing more than 
a pair of leather gloves with a metal bar sewed into them, 
either over the knuckles or palms. 
In Figure 29, all the billies on the left are legal, in the 
sense that a civilian may possess them. The flat slappers, 
brass knuckles, sap gloves, and Kelly Come-Alongs are 
illegal to all but police officers. The billies can be bought 
without restriction at almost any Army-Navy store. 
Cattle prod 
Another great weapon against horse guards is what the 
farmers call a cattle prod, and the police call a “mob- 
control stick.” These are devices that look very similar to 
a billie club, except at one end they have two rather long 
prongs, which transmit a relatively low voltage shock. Al- 
though the shock is low voltage, it’s enough to throw a 
rider from his horse, or completely confuse an attacker, to 
the point that he is helpless. These are available from 
Continental Telephone Supply Co., 17 W. 46th St., New 
York, New York, for under ten dollars. The police version 
is illustrated in Figure 30. 
* : — "i_J 
Figure 30. Mob-control stick. 
Garrote 
A weapon which is definitely considered lethal is the 
garrote. This is an ultra-effective device for beheading 
people. It incorporates all the facets which make up a great 
weapon: speed, silence, simplicity, and deadliness. It is 
constructed from two pieces of wood with a section of 
piano wire attached. 
Upon approach, the hands are raised, crossed as the 
wire is brought forward, down, and over the head of the 
enemy. Thus at the back of the head the wires are crossed 
over and the left hand pulls to the left, and the right hand 
to the right. This is an extremely deadly weapon.

Flat Slapper 
These so-called flat slappers 
are leather billies, with a

Guerrilla training 
When discussing any type of weapon, the most import- 
ant factor is not the acquisition of that weapon, but rather 
its application. An example of this is present everyday in 
any slum neighborhood. The gangs of young kids that run 
around with their makeshift weapons could be one of the 
most potentially dangerous forces in America, if they only 
learned how to make full use of the weapons available to 
them. Every great political leader and powerful tyrant has 
realized the wealth of energy, courage, and blind cruelty in 
the age group between 12 and 16 years old. These kids 
aren’t scared, they have no concept of death, they love 
excitement, and with training could make the best com- 
mandos. Hitler used the young people of Germany in 
“Hitler Youth,” a young terrorist organization that was 
probably one of the most effective the world has even seen. 
Mao also employs 13- and 14-year-olds in his Red Guard, 
because they have not yet developed a conscience for their 
actions. The development of this age group has begun in 
the United States with polidcal involvement on a high 
school and junior high school level, but, at the same time, 
the energy present must not be drowned in dogma. It must 
be channeled through education into specialized fields, 
which will be necessary to the great change in store for 
them. 
Any moron can obtain weapons, but what he does with 
these weapons is the factor which will determine the suc- 
cess or failure of a particular operation. This is the major 
cause of the failure of the Minute-Men. They have the 
weapons, but not the training or the technical know-how, 
to be effective with them. Nkrumah, in his book on revolu- 
tionary warfare, basically outlines the types of training 
a guerrilla fighter should have. He says that, before any 
actual weapons or physical training begins, the recruit must 
be educated in the justness and the reality of his cause. This 
type of mental training, indoctrination, is very important, 
but at the same time is not easily accomplished. The un- 
trained recruit knows nothing of guerrilla warfare. All he 
understands is the oppression, the lies, and the bullshit 
that have been fed to him for so long. This is what the 
revolutionary force cannot resort to. They must create for 
the new recruits, as well as the older combat veterans, a 
brotherhood of truth, without dogma, relying on human 
passions, feelings, and the basic moral fiber of the indi- 
viduals. It is impossible to explain Mao’s principles to a 
14-year-old. For that reason, the educators of the revolu- 
tion must get rid of the archaic terminology, and speak to 
the people, rather than down to them. 
Untrained individuals must be trained in shooting rifles, 
pistols, and some small machine guns. This type of ballis- 
tics training includes not only shooting accuracy and marks- 
88 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
manship, but also safety measures, care and cleaning, and 
actual combat application. While the physical and technical 
training is going on, the educators must instill in the train- 
ees a discipline. This discipline must be an internal self- 
discipline for the survival of the group, in contrast to the 
external mechanical type of discipline that they are fighting 
against. The best type of training is actual combat with 
a guerrilla band, so, as soon as an individual has progressed 
far enough, he should be taken into combat, as an equal 
member of the band. In the training of a fighter, an attempt 
must be made to understand the common problems of the 
men. The most common of these will be fear. This should 
be talked about, and real attempts should be made at all 
levels to understand it, although cowardliness must never 
be tolerated. 
There is an extremely effective method for sabotaging 
trucks and other military vehicles. Two guerrillas stretch 
a heavy duty cable across a highway diagonally. They must 
pick a highway which is frequently used by the enemy. The 
cable can be attached to trees or poles placed there, for that 
purpose. Once the cable is pulled taut, the guerrillas must 
paint it black so it won’t show up in the vehicle’s head- 
lights. Now the guerrillas leave, insuring their safety. As 
the vehicle hits the taut cable, it will slide down the cable 
rather than breaking it, into a tree or well-placed mine. 
x' Tree 
Flow of Traffic 
There are five basic methods of obtaining weaporis (fire- 
arms). One can always purchase them. Although mail 
order gun selling is now illegal, many states are very len- 
ient on sale of weapons. Raiding arms depots is also very 
effective, but should only be considered when the guerrilla 
band already has enough weapons to sustain an attack of 
this size. Disarming police or military personnel is a good 
method. It also boosts the morale of the guerrilla troops. 
One can attempt to make firearms himself, but this should 
only be done if the individual has had prior training and 
knows exactly what he’s doing. A faulty weapon endangers 
the entire band. The cleverest and safest method of ob- 
taining weapons is to post a guerrilla as a worker in a 
munitions factory, and steal what is needed and leave the 
other weapons so damaged that they are useless. 
When discussing firearms, as with almost everything 
else in this book, I feel obligated to caution the reader 
against his own ignorance and carelessness. A gun is not a 
toy. A gun is not a plaything. Treat your weapon with re- 
spect, because the time may come when its proper use can 
save your life. This will probably sound corny, if you have 
not had experience with a gun. If you have had experience, 
you know it’s true. A few rules for the use of a weapon: 
1 . Treat your weapon as your most prized possession. 
2. Clean it regularly. 
3. Do not jokingly point a gun at anyone, including 
your enemy. 
4. Do not allow anyone but yourself to shoot your 
weapon. 
5. Understand your gun, to the point where it become^ 
an extension of yourself. 
6. Take pride in your abilities in regard to shooting, but 
in no circumstances boast about them. 
7. The guerrilla organization has no use for cowboys or 
hotshots. 
8. In most situations, shoot to kill, but there are cir- 
cumstances where a wounded man can cause more trouble 
for your enemy than a dead man.

Pistols and revolvers 
Every man in a guerrilla band should have as part of his 
basic equipment a handgun. The pistol or handgun, as with 
all firearms, should be of a type for which ammunition and 
parts are. readily available. Obsolete weapons should not 
be used. For this reason, using the same type as your 
enemy has great advantages. Do not get hung up with 
strange weapons. Stick with the simple regulation-type pis- 
tols and rifles. Do not use antiques. 
There are basically three types of pistols, the difference

being primarily in loading, and rapid fire. The type you 
won’t have to worry about is the muzzle loaders. The other 
two are the revolvers and automatic and semi-automatic 
magazine-type pistols. Both have advantages and disad- 
vantages. 
The pistols listed below are there for several reasons: 
They are used to a great degree by either the police or the 
military, they are powerful enough to have fairly good stop- 
ping power, their prices are not too outrageous, and spare 
parts and ammunition are pretty easy to come by.

There are several different types of slugs for each caliber 
weapon. The primary difference is in the shape of the nose 
of the slug (i.e., round nose, flat point, spire point, soft 
point, etc.). The dum-dum bullet is illegal, but many com- 
panies have attempted to incorporate some of the dum- 
dum’s characteristics without going to the point of becom- 
ing illegal themselves. The dum-dum is nothing more than 
a slug with a groove or cross filed on its nose. This is done 
so that the bullet will literally explode within the body 
of the victim. An interesting experiment with a dum-dum 
is to fire one at relatively close range at an old phone book. 
The front of the book will show a hole about the size of a 
quarter, whereas the back will be blown completely off 
and shredded into thousands of pieces. If the texture of a 
92 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
phone book is comparable to the texture of the h um an 
body, then you are able to project the impact of this type of 
bullet. 
It is easy to pick up a weapon and in a short while be- 
come a reasonably good shot. This makes it extremely easy 
for the virtually untrained individual to come to believe 
that he is an expert in ballistics. False confidence is as great 
a fault as no confidence at all. In the training of any free- 
dom fighters there must be a merger of fearlessness and 
intelligent caution. A dead man has no use for confidence 
or courage.

Holsters 
There are many types of holsters for these handguns. 
Each is designed with an individual purpose in mind. A 
good holster has to have three basic considerations: safety 
of the gun within the holster, security against loss of the 
gun, and speed in which the gun can be drawn into action. 
The holsters pictured below try to incorporate these three 
facets. I would warn against holsters with devices for quick 
draw. Devices always fail when you need them most. 
This is an excellent type of fast-draw holster. Many 
police and military installations have started using them. 
They have a small screw which places tension on the gun, 
making it impossible to fall out. $5.50 
Figure 42. Spring holster. 
This type has a leather strap which goes over the gun it- 
self to insure the security of the weapon. At the same time 
it slows down the act of drawing out the weapon, but not 
to the degree that it makes much of a difference. Priced at 
about $5.00

Rifles 
Rifles should be acquired by the same five methods as 
those recommended for hand weapons. Most of the safety 
principles that apply to pistols also apply to rifles, with 
the exception that rifles are much more important to the 
success of any guerrilla operation, because of their power- 
ful nature. Although pistols are extremely handy at close 
range and for self-defense, they become almost useless over 
longer distances, or when applied to almost any military 
operation. Every person, whether in wartime or not, should 
keep a pistol and a rifle in his house at all times. If a per- 
son is not going to protect himself, and wishes the govern- 
ment to do it for him, how can he complain when the gov- 
ernment decides to protect itself against him, and executes 
him? As perverted as man’s senses are, he must refer back 
to the basic laws of nature, and animal survival. This in it- 
self should show cause enough for every family to own a 
weapon with which it can protect itself. One of the greatest 
myths of all time is that so-called civilized man is no longer 
an animal, and for that reason can strive to disarm himself 
and grow fat with false concepts. He has used some sort of 
warped logic and agreed to hand over his security to a 
bunch of power-hungry individuals, who will use this se- 
curity and the helpless individual to any extent they wish. 
A true man, in the real sense of the word, is like a wild 
animal, in that his freedom, and the freedom of his family, 
is based on one factor: his ability to protect himself and his 
family from outside restrictions. It has got to the point in 
this country where men believe they are men, just because 
of their birthright. If that is true, then, by the same logic, 
an animal held captive in a zoo is still a wild free beast. A 
male must make himself a man, he must enable himself 
to stand up on two legs, unafraid because he has confidence 
in his own security and in his own power. There is no place 
for emotionally or politically cuckolded people in the so- 
ciety I speak of. Survival of the fittest. If we must have vio- 
lence, then let it be real violence, let it be for survival, and 
not halfway around the world for “ideals.” 
Emasculation, if allowed to take place, can lower a man 
or woman to the state of a domesticated, well-trained ani- 
mal: performing tricks, begging for food, and relying total- 
ly on an outside force for his right to survive. If a man 
doesn’t understand weapons and is frightened of them, his 
friends should teach him about them. They should not be 
condescending, but rather understanding; for the fault is 
not his, it is just a lie he has been made to believe. 
A revolution, peaceful or violent, or any form of change, 
is a gamble, and should be treated as such. I have never 
heard of a real gambler placing a bet if he didn’t feel that 
the odds were in his favor. How can a man face life without 
any odds in his favor? Governments have created popular 
lies to break the spirit of real men, to render them help- 
less, useless little creatures, to be manipulated like chess 
pieces. The government has cleverly perverted the indi- 
vidual’s concept of human dignity to its own use. Where- 
as once true human dignity stemmed from self-sufficiency 
and the sanctity of the human spirit, it is now measured in 
materials — how much a man makes, what he can afford, 
how much credit can he get, where he lives, and who he 
knows. If a man is to be a man, a free spirit unto himself, 
he must arm himself not only with weapons but with ideals 
and concepts he is willing to fight and die for. An animal 
will risk its life to preserve the life of its young. Human 
beings have been so warped that they will think twice about 
this primary reaction. 
The rifles described below are good in the same senses 
as the pistols were: availability of ammunition and parts, 
power, and ability to be transported over long distances. 
Lee-Enfield No. 1 and No. 4 .303-caliber bolt-action

A bolt-action rifle requires less maintenance and makes 
a better, sniping weapon than do most other types. About 
$100 should buy you a weapon (used) and 1,000 rounds 
of ammo. The bolt-action weapons listed below are military 
and can be picked up second-hand with considerable sav- 
ings, but, as with purchasing anything second-hand, ex- 
treme caution should be taken.

Although bolt-action rifles require less maintenance than 
most others, I have listed here a few types of lever-action 
weapons. All of these are pretty sturdy and inexpensive, 
and might be used interchangeably with a bolt-action wea- 
pon. I still recommend bolt action for over-all general use.

but effective lever-action weapon which comes in either 
of two calibers: .30 U.S. Carbine or 256 Magnum. It has 
a 4-shot clip, open sights, and a positive safety. Priced new 
at $75.00. 
The Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle: Savage offers 
a pretty good line of lever-action high-powered rifles. This 
model is an inexpensive one featuring all the standard cali- 
bers, and a 5-shot clip. Priced new at about $50.00. 
Winchester also offers a pretty good line of lever-action 
rifles, but it seems that they may be hung up with trying to 
create replicas of Wild West guns, rather than effective 
weapons. The model-94 is an effective, fast-action, 30/30 
Win., which holds 6 cartridges and sells for $100.

Although I stated previously that foreign weapons could 
bring on problems, in such areas as ammunition and re- 
pairs, I have listed below a few extremely good foreign 
semi-automatic and automatic weapons. Most of these 
weapons can be bought secondhand, and in most cases I 
have listed the average secondhand price. 
G-3 Assault rifle: This is a West German weapon, semi- 
automatic, with a 20-shot clip. The rifle and about 1 ,000 
rounds of ammo should not cost more than $300. 
The Colt AR-15: This is a rapid-fire close-range wea- 
pon, holding 20 rounds of 5.56 mm. (223 Rem.). This is a 
lightweight, very handy rifle. The rifle and 1,000 rounds 
of ammo should not cost more than $275.00. The Colt 
AR-15 and the G-3 are a great team together. 
BM-59 Assault Rifle: This is a 7.26 NATO weapon, 
based on the Ml Garand action. It has a 20-shot maga- 
zine. The rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammo should not run 
more than $250.00. 
M-l Garand Rifle: This is a standard military weapon, 
used in both World Wars and in Korea. It has semi-auto- 
matic action and uses 30-06 ammo. Beware of all but ori- 
ginal M-l’s. The rifle and 1,500 rounds of ammo in clips 
should cost around $200. 
M-l Carbine: This is also a military weapon, built for 
strength and endurance. The rifle, 1,500 rounds of ammo, 
plus 12 magazines of 15 rounds, plus 5 clips of 30 shots, 
should not run over $150.00. 
A M-l Garand rifle and a M-l Carbine make a good 
team together. 
Shotguns 
Most individuals who live in the country can tell you the 
advantages of owning a shotgun. The urban guerrilla, if 
working by himself, should not be bothered with a shot- 
gun, but get a pistol, which is much the better weapon. 
When guerrilla action has progressed to the point where 
cells have formed, and sabotage or ambush operations are 
being carried out, then the band should acquire several 
shotguns. A shotgun is a great weapon in many senses; 
when sawed-off it is a small but extremely effective wea- 
pon with a great deal of close range power, and it can 
easily be transformed into any number of other weapons, 
including brush cleaners and grenade launchers. 
Converting a shotgun into a 
grenade launcher 
A 12- or 16-gauge shotgun is propped up with a set of 
folding legs, so to form a tripod, with the butt of the gun 
being the third leg, at about a 45 -degree angle. The angle 
can be varied, for aiming, by moving the legs back and 
forth. To build a grenade launcher, one must take an open 
shell and remove all the shot. Once this is done, replace it 
with a smooth cylindrical stick, which has been cut down 
to a close fit. When the shell is loaded into the gun, the 
stick should extend out of the muzzle of the gun. To the 
extended portion, a flat rubber base should be fixed and a 
“Molotov Cocktail” placed on it. This will send the burning 
bottles over a hundred yards with a good deal of accuracy. 
This is a good weapon for encirclement. 
A “Molotov Cocktail” is a bottle filled with a flammable 
liquid such as gasoline, mixed with oil or soap powder 
to thicken it. A fuse, usually a rag soaked in gasoline, 
is attached to the cork, lit, and thrown. The bottle breaks 
on contact with another hard object, and the gasoline ig- 
nites, causing a burst of flame. These were used with a 
great degree of success in Hungary, against things as big as 
tanks. 
The shotgun is where you can save some money, for as 
a general rule shotguns tend to be cheaper than rifles. The 
Sears Model 200 is an adequate, well-balanced, medium- 
priced weapon, with all the basic safety features necessary. 
A 20-gauge usually runs about $85.00 new. Since shotguns 
are not military weapons, your local sporting goods dealer 
will have good information about them, as long as you 
aren’t black, Spanish, or a white freak. 
Silencers 
As almost everyone knows, silencers are illegal in vir- 
tually all the countries of the world, but then a true revolu- 
tionary believes that the government in power is illegal so, 
following that logic, I see no reason that he should feel 
restricted by laws made by an illegal body. More important 
than rationalizing illegalities are the precautions necessary 
when using illegal weapons. Silencers are very handy for 
snipers and night sabotage work, where the success of the 
entire mission relies on silence. There are many types of 
improvised silencers, which I will go into later in this sec- 
tion. A firearm silencer is defined legally as “any device for 
diminishing the explosive report of a portable weapon.” 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS 
/ 
99 
The really curious aspect of most legalities is the man- 
ner in which they are enforced. If you are arrested for pos- 
session of an illegal silencer (felony) you face charges not 
by the FBI, but rather by the Tobacco and Alcohol Divi- 
sion of the Internal Revenue Service, which is pretty 
strange. 
The principles of firearm silencers differ to some degree 
with the type of weapon and the type of silencer used, but 
basically the compressed gas principle is the same. The 
silencer is constructed with an expansion chamber which 
will contain and distribute the compressed gas which fol- 
lows the bullet. In most weapons, the gas escaping com- 
pression is what creates the explosive report. This contain- 
ment and distribution are attained by using a series of baf- 
fles, coupled with absorbent material so to break up the 
high pressure. The sound of most low-caliber weapons 
(.22, .25, .32, etc.) comes directly from this gas under high 
pressure. However, in larger weapons with a higher caliber, 
the noisy gas is joined by another noise, that being a sonic 
boom. Any projectile that moves faster than 1,100 feet per 
second will experience a sonic boom. There have been de- 
vices created which will not only take care of the com- 
pressed gas, but will also reduce the speed of the bullet to a 
subsonic level, thus getting rid of the boom. This reduc- 
tion in speed is made through several different methods. 
One which has been proven effective is drilling holes in the 
gun barrel, to bleed the weapon of some of its power. An- 
other method (which is a great deal safer, as drilling a hole 
can ruin a gun completely) is simply to handload the car- 
tridges to a lower velocity. The last method for reducing a 
100 / 
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
projectile to a subsonic level is to force it to pass through 
semi-solid material. This should be accomplished with ut- 
most care and skill. 
The recent popularity of spy movies has given silencers 
a great deal of credit which is not due them. Since the Na- 
tional Firearms Act of 1934, there has been no civilian ex- 
perimentation with silencers, so the type of silencers which 
are in illegal use today are basically the same ones that 
were used in the 30’s. This in itself offers some major dis- 
advantages, in that these devices are large and clumsy. The 
types of silencers used by James Bond and other super- 
spies are physical impossibilities, just because of their size. 
There are other disadvantages to silencers which make 
them impractical for use on certain weapons; for example, 
the luger pistol operates on a recoil principle, and by plac- 
ing a heavy silencer on the end of the barrel, you will cause 
the gun to malfunction, as the barrel will be too heavy to 
recoil. Another example of the impracticalities of certain 
silencers is the case of gas-operated weapons, where the 
barrel is drilled full of holes, or shortened to release the 
compressed gas. What may happen is that the gas will 
ease out under little or no pressure and the shot will not be 
fired. 
How to build a silencer for a pistol 
If one were to employ a silencer on an automatic wea- 
pon, he should be especially careful, since the absorbent 
material used is not manufactured to withstand the heat of a 
steady blast from an automatic weapon. All of these fac- 
tors should be taken into consideration before attempting 
to build a device of this nature. 
Following are illustrations and descriptions of a few 
basic firearm silencers, but I must repeat the necessity for 
caution, not only because of possible legal reprisals, but 
also because, if you do not know what you are doing, the 
chances are extremely great that you will blow your head 
off. 
In Figure 62 is shown an autoloading military issue .22 
caliber pistol. The barrel casing has been removed, and 
the barrel has been turned down to its minimum thickness. 
Four rows of eleven holes have been drilled to permit the 
compressed gases to bleed out, so making this a silent, sub- 
sonic weapon. To complete the building of this silencer, all 
one would have to do is wrap several layers of wire screen- 
t 
ing around the barrel and cover with an outer metal casing 
which would extend longer than the barrel itself. This sec- 
tion in front of the barrel is packed with washers stamped 
out of the same wire screen, and finally capped with a 
screw-on metal washer. This silencer will make a .22 sound 
like a BB gun. 
On the next two pages I have illustrated an extremely 
simple silencer, which can be used both with automatic 
weapons and semi-automatic weapons. “A” is a Thomp- 
son Submachine Gun with the silencer attached, and “C” is 
the M-3 Submachine Gun with the silencer attached. “B” b 
a cross-section view of the Thompson silencer, which also 
applies to the M-3.

In diagram “B,” you can see that the silencer functions 
with a great similarity to the auto-loading .22 silencer in 
Figure 62. It is constructed with, two tubes — a large rear 
one and a smaller front one, which join in the middle with 
an adapter. The larger rear tube encases the barrel, which 
has four rows of four holes drilled in it. Surrounding the 
barrel are several layers of bronze screening and then the 
large metal tube. The smaller connecting front tube houses 
250 of the screen-type washers, with a screw-on cap at the 
end to keep the washers in place. The washers must have 
their holes large enough and in direct line with each other, 
so that the bullet can pass through without touching any 
of them. As a general rule for the construction of firearm 
silencers, one could say that it is unadvisable to bring the 
bullet into contact with the silencer itself. However, certain 
supersonic silencers do require this. The type of silencer 
works well, since it is used with weapons that employ .45 
acp, which is subsonic and doesn’t need to be reduced in 
velocity. 
Most states have pretty strict regulations about the pos- 
session of machine guns — even small ones — so you had 
better check all the angles, before screwing yourself into 
jail. 
How to build a silencer for a 
submachine gun 
The Viet Cong have adapted this type of submachine- 
gun silencer for their combat situation and, in doing so, 
have made it much more effective and simple to build. The 
first and larger tube (160 mm. long and 40 mm. in dia- 
meter) is filled with bronze screening the same as pictured 
in Figure 63, except they have added oil-soaked cotton, 
and then attached it to the gun barrel. This oil-soaked cot- 
ton acts as a cooling agent, which is very important to 
consider when dealing with automatic weapons in a combat 
situation. The second smaller tube (170 mm. long and 30 
mm. in diameter) is stuffed with a roll of bronze screening, 
which is much simpler than washers. The silencer is about 
70 per cent effective, meaning that it cannot be heard over 
a distance of 300 to 400 yards, which is a fantastic ad- 
vantage for the guerrilla fighter. 
There are many claims for improvised silencers. At 
this point I have not had the chance to experiment with, 
or try, any of these, but many of them sound as if they 
should have some degree of validity. 
1. Take a section of metal tubing and fill it with bottle 
caps, which have an “X” cut in the center of each and the 
flaps bent back, so as to form a small triangular passage- 
way for the bullet. 
2. A rubber nursing bottle nipple with an “X” slit in the 
top of the nipple, then placed over the end of the barrel, 
reportedly reduces the sound of the shot, but this type is 
only good for one shot. 
3. One effective silencer was made from a row of wash- 
ers attached to a welding rod and fitted with an outside 
casing. 
4. It has been said that a balloon strung over an egg- 
beater-type wire frame was good for one shot. 
Bows and arrows 
A bow and arrow has been proven to be an effective 
weapon even today, with all our supertechnology. The 
great advantage to the bow and arrow is silence. One can 
snipe without being seen or heard. A long or so-called 
straight bow is large and bulky. Therefore, I recommend a 
crossbow if you are to use any. A crossbow can be pur- 
chased through a sporting goods store or through mail 
order, even though crossbows are illegal for hunting in 
many states. A crossbow is not a toy. It is a deadly wea- 
pon and should command the same respect as a firearm. 
Always unstring your bow after use. If it is a wooden bow, 
keep it in a dry place to prevent warpage. Check all arrows 
and bolts before purchasing them for warpage. This can be 
done by “sighting them.” This entails looking down from 
the feathered end to the tip, watching for any curvature 
that might exist. 
The crossbow illustrated in Figure 66 is a good one, al- 
though there are more powerful ones. It is capable of going 
almost completely through a large telephone book at 25

yards. One word of caution about a bow and arrow set, 
and that is that you must practice carefully before attempt- 
ing to use it as a weapon. Archery is a skill that is learned, 
and it is much harder than riflery. Although you don’t have 
to worry about recoil with a bow, you do have to worry 
about the insides of your wrists. 1 have seen a guy take all 
the skin off the inside of his arm with a careless shot. 
Fiberglass is better than wood, as it doesn’t warp. Get 
a bow with over 50 pounds pull, as anything less is for tar- 
get practice. The arrows or bolts themselves have many 
different points. Stick with a hunting tip. 
Chemicals and gases 
1 saw the corpse of my daughter Annie incinerated, and 
her sexual organs squandered and divided after her 
death by the Police of France. 
Antonin Artaud, Artaud Anthology 
The most simple chemical agent is either common pep- 
per or mustard powder. Both work pretty well at close 
range. If they are thrown into the eyes, or inhaled through 
the nose, they will cause confusion, temporary blindness, 
and an extreme burning sensation in the nasal passages. 
The major disadvantage of pepper or mustard powder is 
the manner in which they are projected. On the following 
pages is a method to produce an effective tear gas, which 
will act much more efficiently than either pepper or mus- 
tard. 
Many states have made tear gas illegal to possess, but a 
form of pepper gas is still available in small penlike con- 
tainers. These usually sell for under five dollars, and 
work very well — especially in an enclosed area. A direct 
spray from one of these devices will totally incapacitate a 
person. They are available in most novelty stores, particu- 
larly around Times Square in New York. 
The development of tear gas was a long step forward 
in the history of civilization. 
Robert Reynolds (President of Federal Laboratories, 
the world’s largest producer of tear gas) 
I was just rereading a manual on non-lethal police wea- 
pons for controlling mob action, and, just as every time 
before, it blew my mind. The police are really uptight about 
the recent rise in demonstrations and unrest. They have 
spent incredible amounts of money developing all types 
of weapons for control. They have a machine which can be 
driven into a riot area and in a matter of minutes fill a 
ten-block area, four feet deep, with a nontoxic colored 
foam. The foam will prevent movement on the part of the 
demonstrators, and the color will identify them later for the 
arrests. The police have also developed an even more 
frightening weapon. It consists of a truck with a loud- 
speaker on the top which can be driven into the riot area. 
A high-pitched sound, like a silent dog whistle, is broad- 
cast from it. This high-pitched sound cannot be heard, but 
it manages to jumble the brain and render the individual 
helpless — unable to move or think. Although it’s not per- 
manent, it’s still pretty frightening. The field in which these 
police scientists have made the most headway is with 
chemicals and gases. They have not stuck to non-toxic 
chemicals, but are using gases that permanently maim peo- 
ple. The redeeming feature is that these gases are not hard 
to make, and are available to everyone, although their pos- 
session is illegal in most states. 
How to make tear gas in your basement 
The method of making tear gas is so simple that anyone 
can do it. The two things to remember are care and cau- 
tion. You will need a certain amount of equipment but, 
just like the chemicals, it is available from any hobby shop, 
or home chemical supplier. If you don’t already own a gas 
mask, go out and get one. They are sold at Army-Navy 
stores for under ten dollars. Listed below are the materials 
necessary: 
1. Ring stand 
2. Alcohol lamp 
3. Flask (300-ml.)

Method for preparing tear gas: 
1. Work in a garage, or outside if possible — not in the 
kitchen. 
2. Mix ten parts of glycerine with two parts of sodium 
bisulfate, in flask (No. 3), and heat. Do not fill more than 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS / 
105 
one-third of flask, as mixture froths when heated. When the 
frothing begins, adjust heat. 
3. As soon as you see no more tear gas being generated, 
and solids beginning to be formed in the generating flask 
(No. 3), or a brown residue in the tube (No. 6), remove 
the heat source, with your gas mask on, and pour out the 
residue in flask. You must pour this outside. Do not pour 
down sink or toilet. 
4. Remove collecting jar (No. 17) and stopper it quick- 
ly. What you have collected here is tear gas. 
5. Do not attempt to make more than three ounces at 
one time. 
6. Make sure all joints are tight. 
Method to step up equipment: 
1. Metal base ring stands (1 and 11) are placed on 
working surface. 
2. Clamp and clamp holder (4 and 7) are placed onto 
ring stand ( 1 ) . 
3. Clamp and clamp holder (12) are placed on ring 
stand (11). 
4. Generating flask (3) is placed in clamp (4). 
5. Two pieces of rubber tubing (10 and 13) are con- 
nected to condenser (9). 
6. Condenser (9) is placed into clamp (12). 
7. Segment of glass tubing (6) is placed in rubber stop- 
per (5). 
8. Segments of glass tubing (15 and 18) are put into 
rubber stopper (16). 
9. Segments of glass tubing (20 and 23) are put into 
rubber stopper (21). 
10. Rubber stopper (5) is put into the mouth of the 
generating flask (3). 
11. Rubber stopper (16) is put into mouth of collecting 
bottle (17). 
12. Rubber stopper (21) is put into mouth of air trap 
bottle (22). 
13. Connect glass tubing (6) with condenser (9) and 
with rubber tubing (8). 
14. Connect condenser (9) with glass tubing (15) and 
with rubber tubing (14). 
15. Connect glass tubing (18) with glass tubing (20) 
and rubber tubing (19). 
16. Connect glass tubing (23) with glass tubing (24) 
and with rubber tubing (24). 
17. Connect rubber tubing (13) to a faucet. 
18. Put end of rubber tubing ( 10) into a sink or drain. 
19. Fill beaker (26) three-quarters full of water, and 
place glass tubing (25) in the water. 
20. Put ingredients into generating flask ( 3 ) . 
2 1 . Turn on water to rubber tubing (13). 
22. Light wick on alcohol heater (2) and place under 
generating flask (3). 
The best method for putting tear gas into operation is 
to place it under pressure in a glass vial or bottle. Then 
throw the bottle at the target you have in mind. The glass 
will break on contact and allow the tear gas to escape. 
Other successful methods have been proven, including 
compressing in an atomizer, aerosol can, or seltzer bottles 
and the like. 
Defense and medical treatment for gases 
The problem with gas (offensively) is that it is so easy 
to defend against, and chances are very good that the peo- 
ple you intend to use it against are prepared for it. At this 
point in the struggle, any urban or rural guerrilla should 
have a gas mask. Everyone should understand the simple 
procedures for the treatment of a gas victim. Everyone 
should be able to identify the type of gas being used against 
him, so as to determine the type of treatment, and the seri- 
ousness of the situation. These factors I will go into on 
the next few pages. 
There are five different types of gases used by the 
police at this point, and the effective forms of defense vary. 
A defense for one may cause more severe effects when 
used against another. Such is the case with vaseline. Vase- 
line works well against mace, since mace is a liquid, but it 
causes gases to adhere to the skin and thus results in more 
serious burns. 
Police have been using canisters that do not explode on 
contact with the ground, but rather when picked up after 
the initial impact. This causes the gas to explode directly in 
the individual’s face. Whereas a rubber gas mask is good 
protection against most types of gases, it is ineffective and 
Figure 67 . Equipment set up for preparing tear gas. 
NATURAL, NONLETHAL, AND LETHAL WEAPONS / 
107 
even dangerous if worn when nausea gas has been used. 
Wet paper towels and surgical masks can be used to ease 
breathing problems but are also ineffective against nausea 
gas. So the most important consideration before treating a 
gas or chemical victim is to determine the type of gas or 
chemical used. 
CS tear gas: This gas is dispensed in various-sized can- 
isters, plastic grenades, and fog machines, and can be 
sprayed over an entire area from a helicopter. When you 
are hit with this type of gas, you will suffer coughing, run- 
ning nose and eyes, burning of the eyes, a reddening of the 
exposed area, nausea, and in some cases dizziness. To re- 
lieve the burning and running eyes, wash them out with 
one part boric acid and three parts water. If boric acid is 
not available, use normal tap water. Standard eye drops 
can be used effectively. The next step in the treatment of 
CS gas is to get the actual gas off your skin. This can be 
accomplished by applying mineral oil to the exposed por- 
tions of your skin. If mineral oil is unavailable, use water, 
but directly after you have applied the water, wipe the en- 
tire exposed area, except eyes, with alcohol. This will re- 
lieve the sting by substituting a cooling sensation. If the al- 
cohol is not applied, the stinging and burning may last up 
to two hours, whereas the alcohol will cut the time down to 
a matter of minutes. A gas mask, or wet cloth or paper 
towel, can effectively be used against this form of gas. 
CN gas: This is basically the same as CS gas, but a much 
milder form. It comes in the same type of container and has 
the same type of effect, but it is not quite as unpleasant. 
The treatment is just washing the exposed portions with 
water. In most cases, the mineral oil and alcohol will not 
be necessary. 
Nausea gas: This is an extremely dangerous gas, as it 
is colorless and odorless. It does not affect the tear ducts, 
so chances are great that a person will not even know it has 
been used until it’s too late. It comes in the same type of 
containers as the CS and CN gas do. The effect this gas 
has is pretty bad. I’ve never been hit with this stuff myself, 
but I have spoken to some friends from the army, who 
have. They told me that nausea gas is the worst there is. A 
person exposed to it vomits instantly on inhalation, but it 
is not a normal form of vomiting. It is a result of a muscle 
contraction and is referred to as projective vomiting. Pro- 
jective vomiting is the ejection of the contents of the stom- 
ach over several feet. This can result in the ripping of the 
stomach or throat lining. As well as vomiting, the person 
experiences instant diarrhea. These are pretty disgusting 
symptoms, but on top of these the individual also loses the 
normal balance of his mind. He may find it extremely diffi- 
cult to perform normal functions, such as walking or run- 
ning. If a person has respiratory difficulties, he should be 
taken to a doctor immediately. There isn’t much you can 
do about nausea gas yourself, except wait for the symp- 
toms to go away. If the symptoms do not disappear or be- 
come more pronounced, get to a doctor. There is no pro- 
tection against this type of gas. Gas masks, if worn, should 
be taken off as soon as you realize that it is nausea gas, as 
you might choke on your own vomit. The only effective 
protection is just running like hell, and getting out of the 
area. Because there is no effective form of protection 
against nausea gas, its use is somewhat limited; since not 
even the president can order the wind around. 
Blister gas: This is even more strange and frightening 
than nausea gas but, thank God, it is a great deal rarer. I 
have had no experience with this form, but, from what I 
can gather, it is pretty foul. It causes blisters on the ex- 
posed portions of skin: They may come up in minutes after 
the initial exposure or they can take up to several days 
to appear. This type of gas does not affect the eyes or 
throat, so it may be difficult to know whether the gas is 
being used. The only protection against it is to cover up 
all portions of skin. This may include gloves, hats, band- 
ages, long pants, etc. (girls should never wear skirts to 
demonstrations). The treatment for blisters is applying 
mineral oil and keeping the blistered area from the air. Try 
to get to a medic or doctor immediately. Anyone blistered 
should keep off the streets, as the cops or military will be 
able to identify anyone with blisters. 
Mace: Mace is a liquid rather than a gas, and is used 
more on a person-to-person basis than in crowd control. It 
is made up of 10 percent CS gas, 70 percent a propellant 
agent (sodium bicarbonate), and 20 percent kerosene. 
The kerosene is the agent ingredient that causes the severe 
burning sensations. If you have been hit with mace, you 
know exactly what I am talking about. It feels as if you’re 
thrown into a blast furnace, while your eyeballs are ex- 
tracted from their sockets and submerged in a concentrated 
solution of sulfuric acid. The pain that mace causes is in- 
tense, and this in turn causes the breakdown of normal 
physical and mental functions, such as running. If you 
108 / 
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
are sprayed in the mouth, it may lead to uncontrolled con- 
vulsions. The treatment for a mace victim is as follows: 
Wash out his eyes with the same boric acid solution de- 
scribed in the section on CS gas, wash all exposed portions 
of his body with water, then apply rubbing alcohol to di- 
lute the kerosene and relieve the burning. The combination 
of ski goggles and a thin layer of vaseline covering the face 
has proven to work pretty well. The vaseline must be wiped 
off immediately after exposure. 
The thing to remember is that all these gases and chem- 
icals have been developed for use against Americans. The 
military isn’t using mace in Vietnam, but mace is being 
used in Watts and Harlem. Millions of dollars are being 
spent every year to find new ways to control the people 
who supposedly control the government. 
Figures 68 and 69 illustrate different forms of darts. 
These could be extremely effective for the guerrilla fighter, 
as they can be fired from an air gun with little or no sound. 
Figure 68 is especially interesting, as it shows the complete 
construction of a rapid injection dart, with a special com- 
partment for the “drug of your choice.” 
There is an old saying that “ignorance is no excuse.” 
Well, at this point one could take it a step further and sa> 
ignorance can be fatal. A young person today must have 
the technology and the know-how. Never before have self- 
sufficiency and education been so important, and they are 
virtually inseparable from survival.

DYE MARKER DART 
This dart is loaded with a nontoxic uranine dye — a 
bright yellow fluorescent color. It can be loaded with vari- 
ous liquids such as special stench liquids or vomit inducers. 
The uses of such a projectile are to mark or identify in- 
dividuals in a crowd where contact and arrest are imprac- 
tical. It has the effect of destroying anonymity. 
HYPODERMIC SYRINGE PROJECTILE 
Hypodermic syringes in dart form for animal control. 
This projectile can accurately deliver and inject a lcc dose 
into unapproachable animals. 
Pressurized ampules are available for loading by veterin- 
arians. The serum is injected by compressed air behind a 
piston after the needle has come to rest in flesh. The dart’s 
accuracy is a considerable factor in its usefulness. 
TRAINING DART 
This projectile is provided in similar weight and balance 
to the various “line” darts to give a similar trajectory pat- 
tern so that the trainee can get the feel of the gun without 
expending expensive rounds. It can be fired indefinitely at 
“soft” targets — a mat or pad is suggested as a backstop 
for training. 
TEAR GAS DART 
This dart is designed to carry 2.5 cc. of liquid tear gas 
that covers an area of 12 to 15" in diameter. It has a safety 
spring clip. The clip is withdrawn on loading, making the til l|Af 
projectile ready for firing. 
The tear.gas is extremely effective when applied to the 
person even if the hit is not in the direct area of the eyes. 
It’s practical to shoot at ranges from 10 to 50 yards.

chapter four: Explosives 
and Booby Traps 
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
/ 
111 
112 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
This chapter is going to kill and maim more people than 
all the rest put together, because people just refuse to take 
things seriously. The formulas and recipes in here are 
real, they can be made by almost anyone, and they can be 
performed in the kitchen. I offer a serious note of caution. 
The people in the house on 11th Street (killed in New 
York City early in 1970 in an explosion caused by bombs 
they were making) did not know what they were doing. 
Not only did they kill themselves, but also some innocent 
people. Ignorance thus not only becomes fatal and inex- 
cusable, but also criminal. If you are not absolutely sure 
of what you are doing, do not do it. The revolution has too 
many God-damn martyrs as it is. 
Explosives, if used with care and all the necessary pre- 
cautions, are one of the greatest tools any liberation move- 
ment can have. Ninety percent of all sabotage is based on 
some sort of demolitions, or booby traps. Most of the lethal 
weapons in the previous chapter rely on a small explosive 
charge. The actual application of explosives can be a really 
thrilling and satisfying experience. I have a friend who 
worked with demolitions in the Middle East, and he has 
told me on several occasions that an explosion for him was 
an experience very similar to a sexual orgasm. This may 
seem strange to anyone who has no experience with ex-- 
plosives, but in many regards it is absolutely true. An 
explosion is an amazing phenomenon. Coupled with the 
destruction of an object of popular hatred, it can become 
more than just a chemical reaction. It can take the shape of 
hope for a nation of oppressed people. It is a total sensual 
experience. It affects all the senses, and in primitive socie- 
ties was considered a God, and worshiped. If you have 
read about any guerrilla struggles, or experienced any, you 
will realize that an explosion has many effects, especially 
when it is controlled by the oppressed group. It will confuse 
the enemy, cause destruction and death, impress and fright- 
en the enemy with the power and technology of the people. 
Maybe I should clarify some points for my own moral 
conscience. These recipes are not in this book for use by 
a minority. I do not place them here to be used by fringe 
political groups. They are included in this book to edu- 
cate, since we have already decided that ignorance is inex- 
cusable, fatal, and criminal. They are for the people, rich 
and poor, right and left, black, Spanish, white, middle-of- 
the-road liberals, young and old. This is the type of training 
the forces of fascism, communism, and capitalism get. It is 
my belief that all the people should have access to these 
skills, to be able to repel these oppressive forces. 
Sometimes I wonder which side the so-called “liberation 
army” is on, meaning that I cannot understand any man 
who wishes to blow up department stores, unless he has an 
outstanding bill, but even then that’s carrying capitalism a 
bit too far. The real problem comes from the fringe politi- 
cal factions, who at this point are so alienatedirom the real 
people of America that they think they are living in Russia 
in 1917. All of the faction groups cause great strife for the 
forces that are. No longer can the arthritic armchair 
politicos blame all the unrest on Cuban infiltrators, or 
Canadian saboteurs. They are confused, poor bastards. 
They really think that the Black Panthers were going to 
blow up the Botanical Gardens. If that type of reaction 
was observed under the controls of a psychology lab, I am 
sure they would have a name for it. 
The important thing to remember is that this kind of 
reaction is madness, but an extremely clever and dangerous 
form. Madness creates its own fatal hubris, and will destroy 
itself; but sometimes it does need a push in the right direc- 
tion. 
There is a great misconception in some strata of our so- 
ciety that an explosion, wherever it goes off, is better than 
no explosion. I have spoken to many individuals who sub- 
scribe to this belief, holding that everyone is guilty of some- 
thing and must be punished for it. The corporations which 
support the war should be bombed, the liberals who will 
not get off their asses should be shot, the politicians who 
don’t care about the people must die, anyone who lives in 
the Middle West or South is a redneck and a potential 
threat to the revolution, etc. This may be hard to appre- 
ciate, but it is nevertheless true. Let us take as an example 
an individual who wished to destroy the Roman Catholic 
Church. He would not only be a fool, but a murderer, 
if he threw a bomb into a full church on Sunday morning. 
A much more intelligent and effective approach to the 
problem would be a well-placed rumor, defaming the Pope, 
so that the Catholic people themselves destroyed their own 
church. 
When I use the term revolution, I do not use it in the 
same context or with the same meaning of Che Guevara, or 
Lenin, or anyone else. I see “the revolution ” as a human- 
istic change, which may or may not incorporate violence. 
It must be a revitalization of the American system to take 
us back to the real moral and political principles adopted in 
1 776. Maybe I am not a revolutionary, but then it’s all 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 113 
terminology, and more intolerance has sprung out of se- 
mantic misunderstandings than any other cause. 
A freedom fighter, whether working within or outside 
the system, must be a pragmatic opportunist, meaning that 
he must be able to see his advantages, in any situation, re- 
gardless of how bad conditions may seem at first. A free- 
dom fighter can never surrender, for if he does he becomes 
part of the problem. As for the guerrilla, the violent free- 
dom fighter, there is no trial in times of trouble — just tor- 
ture and death. 
There are individuals, in our society, who claim that we 
cannot exist without oppression and regulation, because we 
are children. I agree that we are children, because we have 
always had supervision, and have never been allowed the 
freedom to see ourselves in a different light. We are all 
children of the humanistic revolution, and, whether certain 
individuals like it or not, American children are growing 
up, fast. 
Explosives fall into two basic classes. The first is high 
explosives, which include dynamite, TNT, nitroglycerine, 
and plastique. The second class is low explosives, which 
have less of an explosive report and power than the higher 
class. The low explosives include smokeless powder, black 
powder, and other less powerful chemical reactions. I will 
deal with each class separately, starting first with high 
explosives, and then going on to the lower ones. Following 
this, I have included a very important section, that must be 
read. This is the safety precautions for and methods of 
handling the different forms of explosives. Following the 
safety precautions is a section on actual application of 
demolitions and booby traps. I would like to make it clear 
that no part of this chapter should be used without first 
reading and studying the rest of it. 
How to make nitroglycerin 
Almost all modern explosives are a derivative of a nitric 
acid base. Although fuming nitric acid (98 percent solution 
in water) is not an explosive in itself, it is explosive when 
mixed with many other compounds. This process of mix- 
ing a compound with nitric acid chemically is called the 
nitrating principle. The best-known nitrating agent is gly- 
cerin, but many others can be and are used. Mercury, 
sugar, cork, wheat germ, sawdust, starch, lard, and indigo 
are all common nitrating agents and are used in modern 
industry. For example when sawdust is nitrated, it be- 
comes nitrocellulose, and is used in smokeless powder. 
Mercury fulminate ( nitrated mercury ) is a very powerful 
and effective detonator. 
The next recipe is for nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a 
high explosive, with an incredibly unstable nature. It can 
explode for the most minute reasons, such as a change of 
one or two degrees in temperature, or a minor shock. Be- 
cause of nitroglycerin’s unstable nature, I would suggest 
that only people with an extensive background training in 
both chemistry and explosives try this procedure. 
Nitroglycerin C 3 H 3 (NO a ) 
1. Fill a 75-milliliter beaker, to the 13 -ml. level, with 
fuming red nitric acid, of 98 percent concentration. 
2. Place beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below 
room temperature. 
3. After it is cooled, add to it three times the amount of 
fuming sulfuric acid (99 percent ITSO 4 ). In other words, 
add to the now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 milliliters of 
fuming sulfuric acid. When mixing any acids, always do it 
slowly and carefully to avoid splattering. 
4. When the two are mixed, lower their temperature, by 
adding more ice to the bath, to about 10 or 15 degrees 
Centigrade. This can be measured by using a mercury-op- 
erated Centigrade thermometer. 
5. When the acid solution has cooled to the desired tem- 
perature, it is ready for the glycerin. The glycerin must be 
added in small amounts using a medicine dropper. Gly- 
cerin is added, slowly and carefully, until the entire surface 
of the acid is covered with it. 
6 . This is a dangerous point, since the nitration will take 
place as soon as the glycerin is added. The nitration will 
produce heat, so the solution must be kept below 30 de- 
grees C. If the solution should go above 30 degrees, the 
beaker should be taken out of the ice bath and the solution 
should be carefully poured directly into the ice bath, since 
this will prevent an explosion. 
7. For about the first ten minutes of the nitration, the 
mixture should be gently stirred. In a normal reaction, the 
nitroglycerin will form as a layer on top of the acid solu- 
tion, while the sulfuric acid will absorb the excess water. 
8 . After the nitration has taken place and the nitrogly- 
cerin has formed at the top of the solution, the entire beak- 
er should be transferred very slowly and carefully to an-

other beaker of water. When this is done, the nitroglycerin 
will settle to the bottom, so that most of the acid solution 
can be drained away. 
V After removing as much acid as possible without dis- 
turbing the nitroglycerin, remove the nitroglycerin with an 
eyedropper and place it in a bicarbonate of soda (sodium 
bicarbonate) solution. The sodium bicarbonate is an alkali 
and will neutralize much of the acid remaining. This pro- 
cess should be repeated as many times as necessary using 
blue litmus paper to check for the presence of acid. The 
remaining acid only makes the nitroglycerin more unstable 
than it normally is. 
10. The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from the 
bicarbonate. This is done with an eye dropper, slowly and 
carefully. The usual test to see if nitration has been suc- 
cessful is to place one drop of the nitroglycerin on a metal 
plate and ignite it. If it is true nitroglycerin, it will burn 
with a clear blue flame. Caution: Nitroglycerin is extremely 
sensitive to decomposition, heating, dropping, or jarring, 
and may explode even if left undisturbed and cool. Know 
what you are doing before you do it. 
How to make mercury fulminate 
When employing the use of any high explosive, an indi- 
vidual must also use some kind of detonating device. Blast- 
ing caps are probably the most popular today, since they 
are very functional and relatively stable. The prime in- 
gredient in most blasting caps and detonating devices in 
general is mercury fulminate. There are several methods 
for preparing mercury fulminate. 
Method No. 1 for the preparation of mercury fulminate: 
1. Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix it with 35 ml. 
of nitric acid. 
2. The mixture is slowly and gently heated. As soon as 
the solution bubbles and turns green, one knows that the 
silver mercury is dissolved. 
3. After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured, 
slowly, into a small flask of ethyl alcohol. This will result 
in red fumes. 
4. After a half hour or so, the red fumes will turn white, 
indicating that ihe process is nearing its final stage. 
5. After a few minutes, add distilled water to the solu- 
tion. 
6. The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain 
the small white crystals. These crystals are pure mercury 
fulminate, but should be washed many times, and tested 
with litmus paper for any remaining undesirable acid. 
Method No. 2 for the preparation of mercury fulminate: 
1. Mix one part mercuric oxide with ten parts ammonia 
solution. When ratios are described, they are always done 
according to weight rather than volume. 
2. After waiting eight to ten days, one will see that the 
mercuric oxide has reacted with the ammonia solution to 
produce the white fulminate crystals. 
3. These crystals must be handled in the same way as 
the first method described, in that they must be washed 
many times and given several litmus paper tests. 
Many other fulminates can be made in the same manner 
as above, but I will not go into these, since most are ex- 
tremely unstable and sensitive to shock. All fulminates, in- 
cluding mercury fulminate, are sensitive to shock and fric- 
tion, and in no circumstances should they be handled in a 
rough or careless manner. 
How to make blasting gelatin 
One of the nearly perfect explosive compounds, in tin- 
sense of chemical combustion rather than stability, is bla-a- 
ing gelatin. This was discovered by Nobel, and is a very 
primitive form of plastique, as we know it today. It is mad. 
by mixing a small amount of nitrocellulose (nitrated saw- 
dust) with a larger amount of nitroglycerin. This creates a 
stiff, plastic substance which has power as an explosive 
greater than either of its ingredients. A person attempting 
to make this should use 92 percent nitroglycerin and 8 per- 
cent nitrocellulose, and pray. If you don't want to mes- 
with making nitrocellulose and have access to guncotton, i : 
can be substituted. Any recipe listed in this chapter which 
employs unstable or sensitive explosive compounds, such a> 
nitroglycerin, should be left alone by all those who do 
not have access to a laboratory or previous training. This 
book is noi enough training to mess with these compounds. 
Formulas for the straight dynamite series 
Probably one of the single greatest breakthroughs in ex- 
plosives came by accident, when Nobel discovered a prim- 
itive form of dynamite. One of the primary ingredients of 
dynamite is nitroglycerin, which has great explosive power, 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS

although it has the disadvantage of being ultrasensitive to 
heat and shock. What dynamite does, is to combine the 
high explosive power of nitroglycerin with a stabilizing 
agent, to render it powerful but safely usable. Nobel de- 
veloped what is called today the straight dynamite series, 
which is nothing more than nitroglycerin and a stabilizing 
agent. The most common straight dynamite formulas fol-

The figures given in the right column are percentage 
parts, adding up to a sum of 100 percent. Percentage parts 
are always based on a weight ratio rather than volume. 
When preparing any high-explosive formula, be sure you 
know what you are doing. Have the correct equipment, and 
the correct chemicals. Many of these chemicals are sold 
under brand names, which are more familiar than their 
chemical names, but, before assuming anything, read the 
ingredients, and take nothing for granted. 
These formulas listed above are for straight dynamite. 
Straight dynamite is a very primitive form of what we know 
today as dynamite. Later ammonium nitrate was added to 
the dynamite. This substance produced a greater explosive 
action, but less velocity. The intensification of the explosive 
action results because ammonium nitrate furnishes more 
oxygen for the dynamite. Ammonium nitrate has not only 
been used in dynamite, but also in many other different ex- 
plosive compounds, including NG., picric acid, and coal 
dust. Ammonium nitrate when mixed with these substances 
creates the cheapest form of high explosive known to man. 
How to make chloride of azode 
A good example of how ammonium nitrate can be chem- 
ically mixed with other substances, and impart its explosive 
qualities to these otherwise nonexplosive materials, is in 
the preparation of chloride of azode. 
1 . A quantity of chlorine gas is collected in a small glass 
beaker, and placed upside down on another glass beaker 
containing a water solution of ammonium nitrate. 
2. NoW the solution of ammonium nitrate is heated gent- 
ly. While it is being heated, the surface of the solution will 
become oily, and finally small droplets will form and sink 
to the bottom of the beaker. 
3. After this process is finished, remove the heat and 
drain off excess ammonium nitrate solution. The droplets 
that remain at the bottom of the beaker are chloride of 
azode of nitrochloride. Nitrochloride explodes violently 
when brought into contact with an open flame, or when 
exposed to temperatures above 212 degrees F. 
There are hundreds and hundreds of formulas for the 
use of ammonium nitrate, in different explosive com- 
pounds. The ones on the following pages are only the ma- 
jor, or well-known, ones. For further information, a chem- 
istry manual or handbook of explosives can be useful.

The formulas listed above are for high explosives. They 
ire not for cherry bombs or Roman candles. The ingredi- 
ents that make up these formulas have several functions: 
The first is the explosive agent itself, the second is the 
stabilizing agent, and the third is a texturizer (paraffin). 
Below are listed the most important and common ingredi- 
ents that are used to form an explosive compound, and a 
description of their purpose and function. 
Ammonium Nitrate 
An extremely unstable, white ex- 
plosive, usually in crystalline 
form. 
Aluminum 
...A silver metallic powder, when in 
pyro grade, it is a major ingredi- 
ent in many ammonal explosive 
compounds. 
Ammonium oxalate ... 
...A very valuable stabilizing agent, 
especially for NG. 
Barium nitrate 
Nitrated barium, in white crystal- 
line powdered form. 
Charcoal Powder 
...A fine black powder, which is ex- 
tremely absorbent, and used ex- 
tensively in pyrotechnics. 
Guncotton 
...Nitrated cellulose (sawdust) is 
fairly stable, but usually used with 
other ingredients rather than 
alone. It is about 13-14 percent 
nitrogen. 
Naphthalene 
...This is a sensitizing agent that is 
normally in a white crystalline 
form. 
Paraffin 
...This is a primary ingredient in 
plastique, and acts as a texturizer. 
Potassium nitrate 
An explosive compound in itself, 
which is stable. It is usually in a 
white crystalline form. 
Potassium perchloride 
...A white powder used as an ignit- 
ing agent in high explosives. It is 
an extremely common ingredient 
in low explosives. 
Xcun 
...A gummy substance, which is 
flammable, and used in high ex- 
plosives as an igniting agent. 
Sodium carbonate This white crystalline powder acts 
to neutralize acid, which may 
make the explosive more unstable 
than it normally is. 
Sodium chloride This is nothing more than ordin- 
ary table salt, and is used as a 
cooling agent in many high ex- 
plosives. 
Sodium nitrate A stable explosive compound 
which has the advantage of being 
water-absorbent. 
Sodium sulfate A stabilizing powder, which is 
water-resistant. 
Starch This can be either potato or corn 
starch, and acts as an absorbent 
in many explosive compounds. 
Sulfur A yellow crystalline powder, 
which should be used in flour 
form only. 
Vaseline A clear petroleum jelly used in a 
similar manner as paraffin, as a 
plasticizer, for many forms of ex- 
ploding gelatins and plastic ex- 
plosives. 
Formulas for gelatin dynamites 
The following few pages have some of the most import- 
ant formulas for gelatin and semi-gelatin dynamites. As 
with most of the explosive substances in this chapter, there 
are hundreds of different recipes. Each chemist claims he’s 
got the most powerful and safest recipe. What I have at- 
tempted to do is collect the most common industrial and 
military formulas, since these function in the correct con- 
text that this book is written.

How to make TNT 
Probably the most important explosive compound in use 
today is TNT (trinitrotoluene). This and other very similar 
types of high explosives are all used by the military, be- 
cause of their fantastic power — about 2.25 million pounds 
per square inch, and their great stability. TNT also has 
the great advantage of being able to be melted at 82 de- 
grees F., so that it can be poured into shells, mortars, or 
any other projectiles. Military TNT comes in containers 
which resemble dry cell batteries, and are usually ignited 
by an electrical charge, coupled with an electrical blasting 
cap, although there are other methods. 
Preparation of TNT 
1. Take two beakers. In the first, prepare a solution of 
76 percent sulfuric acid, 23 percent nitric acid, and 1 per- 
cent water. In the other beaker, prepare another solution 
of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent sulfuric acid (per- 
centages are on a weight ratio rather than volume). 
2. Ten grams of the first solution are poured into an 
empty beaker and placed in an ice bath. 
3. Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several min- 
utes. 
4. Remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat 
until it reaches 50 degrees C. The solution is stirred con- 
stantly while being heated. 
5. Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, 
are added and the temperature is allowed to rise to 55 de- 
grees C. This temperature is held for the next ten min- 
utes, and an oily liquid will begin to form on the top of the 
acid. 
6. After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned 
to the ice bath, and cooled to 45 degrees C. When reach- 
ing this temperature, the oily liquid will sink and collect 
at the bottom of the beaker. At this point, the remaining 
acid solution should be drawn off, by using a syringe. 
7. Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added 
to the oily liquid while the temperature is slowly being 
raised to 83 degrees C. After this temperature is reached, 
it is maintained for a' full half hour, 
8. At the end of this period, the solution is allowed to 
cool to 60 degrees C., and is held at this temperature for 
another full half hour. After this, the acid is again drawn 
off, leaving once more only the oily liquid at the bottom. 
9. Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily 
liquid is gently heated to 80 degrees C. All temperature in- 
creases must be accomplished slowly and gently. 
10. Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams 
of the second acid solution are added, and the temperature 
is raised from 80 degrees C. to 104 degrees C., and is held 
for three hours. 
1 1 . After this three-hour period, the mixture is lowered 
to 1 00 degrees C. and is held there for a half hour. 
12. After this half hour, the oil is removed from the acid 
and washed with boiling water. 
13. After the washing with boiling water, while being 
stirred constantly, the TNT will begin to solidify. 
14. When the solidification has started, cold water is 
added to the beaker, so that the TNT will form into pellets. 
Once this is done, you have a good quality TNT. 
Note: The temperatures used in the preparation of TNT 
are exact, and must be used as such. Do not estimate or use 
approximations. Buy a good centigrade thermometer. 
How to make tetryl 
The next two recipes are for the preparation of tetryl and 
picric acid, both of which are commonly used in com- 
pounds containing TNT. 
Method for the preparation of tetryl: 
1 . A small amount of dimethyllaniline is dissolved in an 
excess amount of concentrated sulfuric acid. 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
119 
2. This mixture is now added to an equal amount of 
nitric acid. The new mixture is kept in an ice bath, and is 
well stirred. 
3. After about five minutes, the tetryl is filtered and then 
washed in cold water. 
4. It is now boiled in fresh water, which contains a small 
amount of sodium bicarbonate. This process acts to neu- 
tralize any remaining acid. The washings are repeated as 
many times as necessary according to the litmus-paper 
tests. When you are satisfied that the tetryl is free of acid, 
filter it from the water and allow it to dry. When tetryl is 
detonated, it reacts in very much the same way as TNT. 
How to make picric acid 
Method for the preparation of picric acid: 
1 . Phenol is melted and then mixed with a concentrated 
solution of sulfuric acid. The mixture is constantly stirred 
and kept at a steady temperature of 95 degrees C., for 
four to six hours, depending on the quantities of phenol 
used. 
2. After this, the acid-phenol solution is diluted with dis- 
tilled water, and an equal excess amount of nitric acid 
is added. The mixture of the nitric acid will cause an im- 
mediate reaction, which will produce heat, so the addition 
of the acid must be performed slowly, but more importantly 
the temperature of the solution must not go above 110 de- 
grees C. 
3. Ten or so minutes after the addition of the nitric acid, 
the picric acid will be fully formed, and you can draw 
off the excess acid. It should be filtered and washed in the 
same manner as above, until the litmus paper tests show 
that there is little or no acid present. When washing, use 
only cold water. After this, the picric acid should be al- 
lowed to partially dry. 
Picric acid is a more powerful explosive than TNT, but 
it has disadvantages. It is much more expensive to make, 
and is best handled in a wet 10 per cent distilled water 
form, as picric acid becomes very unstable when com- 
pletely dry. This compound should never be put into direct 
contact with any metal, since instantly on contact there is 
a formation of metal picrate, which explodes spontaneously 
upon formation. 
How to make low explosives 
Up to this point, I have referred only to high explosives, 
but there are many formulas and recipes for low explosives, 
which, although they do not have the power or impact of 
the high explosives, are generally speaking safer to use 
and handle. It may seem at first that an explosive com- 
pound that has less power is a disadvantage, but this is not 
true. If a high-explosive charge were used to set off a 
bullet in a gun, the gun would probably explode in the 
user’s face. Therefore, low explosives have a definite pur- 
pose and use, and are not interchangeable with high ex- 
plosives. Although I stated above that, generally speaking, 
low explosives are more stable than high explosives, there 
are some low-explosive compounds that are as dangerous 
as high-explosive compounds, if not more so. Below is a 
chart of the most common low-explosive combinations and 
their stabilities and merit. 
Potassium and sodium nitrate gunpowders: These are 
without a doubt one of the safest low explosives to handle. 
They are especially good when packed into a tight contain- 
er, and exploded under pressure. 
Smokeless powder: This type of low explosive is^much 
like the one mentioned above, in the sense that it is ex- 
tremely stable, but it is much more powerful. It also needs 
the element of pressure in the actual demolition work. 
Potassium chlorates with sulfates: Any mixture of potas- 
sium or sodium chlorates should be avoided at all costs, 
since most combinations will explode immediately, on 
formation, and those that don’t are extremely unstable and 
likely to explode at any time. 
Ammonium nitrate with chlorates: This is similar to the 
compounds discussed above. These are extremely hazard- 
ous compounds, with very unstable ingredients. 
Potassium chlorate and red phosphorus: This combina- 
tion is probably the most unstable and highly sensitive of 
all the low explosives. It will explode immediately and vio- 
lently upon formation, even in the open when not under 
pressure. 
Aluminum or magnesium with potassium chlorate or 
sodium peroxide: Any of these combinations, although not 
quite as unstable as the one discussed above, is still too sen- 
sitive to experiment or play around with. 
Barium chlorate with shellac gums: Any mixture em- 
ploying either barium or barium nitrate and carbon, or 
barium chlorate and any other substance, must be given 
great care. Barium nitrate and strontium nitrate mixed to- 
gether form a very sensitive explosive, but the danger is 
greatly increased with the addition of charcoal, or carbon. 
120 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
Barium and strontium nitrate with aluminum and potas- 
sium perchlorate: This combination is relatively safe, as is 
the combination of barium nitrate and sulfur, potassium ni- 
trate, and most other powdered metals. 
Guanidine nitrate and a combustible: This combination 
of guanidine nitrate and a combustible (i.e. powdered anti- 
mony) is one of the safest of all the low explosives. 
Potassium bichromate and potassium permanganate: 
This is a very sensitive and unstable compound, and should 
be avoided, as it is really too hazardous to work with or 
handle. 
The low-explosive reaction is based on the principle of 
a combustible material combined with an oxidizing agent, 
in Other words combining a material that burns easily with 
another material which in the chemical reaction will sup- 
ply the necessary oxygen for the combustible’s consump- 
tion. Listed below are the most common low-explosive 
combinations of oxidizing agents aryl combustibles. The 
first ingredient listed is the oxidizer, and the second is the 
combustible: 
1. Nitric acid and resin. 
2. Bariijm nitrate and magnesium. 
3. Ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum. 
4. Barium peroxide and zinc dust. 
5. Ammonium perchlorate and asphaltum. 
6. Sodium chlorate and shellac gum. 
7. Potassium nitrate and charcoal. 
8. Sodium peroxide and flowers of sulfur. 
9. Magnesium perchlorate and woodmeal. 
10. Potassium perchlorate and cane sugar. 
1 1 . Sodium nitrate and sulfur flour. 
12. Potassium bichromate and antimony sulfide. 
13. Guanidine nitrate and powdered antimony. 
14. Potassium chlorate and red phosphorus. 
15. Potassium permanganate and powdered sugar. 
16. Barium chlorate and paraffin wax. 
The combinations that are most unstable and sensitive 
are Nos. 3, 5, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16. These should be avoided. 
Formulas for black powder 
Gunpowder is the great-granddaddy of all the rest of 
the high- and low-power explosives, and still to this day 
is one of the most important explosives. As with all the 
rest of the explosive formulas, it seems everyone has his 
own recipe, which he claims to be the best. 1 have collected 
11 of the safer, more functional, methods of preparing 
gunpowder. The most important thing to remember when 
dealing with black powder is its incredible sensitivity to 
sparks. Note: A cook, a book does not make.

When preparing black powder for use in firearms, it is 
important to keep in mind that these formulas are more 
powerful than ordinary potassium nitrate gunpowder, and 
for that reason smaller quantities should be used. The cor- 
rect amount can only be discovered by trial-and-error ex- 
perimentation, but caution must be taken to prevent over- 
loading. ' 
Although black powder is one of the safest explosives, 
it has disadvantages: It is extremely sensitive to sparks; 
and it leaves a messy residue in gun barrels, which neces- 
sitates frequent cleaning. The advantage of smokeless 
powder is that it is an extremely stable high-powered ex- 
plosive in the low-explosive class, which gives off only gas- 
eous products upon explosion. The first type of smokeless 
powder used by the army was basically nitrocellulose with 
a small amount of diphenyl amine, for stabilizer. Smoke- 
less powder is perhaps the safest of any explosive com- 
pound discussed in this chapter, and for that reason is ex- 
tremely popular today. 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
121 
How to make smokeless powder 
1 . Boil cotton for 30 minutes, in a 2 percent solution of 
sodium hydroxide. 
2. Wash the cotton in hot water and allow it to dry. 
3. Mix slowly and carefully at 25 degrees Centigrade, 
250 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, 150 cc. of con- 
centrated nitric acid, and 20 cc. of water. They must be 
kept at 25 degrees C. 
4. Next place the dried cotton in the acid solution, and 
stir well with either a glass or porcelain rod (do not use 
metal). This should be done for 35 minutes. 
5. After nitration, the acids are washed away, and the 
cotton is washed in boiling water five times, each time for 
25 minutes. The cotton is given several tests with litmus 
paper. If the litmus test proves that there is still some acid 
present, a 2 percent solution of sodium bicarbonate should 
neutralize whatever is left. This is important, since any re- 
maining acid acts as an impurity to make the explosive 
more unstable. 
How to make nitrogen tri-iodide 
Probably the most hazardous explosive compound of all 
is nitrogen tri-iodide. Strangely enough, it is very popular 
with high school chemists, who do not have the vaguest 
idea of what they are doing. The reason for its popularity 
may be the ready availability of the ingredients, but it is 
so sensitive to friction that a fly landing on it, has been 
known to detonate it. The recipe has only been included as 
a warning and as a curiosity. It should not be used. 
Preparation for making nitrogen tri-iodide: 
1 . Add a small amount of solid iodine crystals to about 20 
cc. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. This operation 
must be performed very slowly, until a brownish-red preci- 
pitate is formed. 
2. Now it is filtered through filter paper, and then 
washed first with alcohol and secondly with ether. 
Tri-iodide must remain wet, since when it dries it be- 
comes supersensitive to friction, and a slight touch can set 
it off. This is an extremely unstable compound and should 
not be experimented with. 
Formulas for different-colored 
smoke screens 
An interesting aspect of explosives is the extra ingredi- 
ents which can be added to give the explosion character- 
istics it would not normally have. A smoke bomb is like 
this, in the sense that it is not only useful to create con- 
fusion and chaos, but also for smoking persons out of an 
enclosed area, as well as signaling.

Safety precautions 
The next few pages are the most important in this chap- 
ter. More people, young and old, political and apolitical, 
have executed themselves with some form of explosives 
than I would care to state here. The safety procedures for 
all explosives are nothing more than common sense and 
reasoning. Yes, smokeless powder is stable, but if you put 
it in the oven, it will explode. That may sound stupid, but 
a 14-year-old in Ohio did it two years ago and killed him- 
self. Plastique is a very stable explosive compound, but it 
needs to be softened before use. Some guy in New Jersey 
softened his plastique with a hammer, and he is no more. 
TNT can be burned and it will not explode — most of the 
time — whereas gunpowder will ignite with the smallest 
spark. Moral: Read the next few pages and study them, do 
not assume anything. 
Safety precautions for the storing of explosives: 
1 . The most important factor in picking a storage place 
is its location. You will want the place close enough to be 
under your surveillance, but not close enough to be a haz- 
ard to you or your family. All explosive magazines or 
dumps must have secure locks on all the doors. 
2. Do not store blasting caps, electrical caps, or primers 
in the same container or even the same magazine with any 
other form of high or low explosives. 
3. Do not store fuses or fuse lighters in a wet or damp 
place, or near the storage of flammables such as oil, gaso- 
line, cleaning solvents, or paints. Fuses should also be kept 
away from radiators, steam pipes, stoves, or any other 
source of heat, because the very nature of nonelectrical 
fuses is such that any one of these things could start a 
large fire. 
4. Metals should be kept absolutely away from explo- 
sives, meaning that metal tools should not be stored in the 
same magazine with explosives. 
5. In no circumstances, allow any open flame or other 
fire, including a lighted cigarette, around an explosive stor- 
age dump. 
6. Spontaneous combustion is a real problem when stor- 
ing explosives. For this reason, do not allow leaves, grasses, 
brush, or any debris to collect or accumulate around the 
explosives storage area. 
7. Do not discharge weapons near an explosive maga- 
zine. Do not shoot into the storage dump. Keep the shoot- 
ing away from the explosives. 
8. Certain types of explosives require certain types of 
storage, including temperature regulation and other con- 
trols. Be sure that you understand all aspects of the com- 
pound’s nature before handling or storing it. 
9. At all times use common sense, and allow only quali- 
fied persons to be near or handle explosives. 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
123 
Safely precautions for handling explosives: 
1 . When transporting explosives, know what the federal 
and state laws and regulations are. Many of these regulations 
are just common-sense protection for yourself. 
2. Make sure that any vehicle used to transport explosives 
is in proper working order and equipped with a tight wood- 
en or nonsparking metal floor, with sides and ends high 
enough to prevent the explosives from falling off. The load in 
an open-bodied truck should be covered with a waterproof 
and fire-resistant tarpaulin. Wiring should be fully insulated 
so as to prevent short circuiting, and at least two fire exting- 
uishers should be carried. The truck should be plainly 
marked, if possible. 
3. In no circumstances allow metals of any sort, except 
the nonsparking type, to come into contact with the ex- 
plosive casing. Metal, flammable, or corrosive substances 
should not be transported with explosives. 
4. Never in any circumstances allow smoking around any 
explosive, regardless of its stability. 
5. Do not allow unauthorized persons to go near the ex- 
plosives. This is for two reasons; first, because they might 
not know what they are doing and accidentally set off an 
explosion, and secondly, because they might be undercover 
agents from the enemy. 
6. When loading or unloading explosives, do it with the 
utmost care. Whenever dealing with explosives, in any capa- 
city, do not rush. Take your time and exercise extreme 
caution. 
7. If you must transport both high explosives and blast- 
ing caps in the same vehicle, be sure that they are com- 
pletely separate from one another. 
Safety precautions when using explosives: 
1. When opening a case of explosives, in no circum- 
stances use a metal crowbar or wedge. Use a wooden 
wedge or nonmetallic tool. 
2. Do not smoke or allow anyone to smoke. Do not carry 
an open flame, or any other form of heat source or fire 
near an area where explosives are being used. 
3. Do not place explosives where they may be exposed 
to a flame, excessive heat, sparks, or shock. 
4. Replace the cover or close the top of the explosives 
container after use. 
5. Do not carry explosives in your pocket or on your 
person at any time. Even when on a mission of sabotage, 
it is better to carry explosives in a separate container. 
6. When making up primers or crimping blasting caps, 
do not do it near any other explosives, high or low. 
7. Blasting caps, although they may look like firecrack- 
ers, are a powerful explosive charge and must be treated 
accordingly. 
8. Never insert anything but a fuse into a blasting cap. 
Since blasting caps, to be functional, must be sensitive, a 
great degree of care must be used in handling them. 
9. Never experiment with, disassemble, strike, tamper 
with, or in any way try to remove the contents of a blast- 
ing cap. Do not try to pull the wires out of an electrical 
blasting cap. 
10. When handling explosives, the only persons who 
should be present are those who are absolutely necessary. 
All unnecessary and unauthorized persons should be 
cleared from the area. This, of course, includes animals 
and children. 
1 1 . Do not handle explosives, or stay in an area where 
explosives are being stored, when an electrical storm is ap- 
proaching. Clear the area and retire to safety. 
12. Inspect all equipment before use, and never use any 
equipment that appears damaged or deteriorated. 
13. Never attempt to reclaim any explosive or blasting 
material that has been water-soaked. 
Safety precautions to be taken when drilling: 
1. Check what you are about to drill into, to be sure 
there is not a charge already there. Never drill into an ex- 
plosive charge. 
2. Never stack surplus explosives near the drilling area. 
3. Since the act of drilling is based on the principles of 
friction, heat will be created. Never load a bore hole with- 
out first checking the temperature. Also check to see if 
any pieces of burning material are present. Temperatures 
above 150 degrees F. are extremely dangerous. 
Figure 71. Opening explosives. 
124 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
4. A common practice in demolitions is what is called 
springing a bore hole. This is when a small explosive 
is used to enlarge a bore hole, so that a much larger explosive 
charge can be placed in it. This should require extreme 
caution. Check to see if there are any other charges nearby. 
• 5. Never force explosives into a bore hole. Recheck your 
hole and dear the obstruction before attempting to reload. 
6. Never force a blasting cap or electrical blasting cap 
into a stick of dynamite. Use the hole made by the punch. 
7. Do not tamper in any manner with the primer. 
8. Figure out what quantity of explosives you will need, 
according to the formulas given later in the chapter, and 
then put in that amount. Do not use more than necessary. 
Safety precautions to be taken when tamping: 
(Tamping is the process of placing materials, such as 
sandbags, around the explosives so as to send the force of 
the explosion in one certain direction.) 
1. Tamping is a gentle process and should never be 
performed violently. 
2. When using tamping tools, be sure that these are 
made of wood or some other nonmetal sparkfree material. 
3. When tamping a bore hole that has recently been 
drilled, use clay, sand, dirt, or some other noncombustible 
material. 
4. Take extreme care not to damage or injure the fuse 
or electrical blasting cap wire when tamping. 
5. One should always tamp if possible, since it cuts down 
the amount of explosives necessary. 
Safety precautions to be taken when detonating electric- 
ally: 
1. Do not uncoil the wires of an electrical blasting cap, 
or employ their use, during a thunderstorm, dust storm, or 
when any other source of static electricity is present. 
2. Be very careful about the use of electrical blasting 
material near a radio frequency transmitter. Consult Radio 
Frequency Hazards, a pamphlet issued by the Institute of 
Makers of Explosives. 
3. Keep your firing circuit completely insulated from all 
conductors except the one circuit you intend to use. This 
means extreme care in insulation against the ground, bare 
wires, rails, pipes, or any paths of stray current. 
4. Keep all cables, wires, or other electrical equipment 
away from electrical blasting caps, except at the time of the 
blast, and for the purpose of that blast. 
5. Be very careful in the use of more than one blasting 
cap. Never use more than one type of blasting cap in a 
single operation. 
6. Use the correct current stated by the manufacturer to 
set off electrical blasting caps. Never use any less. 
7. Be sure that all the ends of the wires which are to be 
connected are bright and clean. 
8. Keep the electrical cap wires or lead wires short-cir- 
cuited until ready to fire. 
Safety precautions to be taken when using a fuse : 
1 . Handle the fuse carefully. Avoid damaging the cover- 
ing. In cold weather, warm the fuse slightly before using. 
Avoid cracking the waterproof outer coating. 
2. Never use a short fuse. Always use a fuse which is 
over two feet in length. Be absolutely sure you know the 
burning speed of the fuse, and have calculated the amount 
of time you will need to get to safety. 
3. When placing the fuse in the blasting cap, cut off an 
inch or so to insure dryness. Cut straight across the fuse 
with a clean new razor blade. Once the fuse is in place, do 
not twist, pull, or otherwise cause friction. 
4. Once the fuse is in place, it is necessary to crimp the 
fuse into the blasting cap. Crimping is the procedure of at- 
taching a nonelectrical blasting cap to a fuse, by bending 
the ends of the cap around the fuse. This must be done 
only with a special tool, called a crimper. Although crim- 
pers may look like pliers, they are not, and pliers must not 
be used. When crimping, be absolutely sure you know 
what you are doing, since, if you squeeze the explosive 
within the cap rather than the ends, there is a good chance 
you will blow your hand off. 
5. Do not light the fuse until you are sure that the 
sparks that come from it will not set off the explosive until 
the fuse has burned down. 
Safety precautions to be taken when firing explosives: 
1. Never hold an explosive in your hands, when lighting. 
2. Before exploding any charge, make sure a complete 
check of the area has been made, and sufficient time and 
warning have been given. 
3. Do not return to the area of the blast until all the 
smoke has cleared. 
4. Do not attempt to investigate a misfire too soon. Wait 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
125 
at least one hour, and be sure, if you are using an electrical 
circuit, that you have disconnected it. 
5. Never drill out misfires. 
6. Never abandon any explosives. 
7. Do not leave any explosive equipment, packing 
material, or empty cartridges where children or animals can 
get at them. 
Basic formulas for demolitions use 
1. Computation of minimum safety distance 
For charges less than 27 pounds, the minimum safety 
distance is 900 feet. Over 27 pounds, the minimum safety 
distances can be figured by using the following formula: 
300 x C pounds of explosive (T.N.T.) 
2. Steel cutting 
When cutting, with explosives, part of a steel structure, 
determine the area in square inches of the member to be 
cut. This area is then labeled “A,” and one can use the 
following formula : 
P= 3 / 8 A 
P— the number of pounds of T.N.T. necessary. 
3. Steel cutting 
When a steel member is not part of a greater structure, 
a different formula is used. This is based on the diameter 
of the individual member. 
P=D 2 
P = the amount of T.N.T. required, and D is the dia- 
meter of the piece of steel. 
4. Train rails 
To cut rails that weigh less than 80 pounds, use one- 
half pound of explosives. To cut rails that weigh over 80 
pounds, use a full pound of explosives. 
5. Timber cutting 
When the charge is to be external and untamped, the 
formula is as follows: 
C 3 
P= -- 
30 
P equals the pounds of explosives required, and C equals 
the circumference of the tree in feet (this formula is given 
for plastique) . When figuring an internal tamped charge, the 
formula is: 
250 
P equals the pounds of explosives, and D equals the 
diameter of the tree in inches. 
Some important principles 
A basic rule to follow in all calculations having to do 
with explosive compounds is to round off the amount to the 
next highest unit package. At times you may use a little 
more than necessary, but you will be assured of success. 
Another rule when calculating charges is to add one-third 
more explosives if you do not intend to tamp. If a formula 
is given for plastique (composition 4), as was done for 
both timber-cutting formulas, you are able to compute 
poundage in T.N.T. by adding one-third to the weight of 
the plastique. 
When using the principle of cratering to destroy a paved 
surface with explosives, use several charges rather than 
just one. The use of a bore hole is especially effective 
here. It is pointless to attempt cratering a roadway without 
tamping, since most of the destructive force of your 
charge will go straight up in the air. 
In the first two sections of this chapter, I have discussed 
explosives chemically and written about their safe handling. 
In the third section, I intend to go into their specific appli- 
cation. Bombs, like spies, have no allegiance, even to their 
creators. 
Bombs and booby traps incorporate more than just tech- 
nical knowledge, they are based on human nature. To 
create an effective booby trap, one must have a primitive 
insight into his enemy’s actions, thoughts, and methods. 
Before I get into the nitty-gritty of constructing booby 
traps, bombs, land mines, grenades, etc., it is important to 
explain the basic working principles and mechanisms be- 
hind these devices. 
In the acquisition of equipment I would recommend pur- 
chasing or stealing, rather than making your own. Manu- 
factured equipment is much safer to work with, and usually 
more effective. Once you have your explosive compound, 
you will need a way to set it off, or detonate it. With all 
high explosives, you will need a detonator or blasting cap, 
unless you decide to lace the fuse into the explosive, al- 
though this is not recomended. A blasting cap is a low- 
explosive compound that is connected to a high explosive, 
for the purpose of detonating it. There are two types of 
blasting caps — electric and nonelectric. 
To use a nonelectrical blasting cap, one gently pushes 
the fuse into the hollow end, until it is fully in. He then 
crimps the hollow metal end around the fuse, and puts it 
into the high explosive. When the fuse burns down, it ig- 
nites the flash charge. That in turn explodes the priming

charge, which detonates the base charge, and finally creates 
enough heat to set off the high-explosive charge. The fuse 
is ordinary safety fuse or detonating cord.

caps offer a much greater variety of uses, The basic prin- 
ciple of the electrical blasting cap is that an electrical 
charge moves through an insulated wire until it reaches a 
small section of that same wire which is not insulated and 
which is surrounded by a primary flash charge. The heat 
from the electrical charge will explode the flash charge, 
which in turn will set off a series of minor explosions, fin- 
ishing up with the high explosive. 
Both types of blasting caps should be placed within the 
high explosive itself. This is easy when working with 
plastique or a pliable substance. Manufactured T.N.T. has 
3 small hole designed at the top for just this reason, but in 
dynamite one has to make his own hole. This hole should 
be made with a wooden or nonsparking metal object. The 
ends of the crimpers, illustrated on the previous page, are 
ideal. The hole can be made in one of two ways: the first 
is bored carefully and gently straight down from the top 
of the stick, to exactly the length of the cap itself; the sec- 
ond type of hole is made from the side in a downward 
diagonal direction. Both of these methods have proven 
effective.

Method 1 
Method 2 
Figure 76. Priming dynamite electrically. 
Another method of priming dynamite, which is not as 
reliable as either nonelectrical or electrical blasting caps, is 
called “lacing.” The principle behind most detonating de- 
vices is simply to create a temperature which is hot enough 
to ignite the high explosive. This increase in temperature 
can be accomplished with a relatively good degree of suc- 
cess by weaving the fuse throughout the high explosive so 
that, as the fuse burns down, the heat created from the 
burning process is captured and held within the high ex- 
plosive until the detonation temperature is reached. 
There are different methods of lacing, depending on 
what type of high explosive you happen to be working with. 
For dynamite, the most common and most functional 
method is literally to sew the detonation cord into the stick. 
This preparation entails the individual’s making several 
holes directly through the dynamite itself. This hole-mak- 
ing should be performed just as the planting of the blasting 
cap was handled. The holes must be dug gently and slowly 
with a nonmetallic instrument. “Lacing” should be done 
only when there is no alternative, and blasting caps are not 
available. 
Figure 77. Lacing dynamite. 
When using TNT, you can lace it by wrapping the 
detonating cord around the body of the explosive at least 
five or six times, and then tying it off with a clove hitch. 
This will result in a great amount of heat being transferred 
into the TNT from the fuse, and its detonation. 
Plastique can also be ignited in this fashion, by employ- 
ing a heavy-duty detonation cord, and tying a double knot 
in one of its ends. This large knot is then buried deep in the 
center of the composition. It must be at least one inch from 
any side.

/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
Tamping 
Tamping is nothing more than an operation performed 
before the explosion, to regulate and direct the destructive 
power of the explosion. In other words, if a pound of black 
powder is ignited with a match, the explosion will occur 
but most of the destructive force will take the path of least 
resistance — into the atmosphere. Now, if the same pound 
of black powder was placed within a steel pipe, and sealed 
at both ends, except for a tiny hole for the fuse, the ex- 
plosion could be regulated with ease. This tamping opera- 
tion is necessary for any forms of demolitions in order that 
the operation be successful. A stick of dynamite placed on 
a concrete roadway untamped, when exploded will create 
a very small crater, perhaps a few inches. If this same stick 
of dynamite were tamped, by placing several sandbags on 
top of it and around it, the explosion would create a much 
greater crater. This tamping operation is absolutely neces- 
sary for the demolition of a large structure or building. 
1. When attempting to sever a steel rod or pole, through 
the use of explosives, place a charge on each side, leaving 
a small gap between the butts of the explosives. 
2. When cutting a chain, place the explosive charge on 
one side and tape it securely into place. 
3. When cutting any odd-shaped object, the best ex- 
plosive to use is plastique, because of its flexibility. It is 
especially useful and effective when cutting heavy metal 
cables. The compound should be placed around the side 
of the cable that is to be cut, about a half-inch thick. 
When sabotaging railroad tracks with explosive, use 
plastique if available, since this is the easiest substance to 
use when trying to sever objects of irregular shapes. The 
most common way of cutting train tracks is by placing a 
charge of high explosives on either side of the “1” beam 
track, so as to have the forces of the two explosions act 
upon each other, thus causing the middle object maximum 
destruction. 
Another method which has proven equally effective is 
placing a charge between the rail and the switch. The 
switch is one of the weakest points along the line, and a 
relatively small charge will not only sever the switch and 
rail, but will also rip up the ties and the railroad bed. 
Tamping with sandbags can and should be used if at all 
possible, since the extent of the damage is multiplied sev- 
eral times by the addition of the sandbags. Tamping can be 
useless if you are on a silent lightning-fast mission. In this 
case, a two-pound charge of TNT carefully placed between 
the switch and rail will almost certainly do the trick without 
tamping. The best procedure when engaged in this type of 
sabotage is to repeat the acts every three-quarters of a mile 
or so, so as to delay the repairmen and create confusion. 
Placement of charges 
In demolition work, the greatest problem is the actual 
placement of the charges. When an individual is working 
on a large structure such as a building or a bridge, it is 
imperative that he have an understanding of the directional 
force of explosives, and the structure’s weaknesses. These 
large-type structures are built to bear up under abnormal 
stress, so the chances are good, unless the charges are 
placed correctly, that the sabotage will have little or no 
effect. 
When attempting the demolition of a building, the first 
130 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
thing to do is to determine the weakest point in the struc- 
ture. This is the point where a charge can be placed and 
well-tamped, and will result in maximum destruction. A 
large building will usually take more than just one charge. 
The best bet is to place large explosive charges on either 
side of a weak point in the foundations. These charges 
should be tamped from the outside, so as to drive the force 
inward. 
There are several basic methods of planting explosives. 
The advantage to most of the ones listed below is that they 
have a natural tamping factor, built-in. 
1. Bury the explosive beneath the object of destruction. 
2. Drill a bore hole into the object and fill with ex- 
plosives. 
3. Form a brace to hold the explosives tight against the 
object of destruction. A good brace can be made from 
wood placed on a diagonal, with one end jammed into the 
ground. 
4. Place a charge out in the open, with the tamping 
material surrounding it, and directing its force. 
Bridge destruction 
Bridges are much harder to destroy than buildings, and 
this is for several reasons: 
1. Most of the bridges to be destroyed will be far larger 
than the buildings. 
2. They are built strongly, to last for long periods of 
time. 
3. They have many reinforcements that are not visible. 
4. Everyone realizes the strategic importance of bridges, 
therefore everyone should realize how well guarded they 
are. 
An important factor to bear in mind, when working on 
bridge demolition, is the extent of real damage desired. 
Total destruction of a bridge is useless, a waste of good 
explosives. It may even be harmful, since there may come 
a time when a friendly force will need the use of that 
bridge. Bridge destruction should therefore be considered a 
tactical-delay operation. It will slow the enemy down, and 
cause them much expense and time to rebuild. Since types 
of charges differ for different types of bridges, I will go into 
specific types of bridge demolitions. 
Stringer bridges are the most common type of concrete, 
steel, or timber bridges in existence. They are usually one 
or more spans, but this makes little difference in the actual 
placement of charges. If more than one span is to be de- 
stroyed, one should just copy the first placement on the 
second span. The stringer-type bridge is on basically two 
or three steel “I” beams, referred to as stringers. The ob- 
vious method is to attempt to sever these primary aspects 
of the entire structure. This can be accomplished by placing 
charges on either side of each stringer. Each charge should 
be tamped either with sandbags or a wooden brace. The 
result of placing all the charges on the same side of the 
stringer is the twisting and forced warping of the steel 
beams beyond any future use. When dealing with a bridge 
of this type which incorporates more than one span, 
place the charges along the joints of the stringer, since this 
is the weakest point along the line. 
A slab bridge is a simple structure, consisting of a flat 
slab of either concrete or timber held together in such a 
way that it forms one continuous slab. These are the easi- 
est bridges to destroy, since all that is required is a diag- 
onal line of explosive charges placed either under, or dril- 
led into, the structure itself. If the charges are placed be- 
Figure 84. Slab bridge. 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
131 
neath the bridge, they should be attached by some means, 
and tamping should be used. 
The T-beam bridge is very similar to the stringer-type 
bridge, except it is without the bottom reinforcements. This 
doesn’t mean that the T-beam type is any weaker or easier 
to destroy. This type of bridge is based on three or four 
concrete or steel T-beams, with a large slab of concrete 
covering them. The space between the T-beams on the 
underneath of the bridge is ideal for the placement of ex- 
plosive charges, since 75 percent of the tamping has al- 
ready been constructed, by the very nature of the bridge 
itself. This type of bridge may have more than one span 
but, since bridge destruction is only a tactical-delay opera- 
tion, the destruction of one span should be enough. If you 
wish to destroy more than one span, just repeat the same 
operation, on the second span, paying close attention to the 
joints. Like the stringer-type bridge, the charges are placed 
beneath the bridge, between the beams themselves. A steel 
or wooden platform should be constructed to so hold the 
explosives, and direct their force upward into the bridge. 
Figure 85. T-beam bridge. 
The concrete cantilever bridge is probably better known placed along the joints of the separate sections or spans, 
as a causeway. It is usually a very low bridge, with many Place charges of explosives at the foot of the correspond- 
segments or spans supported by a series of concrete col- ing column to insure destruction. The charges placed at the 
umns. The same basic procedure should be followed as pre- foot of the columns should all be tamped and placed on 
viously outlined, in that one should look for the weakest the same side of the respective columns, so as to encour- 
point in the entire structure, and fix the charges at that age maximum destruction. This type of bridge has many 
point. The weakest point in most structures is the place spans, but usually it is only necessary to destroy several of 
where two objects join, so the explosive charges should be the middle sections, as shown below. 
The “X”s mark the location of the explosive charges. All 
charges placed at the foot of the columns should be situated 
on the same side, so as to channel the movement of the 
destructive force in one direction. 
The truss bridge is usually used for railroad crossings, 
and is built of steel. This type of bridge is one of the 
strongest in the world, and offers many problems for the 
saboteur. The best method is to run several different ex- 
plosions at thirty-minute intervals, so that one can see ex- 
actly what needs destruction, but this is not feasible for the 
guerrilla operation. Figure 87 is a diagram of this type of 
bridge. The “X”s show the location of five charges, which 
can be placed hastily and are reasonably effective. Be very 
careful when attempting a sabotage operation of this type. 
132 
/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
especially with a truss bridge, since, as it is a train crossing, 
it will undoubtedly be guarded heavily. 
Figure 87. Truss bridge. 
Suspension bridges are, generally speaking, the largest 
bridges in the world, and accordingly the strongest. It is a 
good idea to allow yourself three or four separate charges 
with a time lapse between them. If this not possible, con- 
centrate your charges on the main cables, and the center 
section of the bridge. Six — no less important — charges 
should be placed on the two towers at either end of the 
bridge and tamped down. “X”s mark the location of the 
explosive charges in Figure 88. 
Detonators 
The most common time-delay device is an ordinary 
safety fuse. These fuses usually consist of a black-powder 
core surrounded with a fabric and then a layer of water- 
proof material. Although there are many different types, it 
can generally be said that safety fuses burn between 30 
and 45 seconds per foot; however, check these figures 
when you make your purchase. Fuses can be bought from 
any mail-order pyrotechnics company. Two with whom I 
have dealt are: 
Ecco Products 
Box 189 
Northvale, New Jersey 07647 
Westech Corporation 
P.O. Box 8193 
Salt Lake City, Utah 84108 
Double-coated waterproof fuse usually sells for 20 to 25 
dollars for a thousand to fifteen hundred feet. I would ad- 
vise purchasing this equipment, since homemade fuses are 
not to be trusted. 
Bombs can be detonated in many ways. The detonation 
and use of certain devices are based mainly on the clever- 
ness and imagination of the saboteur. In the following sec- 
tion I have discussed several basic forms of detonators, 
both nonelectric and electric. However, there is an infinite 
number of variations, which may be better suited to indi- 
vidual situations. 
The first type is referred to either as a tension-release, 
or a wiretrip device. It operates on the principle of releas- 
ing the tension caused by a wound spring, on the firing 
pin, and allowing it to strike and set off a nonelectrical 
blasting cap. The nonelectrical blasting cap will in turn gen- 
erate the necessary heat to ignite the T.N.T. or dynamite. 
This can be implemented in many ways. Two simple meth- 
ods are illustrated in Figures 89 and 90. A common method 
in which the wire-trip device can be employed is stretching 
a trip wire about six inches above the ground. Another 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
133 
equally popular method of employing the tension-release 
device is attaching the taut wire to the back of a door, so 
that, when the door is opened, the tension is released, and 
the explosive ignites. 
A device very similar to the last one is the pull-trigger 
electric detonator. It functions in the same manner, in that 
a safety pin is removed from the striker or firing pin, caus- 
ing it to move forward and connect with a metal plate. 
This connection with the metal plate completes the elec- 
trical circuit. The batteries have been connected by wires 
to an electrical blasting cap, a metal plate, and finally to 
the firing pin. (See Figure 91.) Although professional sup- 
plies for this equipment are available at reasonable prices, 
the diagram shows the detonating device constructed from 
household items. The construction of this device is as fol- 
lows: Two flashlight batteries are connected to each otheT, 
and then one wire is run from one end of the batteries to 
the electrical blasting cap, the other wire from the opposite 
end of the batteries to the metal plate. A third wire is run 
from the blasting cap to the firing pin. This now completes 
the fully cocked device. 
Figure 89. Tension-release detonator. 
134 
/ 
THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
In the same manner as the explosive in Figure 89 is 
detonated, so is the common military grenade. The prin- 
ciple of a tension release is the same. After the pin is pulled 
out of the military grenade, the spring is free to react, caus- 
ing the primer to ignite the lead-spitter fuse, and it in turn 
will ignite the lead oxide and pentolite. The pentolite will 
release enough heat to ignite the T.N.T. and cause the frag- 
mentation of the metal casing. 
The next type of detonating device I am going to discuss 
is called the pressure-trigger device. It is based on the ap- 
plication of pressure rather than its release, as in the pre- 
vious devices. This mechanism is primarily used when an 
electrical circuit is employed. The plunger is pushed down; 
it forces one thin metal plate against another thicker metal 
plate. The batteries are connected, via the blasting cap, to 
each of these metal plates. Therefore, when they touch, 
the electrical circuit is complete, and the explosive will 
ignite. 
This type of device has several important advantages. 
First of all, it can be constructed away from the area it will 
be used in. This will cut installation time down to seconds. 
Later in the chapter, I discuss a type of booby trap that can 
be rigged into the ignition system of a car. Although the ig- 
nition-system booby trap works very well, it takes time 
to install. This pressure-trigger device will act almost in the 
same manner if placed beneath the driver’s seat, and can 
be installed in a lot less time. (See Figures 92 and 93.)

Figure 92. Pressure-trigger device under driver’s seat. 
Release of pressure detonators 
The next type of detonating device I will discuss is called 
a release-of-pressure mechanism. This device employs ex- 
actly the same principles as the pressure-trigger device, ex- 
cept in reverse. The movement of the pressure plate, rather 
than down, is now up. This can be used effectively when a 
weight is placed on the pressure plate. Then when it is re- 
moved, the explosives will be ignited. To construct, use a 
heavy-duty spring beneath the first metal plate, as shown in 
Figure 93. Connect a wire from the blasting cap to the first 
metal plate. The second wire is then stretched from the bot- 
tom of battery “A,” to the second metal plate. The third wire 
is run from the electrical blasting cap to the top of battery 
“B.” When this is accomplished, the booby trap is fully 
cocked. When the weight on the pressure plate is removed, 
the spring will force the second metal plate against the first 
metal plate, thus completing the electrical circuit and ex- 
ploding the device. 
Figure 95 shows a booby trap which incorporates a ten- 
sion-release device. When the tension, resulting from a 
wire pulling on a pliable metal strip, is released, the' metal 
strip (will snap back into another metal strip. Since the 
wires from the batteries and blasting cap are connected to 
either metal strip, when they touch, the circuit will be com- 
plete and it will detonate the explosive charge. This type 
of detonator is especially effective when attached to draw- 
ers, doors, or any movable objects. 
Time delay devices 
There are three different types of time-delay devices; 
1 . Metal strip under tension until it breaks. 
2. Chemical action that will, after a period of time, pro- 
duce enough heat to detonate the explosive charge. 
3. An alarm clock set for a certain time, so that when it 
rings it will complete an electrical circuit, thus detonating 
an electrical blasting cap. The first method, metal under 
tension until breakage, I will not discuss, since it is ex- 
tremely hazardous and unreliable. You can have little or no 
control over timing, and such devices are notorious for 
backfiring. 
The chemical-action time-delay methods have proven 
to be pretty reliable. Most of this action incorporates the 
amount of time taken by a certain solution of acid to eat 
its way through another substance. The time length can be 
determined by the concentration of the acid and by the sub- 
stance to be eaten through. 
An example of this type of chemical action is the Nipple 
Time Bomb, which is very effective. One must obtain a 
short section of steel pipe and cap each end accordingly. 
Place inside the steel pipe a stick of dynamite, and drill a 
quarter-inch hole at one end of the cap. Now, into this hole 
you must place a small amount of potassium chlorate and 
gunpowder. Now, separately from the pipe, take a small 
glass vial and fill it with a concentrated sulfuric acid solu- 
tion, then stop up the end with a paper or cork stopper. To 
arm the bomb, place the vial of acid upside down in the 
hole at the top of the pipe. Now, when the acid has eaten 
its way through the stopper, it will come into contact with 
the potassium chlorate and gunpowder. The mixture of 
these chemicals will cause a minor explosion, but it will be 
large enough to produce the heat necessary to detonate the 
dynamite. The detonation time is usually between three 
and six hours. If a solution of sulfuric acid and glycerin is 
used, rather than just pure sulfuric acid, the time delay will 
be up to five or six days. (See Figure 96.) 
Figure 97 is a diagram of an incendiary time bomb. This 
is very similar to the Nipple Time Bomb, in that it relies 
on the same chemical action, but without the dynamite. 
The procedure is very simple. A cardboard or iron tube is 
filled with a mixture of three-quarters potassium chlorate 
and one-quarter sugar, and then sealed. At one end a hole 
is made. Into that hole is placed an inverted vial of sulfuric 
acid, with a paper or cork stopper. When the acid has 
eaten its way through the stopper, it will come into con- 
tact with the potassium chlorate-sugar mixture. This will 
result in a very hot, powerful fire.

/ THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
is effective, but it has many disadvantages. The procedure 
is very simple. Take a tin can and fill three-quarters of it 
with highly compressed gunpowder. Now attach to the top 
of the can a small magnifying glass, so that the sun’s light, 
when magnified through the glass, will cause the heat 
necessary to detonate the charge. This works very well, as 
long as the sun shines, and it doesn’t rain. 
The alarm-clock detonating method is the most accurate 
device, in that a person can set the time he wishes the bomb 
to explode. It is connected in the same fashion as the other 
electrical-circuit booby traps. Wires are connected to the 
hammer of the bell and to the bell itself, via the blasting 
cap, to a dry cell (as shown in Figure 99). The clock 
should be set before the booby trap is built. When the 
alarm goes off, the hammer and bell connect completing 
the electrical circuit and detonating the explosive. 
Up to now I have been primarily concerned with deton- 
ating devices, rather than the actual application of these 
bombs and booby traps. In this last section on explosives, 
I will deal with just a few of the many applications for 
these booby traps. Each situation calls for different tech- 
niques, so use your imagination and your cunning. 
Road trap 
The first type of application I will discuss is a basic road 
trap. This incorporates a wire-trip action to complete the 
electrical circuit. It is extremely simple to make, since all 
the equipment can be gathered in or around the house. 
The great advantage to this particular device is that the ex- 
plosives are detonated, when the vehicle is directly over it, 
so insuring maximum destruction. (See Figure 100.) To 
construct a road trap, begin by digging three holes across a 
roadway. Into two of the holes place the explosive charges, 
and into the third place a regular car battery. Connect the 
first wire from the negative terminal of the battery via each 
of the blasting caps, in each charge, to a metal pin on 
one side of an ordinary clothespin. The second wire should 
be connected directly from the positive terminal of the bat- 
tery to the opposite metal pin, located on the same clothes- 
pin. The clothespin must be kept open by a small wooden 
wedge, which is attached to a thin black wire stretched 
across the roadway. When the semi-invisible wire is pulled, 
the wooden wedge will fall out of the clothespin, thus clos- 
ing the clothespin. When the clothespin is closed, the two 
metal pins will connect and complete the electrical circuit, 
thus exploding the charges. 
Walk trap 
In Figure 101 is illustrated what is known as a walk trap. 
This incorporates the same type of wire-trip action as de- 
scribed in the road trap. The walk trap is not electrically 
operated, it relies on a percussion detonator. When the wire 
is pulled, it pulls the safety pin out of the heavy firing pin. 
The heat created from the detonator’s explosion will be 
sufficient to set off the TNT. This type of booby trap is 
especially effective in dense undergrowth, where the trip 
wire cannot be readily seen. 
Bangalore torpedo 
In Figure 102, the Bangalore torpedo is illustrated. This 
is nothing more than a few sections of pipe filled with sticks 
of dynamite, sealed at the ends, and joined in the middle by 
couplings, thus permitting the torpedo to be of varying 
lengths. The cap at one end must have a small hole drilled 
in it, so that a fuse and blasting cap can be inserted. It can 
be used very effectively to destroy walls, barricades, and 
steel or iron doors. These are also great weapons against 
cars, trucks, and even trains. If piping of this sort is not 
available, you can make a substitute torpedo by taking a 
stick of dynamite and wrapping it tightly with electric tape 
and thin copper wire. To be effective, it should have many 
layers of each. 
Molotov cocktail 
Figure 103 shows a Molotov Cocktail. This is an incen- 
diary bomb, which bursts into flame on breaking. A quart 
bottle is filled with two-thirds gasoline and one-third oil. A 
fuse is made of an old gasoline-soaked rag, and then stuffed 
into the mouth of the bottle. The bottle is corked, and the 
fuse is lit. It is thrown and, when it breaks, it wilFbiirst into 
flame. The enemy will not be able to extinguish the fire 
with water. These were used with varying degrees of suc- 
cess in the struggle in Hungary. According to reports they 
can disable a tank. 
Homemade hand grenade 
A homemade grenade is shown in Figure 104. This is 
constructed from an empty, clean, condensed-milk can, at- 
tached to a wooden handle. It is then filled halfway with 
a layer of dynamite. In the dynamite is placed a nonelectric 
blasting cap, with a five- to six-second fuse. The dynamite 
is then covered with small pieces of iron, until the can is 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
149 
full. Seal the top of the open end closed, leaving a small 
hole for the fuse. 
How to make an anti-personnel grenade 
Even more effective than the grenade described above 
is an anti-personnel grenade. This is constructed by taking 
a piece of pipe and closing it at one end, either by soldering 
or by screwing a cap on it. The pipe is packed tightly with 
dynamite, and sealed at the other end, leaving a small hole 
for the detonator, which is made in the following manner. 
A piece of one-eighth-inch tubing is fastened to the end of a 
piece of fuse, which in turn is attached to a detonating cap. 
On the other end of the fuse, a bit of cotton, saturated with 
chlorate of potassium and common sugar, is placed, fol- 
lowed by another piece of cotton and a little vial of sulfuric 
acid. (This vial must be hermetically sealed, to prevent 
leakage.) Finally, a piece of wood or iron, which can be 
easily moved, is packed in the remaining empty space. The 
piece of wood is placed there, so that when the pipe is 
moved the piece of iron or wood will fall against the vial of 
sulfuric acid and break it. Once the sulfuric acid contacts 
the potassium chlorate, the chemical reaction will cause a 
very hot flame, which will ignite the fuse and cause the 
explosion. If this type of device is placed in a roadway, or 
directly in the path of the enemy army, there is a good 
chance it will be set off — either by a kick or by curiosity. 
Book trap 
Figure 105 depicts a book trap. To construct this, you 
will need a large book, perhaps a thousand pages. The 
book should be hollowed out, leaving the edges intact. In 
this hollow place, put a dry cell battery and your explosive, 
and connect the wires. Fix two metal contact points to the 
edges of the book, and separate them with a wooden 
wedge, which is attached to the rear wall of the bookcase. 
This must be accomplished in such a manner that, when 
the book is removed from the shelf, the metal contact 
points will touch and complete the electrical circuit, thus 
causing the detonation of the explosive charge. 
Door-handle traps 
Two basic methods of booby-trapping door handles are 
illustrated in Figure 106. The first employs a short test 
tube, a cork, two needles, three wires, one electric blasting 
cap, one metal ball bearing, and one stick of dynamite. The 
two needles are pushed through the cork to an equal length, 
and the ball bearing is placed within the tube. The test 
tube is corked, and taped to the inside of a door handle. 
The wires are then connected from the eyes of the two 
needles to the battery, with one wire going via the blasting 
cap. Next, the battery and stick of dynamite are taped to 
the back of the door. When the handle is turned, the ball 
bearing will roll and touch both points of the needles, thus 
completing the electrical circuit and exploding the dyna- 
mite. 
The second door-handle trap is much the same, except 
it uses a mercury thermostat switch, rather than a ball 
bearing. 
Loose floorboard trap 
The loose floorboard trap (Figure 107) utilizes the same 
principles as the Book Trap, in that it relies on two metal 
contact points touching to complete the electrical circuit. 
Beneath the loose floorboard are two strips of pliable metal 
or bamboo, each with a metal contact point, which will 
touch when pressure is brought down on the loose floor- 
board. 
Gate trap 
Illustrated in Figure 108 is the utilization of a regulation 
military grenade in a booby trap. This is an extremely 
simple, effective, and relatively safe booby trap. To cock 
the booby trap, pull the pin on a regular tension release 
grenade, and place beneath a swinging gate, or anywhere 
that will supply the pressure necessary. When the gate is 
moved (either opened or closed), the pressure will be re- 
leased and the grenade detonated. 
Chimney trap 
An extremely simple but effective booby trap can be 
placed in a fireplace in a matter of seconds. Take three or 
four sticks of dynamite and tape them together. Attach a 
nonelectrical blasting cap, with a three- or four-foot fuse. 
Now tape the dynamite about five feet up on the inside of 
the chimney, leaving the fuse hanging loose downward. 
The end of the fuse should be about a foot or so up the 
chimney so that it is out of sight. When a fire is lit, the heat 
generated will ignite the fuse, and it will explode the 
charge, further up the chimney. This works extremely well, 
since most of the tamping is supplied by the very structure 
of the chimney. 
150 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
Lamp trap 
A personnel booby trap can be made by taking any oil 
or kerosene lamp and draining it of all the fuel. Now re- 
place the oil with high-octane gasoline. When lit, this will 
cause a massive incendiary explosion. A candle can also 
be booby-trapped, by stuffing a small amount of lead 
azide or tetryl pellets into the wax, near the wick. The ex- 
plosives will detonate from the flame of the candle. 
Car trap 
It is an extremely simple procedure to booby-trap a 
car. It has many advantages, the most important being that 
you do not have to carry your own power supply, but 
rather use the ignition system of the car itself. Wires are 
run from the electrical blasting cap to points along the elec- 
trical ignition system, and attached with alligator clips. 
When the key is turned, it will complete the ignition sys- 
tem, and thus explode the bomb. A good place to hide ex- 
plosives is in the hollow cavity behind the dashboard, since 
then the full force of the explosion will be directed at the 
individuals in the front seat. 
Pipe trap 
There are basically two methods of booby-trapping 
pipes. The first is very similar to the chimney trap, except 
the intent is to blow off the smoker’s head. A small amount 
of tetryl or lead azide is placed in the mouthpiece of the 
pipe, and a fuse is attached, which leads through the rest of 
the pipe to a point about one-quarter-inch beneath the 
bowl (Figure 109). When the smoker lights the pipe, the 
fuse will be lit, and burn down untouched, until it deton- 
ates the explosives in the mouthpiece, and blows the 
smoker’s head off. 
The second method (illustrated in Figure 109) is a little 
more complex but just as effective. A very sensitive ex- 
plosive is placed in the mouthpiece, as before, except an 
activated firing pin is placed in the stem of the pipe. The 
smoker will attempt to light the pipe and find he cannot 
suck through it. Believing the stem to be blocked with tar 
or nicotine, he will unscrew the threaded joint. The act of 
unscrewing will release the firing pin, and detonate the ex- 
plosives. 
Pen trap 
An ordinary plastic or metal retractable ball-point pen 
can be turned into a lethal weapon in a matter of minutes. 
The refill ink cartridge is removed, and in its place is put 
a small amount of tetryl. Above the charge is placed a 
firing pin, similar to the one used in the second method of 
the pipe trap. This firing pin will be held under pressure 
created by the pen’s own spring. The tension is released by 
reversing the firing-pin motion. When the user snaps the 
plunger at the end of the pen, the firing pin is released and 
goes crashing in the tetryl, and detonates it. (See Figure 
110 .) 
Whistle trap and other handy devices 
A booby trap that has an effect similar to the one 
created by the pipe trap, is the whistle booby trap. It is 
constructed by separating the metal or plastic sides into 
their natural halves. This can be accomplished by steam- 
ing. Now, fill each half one-fourth full of an extreme- 
ly friction-sensitive explosive. Before gluing the two halves 
together, include a small ball made of a rough sandpaper- 
like substance. When the whistle is blown, the ball will 
bounce around inside the shell, creating enough friction 
heat to set off the explosive charge. 
An interesting booby trap can be constructed by using 
a bottle, full of a highly sensitive liquid explosive, which 
will detonate on the extraction of the cork. The cork is de- 
signed with a friction element that pulls through a sensitive 
explosive. When this booby trap explodes, it does extensive 
damage, due to the fragmentation of the glass. 
An extremely simple device for setting a time-delay fire 
is a book of matches, with a lighted cigarette stuck in it. 
This is then left upon combustible material. The cigarette, 
as it burns down, will light the matches, and they in turn 
will generate the heat necessary to ignite the other larger 
combustible material. 
Another incendiary time-delay device is constructed out 
of a candle, friction matches, and several rags soaked either 
in gasoline or kerosene. The candle is placed upright in the 
center of the bundle of matches. The soaked rags are 
placed around the base of the matches. As the candle burns 
down, it will ignite the matches, and they will ignite the 
rags. One can usually expect about a fifteen-minute delay 
with this device. 
Cacodyal 
To conclude this chapter, I will present the most horren- 
dous recipe I could find. Since it is not feasible to make 
napalm in your kitchen, you will have to be satisfied with 
cacodyal. This is made by chemically extracting all the oxy- 
EXPLOSIVES AND BOOBY TRAPS / 
151 
gen from alcohol, and then replacing it, under laboratory 
controls, with metal arsenic. The formula for alcohol is CL 
H.-, O, whereas for cacodyal it is C 4 H n AR. Now, this new 
substance, cacodyal, possesses spontaneous inflammability, 
the moment it is exposed to the air. Therefore it can be 
put into a bottle and used like a Molotov Cocktail. If it is 
thrown, it will explode on impact, but this is not its real 
advantage. When it explodes, a dense white smoke is given 
off. This is white arsenic, a deadly poison. One inhalation 
will probably cause death in a matter of seconds. 
Postscript 
This is the section I had hoped would not be necessary. 
When I began the book, 1 said to myself that there was a 
relatively good chance that we .might have more degrees of 
real freedom by the time the book was finished. Well, 
finished it is, and Vietnam is still there, Cambodia has been 
added, the corporations are still polluting, and the govern- 
ment is still lying. Since we can still legally call ourselves 
oppressed people, I find this last section on legal crap 
necessary. 
It is amazing with so many so-called “intelligent” people 
running about that we still have a state, a government, a 
bunch of archaic laws, and a multitude of psychotics will- 
ing to enforce them. If people depend on the state to make 
laws, to prevent themselves from doing what they really 
want to do, then I say that these people are nuts. I mean 
to say, if I really want to do something, I don’t particularly 
care if it’s legal, illegal, moral, immoral, or amoral. I want 
to do it, so I do it. The only laws a man can truly respect 
are the ones he makes for himself. 
Have you noticed that the people who actually make the 
laws, the people in power, never make laws for themselves? 
They pass legislation for the other people, who don’t want 
the laws to begin with. This government is a vicious 
bureaucratic cycle, with the people in power denying they 
have the power, passing legislation to protect their power, 
and conveniently losing any legislation which does not con- 
form to their own particular brand of megalomania, in one 
of their many advisory committees. 
I do not want laws that protect me from myself. Does it 
sound absurd? If I wish to ride a motorcycle without a 
helmet, it is my absolute right to do so. If I wish to be a 
fool, it is my right, since the only person who could be hurt 
by my action is me. If I want to sleep with men, or take 
LSD, or march naked across Sheep Meadow, or do per- 
verse things to my dog, then by what right does the govern- 
ment stop me? 
Robert Heinlein, in a recent book The Moon Is a Harsh 
Mistress, talks about an idea for taxation which I think 
could be extremely functional. It is that the people in 
power — the senators, congressmen, presidents, et al — 
should pay all the taxes themselves. Since these officials 
are making laws nobody wants anyway, why shouldn’t the 
people keep the government as financially weak as pos- 
sible? 
Since the revolution hasn’t taken place yet, I have in- 
cluded here some basic common-sense legal advice. 
I was busted about two years ago at a demonstration. 
The charges were trumped up and finally dropped, but the 
affair cost me five hundred bucks in legal expenses. That 
five hundred I couldn’t afford. I had to borrow it from 
friends but, whatever it cost, it was worth it. It showed 
exactly where the legal system of this country was at. 
Ninety percent of the guys in jail with me were black, and 
Spanish, because they couldn’t dig up the outrageous bails. 
I sincerely hope that, if and when they ever get out, they 
will still be able to see the injustice with the same clarity 
and passionate hatred. 
Prison does strange things to men. Although its purpose 
is to break the free spirit of a man, in many cases it just 
adds fuel to the fire that has never been and never will be 
extinguished. 
The wheel of the law turns 
without pause. 
After rain, good weather. 
In the wink of an eye. 
The universe throws off 
its muddy clothes.

Written in prison 
The cop is a phenomenon, unto himself. He is a para- 
noiac. He is a megalomaniac. He can be a sadist. He can 
be vicious and cruel. He can be nice and sweet, especially 
if he wants something. He can break the laws that he pre- 
tends to be enforcing, with impunity. He is very sensitive 
to being called names, and tends to react the only way 
he knows how. He is armed to the teeth, with clubs, chem- 
icals, gases, firearms, and the most frightening weapon of 
all, righteous indignation. He tends to be stupid, and un- 
educated, and very aware of his shortcomings, although 
he doesn’t appreciate people’s comments on them. He 
travels in packs or gangs, and feels a certain degree of se- 
curity when he is with his own kind. His word is taken 
without question in all courts, and he relies on this. 
When unarmed and confronted by a police officer, you 
must take all these factors into consideration, before decid- 
ing what course of action you intend to follow. Most indi- 
vidual confrontations between police and individuals take 
place in the street. If you are black, Puerto Rican, or white 
with long hair, you can expect this. Cops have the legal 
right to stop and frisk any person, in suspicious circum- 
stances. Suspicious circumstances are solely the cop’s in- 
terpretation. He can always bust you for something like 
disturbing the peace, or disorderly conduct, and then throw 
in a resisting-arrest charge. 
I can fully appreciate the fury and anger that a person 
can feel when put through a humiliating experience by a 
cop, but I would recommend strongly that a person main- 
tain his cool, and in no circumstances lose his temper. If 
you lose your temper, you are playing right into the cop’s 
hands. 
The cop will probably ask you a bunch of questions: 
Name? Address? What you are doing? Where you are go- 
ing? Etc. I would suggest that you answer all his questi'ons, 
although you are not legally bound to. In no circumstances 
should you answer any questions about drugs truthfully 
(unless you have none and have never used them). By re- 
fusing to answer questions, you will antagonize the cop, 
and probably get yourself busted for loitering, or refusing 
to obey a policeman’s orders. Be polite and concise, but do 
not give any information that is not asked for, and in no 
circumstances use anyone else’s name. It is a good idea to 
refer to the cop as “officer,” since it helps his ego, and en- 
hances your chances of staying out of jail. 
Cops may go further than just harassment. They may 
actually assault you. In these circumstances, you still have 
no legal right to defend yourself. In these conditions stay 
calm, if possible. Do not attempt to defend yourself other 
than just to cover your groin and head. If you see an op- 
portunity to grab a nearby weapon, and are reasonably 
sure that you can be successful, then defend yourself, but 
never forget that the cop has a gun, and he has used it, 
and will use it. 
When confronted on the street by the police, a common 
emotion for a person to feel is fear. There is nothing wrong 
with this. In fact, it's quite healthy, but do not show it to 
the cop. If the cop realizes you are afraid of him, he will 
take full advantage of the situation and play on your fear. 
This doesn't mean to act belligerently, and, for God’s sake, 
do not be a high school or college lawyer, and explain to 
the cop what he can and cannot do. He can do anything, 
he’s got the gun. 
As I have stated before, I hate demonstrations. I feel 
they must be sponsored by the government to give the cops 
a heyday. But some demonstrations are necessary, al- 
though the reason for this escapes me at the moment. 
When taking part in a demonstration, you have opened 
yourself up to brutality and arrest, and you must under- 
stand this. Do not go to a peace rally thinking about peace. 
Peace is won, and respect is earned. At all mass street 
meetings, use common sense. In no circumstances carry 
drugs, cherry bombs, stink bombs, spray paint, or any 
object that might be considered a concealed weapon. These 
include penknives and nail files. I have always made it a 
policy never to take my wallet or any identification, but 
this does risk arrest for not possessing a draft card. 
If you are going to a demonstration that you think might 
POSTSCRIPT / 
155 
be violent — this means all demonstrations — do not wear 
jewelry. Women should not wear skirts, and everyone 
should wear helmets, and carry a gas mask. If you smoke, 
carry an extra pack of cigarettes with you, as it is a real 
bitch getting cigarettes in jail. 
One of the most threatening aspects of any demonstra- 
tion is the plain-clothes cops. Over the past few years they 
have proved more and more successful, and accordingly 
their numbers have increased. Plainclothes cops are not 
plainclothed, they are in disguise. Generally they try to 
grow long hair and beards but, if you have any perception 
at all, it is not hard to pick them out. If you are perform- 
ing an illegal act, be especially careful and aware of who is 
standing behind you. 
Believe it or not, if you are arrested and attempt to 
resist, and the original charge you were arrested for is 
thrown out of court, you still can be jailed for resisting ar- 
rest. So, when resisting arrest or making an attempt to 
escape, be pretty sure that you have a good chance of suc- 
cess, and never forget the gun. Many persons have man- 
aged to escape from their arresting officers during demon- 
strations, with help from their brothers and sisters creating 
confusion. 
Remember the cop doesn’t have to use the phrase, “You 
are under arrest.” He may just grab you. This act in itself 
will hold up in court as a legal arrest. The cop also has 
the prerogative of not arresting you; he may just detain you 
for questioning. Detainment can last as long as the cop likes, 
but usually it does not last more than several hours. If 
you are held for questioning, you are treated the same way 
as if you were arrested, but you have none of the legal 
rights you have if you are under arrest. 
If you are arrested, do not talk. The more you say, the 
more you will incriminate yourself, and probably other 
people as well. You have the right to remain silent, and by 
talking or trying to find out what you are charged with, 
you may make a confession, without even realizing that 
you have done so. 
There are three things you should do as soon as you are 
arrested: 
1. Shout out your name, so that somebody knows-you 
have been busted — not that he will do anything about it, 
but it helps your peace of mind. 
2. Try to remember anyone who saw you busted, since 
they may be useful as witnesses. 
3. Get and memorize the cop’s badge number and name. 
If a different cop shows up in court, and you can prove it, 
there is a good chance that the charges will be dismissed. 
At the police station, you will be booked. This is a form- 
filling-out time, where they will persist in asking every in- 
criminating question possible, and you, of course, should 
answer none of them. Although you are supposed to have 
the right to call an attorney before being questioned, don’t 
count on it. In fact, don’t count on anything at all. If you 
are lucky enough to be allowed to call a lawyer, do so im- 
mediately. if you don’t know a lawyer, and are busted in 
New York City call any of the organizations listed below 
and explain your situation. If you are communicating with 
your parents, call them at once. Parents can get you out of 
jams faster than any lawyer.

Part of being booked is the arresting officer’s filling oul 
a Vera form. This is a test to see if you qualify for a sum- 
mons. If you do, you will be released immediately and given 
a date to appear in court. Vera summonses are only given 
for nondrug-related misdemeanors. To be eligible for Vera, 
you must have someone verify your address and occupa- 
tion, by phone, to the arresting officer. The police will also 
check your previous record. This is an extremely easy sys- 
tem to beat, if you have good friends. I was arrested in 
Brooklyn, for disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. 
About a week before the bust, a friend and I had worked 
out a series of aliases and phony addresses, for just such 
occasions. The arresting officer called my friend, and asked 
him if he was indeed my father. After he had verified my 
phoney name,«address, and occupation, I was released with 
a summons, never to appear again. 
Vera works on a point system. If you manage to verify 
your existence and accumulate the correct number of 
points, you will be released. The actual scale of points ap- 
pears a few paragraphs below. 
After you are booked, if you don’t rate Vera, you will 
be taken to a larger city jail. In New York City, it is 100 
Centre Street, better known as the Tombs. The Tombs is a 
large prison, without windows. It houses about twice as 
many people as it is supposed to. This incredible over- 
156 / THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK 
crowding has resulted in bureaucracy. These impersonal 
bureaucratic systems are the really frightening aspect of 
any large city jail. Everything is performed like clock- 
work, except if you get lost. What if someone loses your 
card, and you don’t have any friends on the outside? Ab- 
surd? No, this. isn’t absurd. It has happened many times: 
A guy gets lost in the Tombs, and he’s found a year or so 
later. He was originally charged with disorderly conduct, 
which has a usual maximum sentence of 30 to 60 days. 
When he is found, he has already spent a year in jail. 
If you are under 21, in New York City you have a 
special treat in store for you — either Atlantic Ave., or 
Rikers Island. Either one of these places is many times 
worse than the Tombs. The prison officials have a great 
deal of difficulty understanding why the suicide rate is so 
high in these locations. I have a great deal ot difficulty 
understanding the prison officials. 
When you are put into a big-city jail, you will probably 
be frightened, lonely, humiliated, and completely drained 
of any spirit. This is normal. Talk to the fellow prisoners, 
write, play cards, read, doodle, do anything to keep your 
mind occupied, but above all do not verbalize your mis- 
fortune to your fellow prisoners. Each one of them has had 
similar situations, and is sick of thinking about it.

Depending on the time of day that you are arrested, the 
time will be set for your arraignment. If you are busted 
late at night, the chances are very good you will be held 
overnight. (A word of advice: If you get the choice be- 
tween the upper and lower bunks in a cell, choose the 
lower. Prisons do not turn off their lights at night, and I 
spent a sleepless night, without a mattress, with a five- 
hundred-watt bulb shining directly into my eyes.) 
The arraignment is nothing more than the judge telling 
you what you are charged with, and setting bail for you. 
You should have a lawyer present, since, if you don’t, the 
judge will assign a moron from the Legal Aid Society. If 
you can’t get a lawyer on your own, accept one from the 
Legal Aid Society, but do not let the guy make any deals 
for you. Legal Aid lawyers are notorious for wheeling and 
dealing themselves out of work, and you into jail. It is 
better to use a lawyer, rather than to attempt to defend 
yourself, because the lawyer knows all the legal hocus- 
pocus that might reduce your bail. Judges get pissed-off 
when defendants try to defend themselves. I was once 
called “a dirty layman,” when trying to defend myself in a 
civil case, by some old asshole judge. 
At the arraignment you will be required to plead guilty

or not guilty to any violation. Never plead guilty to a viola- 
tion. If necessary, you can change your plea later. If you 
are charged with a misdemeanor, you will be given an op- 
portunity to plead, but you are not required to do so. Do 
not plead on a misdemeanor. You will not be allowed to 
plead on a felony. 
In most circumstances, if the judge does not release you 
on your own recognizance (without bail), he will set a 
figure and often a cash alternative. In other words, if your 
bail is set at $500, he may only require a small percentage, 
say $50 in cash. This is good, since if you have to go to a 
bondsman it is a big hassle, and he will require incredible 
amounts of security, such as automobiles, title deeds to 
houses or property, bank books, etc. 
The best advice possible on any legal matter is (1) 
maintain your cool and temper, (2) keep your mouth shut, 
(3) get a good lawyer and call your family, and (4) never 
forget what you have been through. Allow the fear and 
loneliness, and hatred to build inside you, rather than dim- 
inish with time. Allow your passions to fertilize the seeds 
of constructive revolution. Allow your love of freedom to 
overcome the false values placed on human life. For the 
only method to communicate with the enemy is to speak 
on his own level, using his own terms. Freedom is based on 
respect, and respect must be earned by the spilling of 
blood.
