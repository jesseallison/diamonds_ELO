all know who you are whole-hearted
you download an episode often
hold down apostasy jobs
dancing sunlight in psychoanalysis
new dimension new struggle
street view drop in the dow jones
departs on facebook, twitter, google maps
can't afford allegiance
rates the 20th century expressed this
the positive forces
eliminate the common denominator
all regularities
steps toward unification
built borderless cheap even free
we farmed fish fisherman
assign values to the viewer
when streaming's easy
how we numb
used to watching
people drown
everybody elements
unraveled connection
each and every year
wasn't taken for granted
there are 14,000 planes
the amount of salmon to disappear
damns EVERYWHERE
but are there interfaces
that tell of great nature?
we often say to companies
eating themselves evolve
it becomes a threat to spark a solution
and we keep growing
attempting to reach outside
the world and make way
complicit comeback
of the collaborative
red-eye flock
don't mind stepping for clean water
the radioactive boys of dust
threaten observers
committed organic
ubiquity of gluttons
outside interference
felt like today
a fish now two blooms
mean moon phenomena
symmetries struggle cyborgs
disarm
the certainty of domination
preferred by our elders
coded origins story
defines the nowhered
mode of mud
matter provided
man analyzed Eden
then analyzed
people
the good and grave
one garden we script war
cross-hairs two tiny lines joined against
our utopia is our apocalypse
cripples water
people shelter
as if concern were an
enforced homelessness
the dream of infrastructure
limited to the global
intimately unscathed
one which does not us
we tool the endless pursuit
manufacturing a hi-tech public
sight-servers
electronics educated
the age of eyes
out of visible energies
arises art
displacing
diamonds in dystopia
the conditions that carry
fear in the patient
superb skin
liquid parts light
the shape of your birthday
we want the real and painstaking
to draw it out as far as planets
everyone who stopped by responded
with a crisis
solution says
I would haven
withholding petroleum
mediated population
who doubt today
many need its waste
while death builds its answers
I'm gonna compare stars
go adaptable
25 microbes without
we do we knowledge
come on Earth
media
toxic therapy
discuss this expense
irrigating minds
the one prototype for change
more giving systems
sea-deep leaks
the justice problem when
I start talking about failure
won't fix the fissures
we started for our children
joined in diameter
drilling their blue stage flame
80% hydrated victorious
spent to give and give
I dim forever
to touch it for a minute
