midnight revealed the words I reserved for you

1.

it is dawn almost 

ripples the reflection of stars on water

who hands me this familiar lament from elsewhere?

awake trembling the midnight attune

2.

are you who I found to lose my way ?

I skipped past asking two travelers lost

inside the remains of shrinking shadows

where the borders of love already disguised

3.

lest I become drunk quenching my thirst

cries alone on the river bank like drunks 

parched by our intensity

lest the river dries, truth unquenched

4.

palpitations of my heart startle even the hummingbird 

undulating, in your thrumming tunes

who are you?

an unfinished canvas, awaiting a final gesture

5.

dissatisfaction drips out my eyes ever since they opened

kajal smudges ajar the day

disheveled craving the fix of your few lines

unbeknownst to me unsent in ignorance (carelessly withheld)

6.

rain's coming even if you're not

still as this air devoid of the desire to write

missing each singing sip cannot abridge the day

you delay with darkness clouds impart

7.

sunset sweat swaddles your forehead

transfixed my eyes urge me to pat away

the profuse vanishing from excuse 

what dusk's shadows and I banished from touch

8.

what was once your crater now overflows 

full by this flood's rapids lull trees down

a rocking chair awaits on the other side

carefully across, you will sit and rinse your wounds

9.

let what remains stay

it will not thrive in a new home

thrills sheltered by the silence of once

exactly where the wrenching held, here

10.

let's find peace another way tonight

we breathe in unison, my head on your chest

cricket chirps seep over darkness

dripping leaf-ladled water on my cheek

trickles between your fingers

until my fingers find your lips to say

don't spill it. I hear already.
