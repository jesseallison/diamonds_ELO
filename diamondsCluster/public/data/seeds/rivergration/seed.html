<p style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">midnight revealed the words I reserved for you</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>it is dawn almost </p>

<p>ripples the reflection of stars on water</p>

<p>who hands me this familiar lament from elsewhere?</p>

<p>awake trembling the midnight attune</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>are you who I found to lose my way ?</p>

<p>I skipped past asking two travelers lost</p>

<p>inside the remains of shrinking shadows</p>

<p>where the borders of love already disguised</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>lest I become drunk quenching my thirst</p>

<p>cries alone on the river bank like drunks </p>

<p>parched by our intensity</p>

<p>lest the river dries, truth unquenched</p>

<p>4.</p>

<p>palpitations of my heart startle even the hummingbird </p>

<p>undulating, in your thrumming tunes</p>

<p>who are you?</p>

<p>an unfinished canvas, awaiting a final gesture</p>

<p>5.</p>

<p>dissatisfaction drips out my eyes ever since they opened</p>

<p>kajal smudges ajar the day</p>

<p>disheveled craving the fix of your few lines</p>

<p>unbeknownst to me unsent in ignorance (carelessly withheld)</p>

<p>6.</p>

<p>rain's coming even if you're not</p>

<p>still as this air devoid of the desire to write</p>

<p>missing each singing sip cannot abridge the day</p>

<p>you delay with darkness clouds impart</p>

<p>7.</p>

<p>sunset sweat swaddles your forehead</p>

<p>transfixed my eyes urge me to pat away</p>

<p>the profuse vanishing from excuse </p>

<p>what dusk's shadows and I banished from touch</p>

<p>8.</p>

<p>what was once your crater now overflows </p>

<p>full by this flood's rapids lull trees down</p>

<p>a rocking chair awaits on the other side</p>

<p>carefully across, you will sit and rinse your wounds</p>

<p>9.</p>

<p>let what remains stay</p>

<p>it will not thrive in a new home</p>

<p>thrills sheltered by the silence of once</p>

<p>exactly where the wrenching held, here</p>

<p>10.</p>

<p>let's find peace another way tonight</p>

<p>we breathe in unison, my head on your chest</p>

<p>cricket chirps seep over darkness</p>

<p>dripping leaf-ladled water on my cheek</p>

<p>trickles between your fingers</p>

<p>until my fingers find your lips to say</p>

<p>don't spill it. I hear already.</p>
