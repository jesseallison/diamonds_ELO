Episode III: The Blinking Red Light
By: Christopher Shipman
From: The Movie My Murderer Makes: Season II (The Cupboard, 2018)

We open on a snowy evening. The leaves
are eating each other so white. A word
is repeated between the teeth, like a mother
who bites her child after the child bites
a sibling. Like a gift that keeps on giving.
Jump cut to the Christmas tree twinkle-
twinkling. Jump cut to five years old. Jump cut
to me behind the liner notes. See through
the eye of the tattered angel tilted at the top
of the fake tree. See through the history
of a living room. See like the sun sees dust
when it slants through the window
in the door. See as dingy cloth sees. There,
my grandfather is preparing for death
with a 1,001 naps. Behind his red recliner
my murderer helps me unwrap a present.
A feeling you should have is like the feeling
of taking the family video (playing for no one
in particular) from the VCR and flinging it
like a sheeted ghost at my grandfather's face
of raked leaves. His voice the scrape of shovel
against sidewalk. His skin, snow packed
thick as a winter of fears, collecting. See me
hide in the eyes hiding in trees so white.
I am a child. I am a dying camera.
