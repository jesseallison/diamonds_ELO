<p style="font-size: 11pt;">From: The Movie My Murderer Makes: Season II (The Cupboard, 2018)</p>

<p>Episode III: The Blinking Red Light </p>

<p>We open on a snowy evening. The leaves </p>

<p>are eating each other so white. A word </p>

<p>is repeated between the teeth, like a mother </p>

<p>who bites her child after the child bites </p>

<p>a sibling. Like a gift that keeps on giving. </p>

<p>Jump cut to the Christmas tree twinkle-</p>

<p>twinkling. Jump cut to five years old. Jump cut </p>

<p>to me behind the liner notes. See through </p>

<p>the eye of the tattered angel tilted at the top </p>

<p>of the fake tree. See through the history </p>

<p>of a living room. See like the sun sees dust </p>

<p>when it slants through the window </p>

<p>in the door. See as dingy cloth sees. There, </p>

<p>my grandfather is preparing for death </p>

<p>with a 1,001 naps. Behind his red recliner </p>

<p>my murderer helps me unwrap a present. </p>

<p>A feeling you should have is like the feeling </p>

<p>of taking the family video (playing for no one </p>

<p>in particular) from the VCR and flinging it </p>

<p>like a sheeted ghost at my grandfather's face </p>

<p>of raked leaves. His voice the scrape of shovel </p>

<p>against sidewalk. His skin, snow packed </p>

<p>thick as a winter of fears, collecting. See me </p>

<p>hide in the eyes hiding in trees so white. </p>

<p>I am a child. I am a dying camera.</p>
