ON THE DAYS THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING TO BE
HOPEFUL FOR I HAVE NOTHING TO BE HOPEFUL FOR

From: EVERYTHING IS / TERRIBLE BUT / I LOVE YOU (The Magnificent Field, 2018)

And the sun rises

And the sun sets

And the sun rises

And the sun sets

I am alive weather

Moving like water

Headless, unhooved

I want it or not

When the light goes up

On a phalanx of scars

I never cut anything

But the me inside me burns

Rotten fire

A bevy of bees in place

Heatwave trapped in shape

If I dont scream the me inside me

Will fuse with my skin and Ill never

Ill never never

Dont you hear the world

Help

I count my dresses

I slather my face

Under the rabbits white stare

The answer is

Feed the rabbits

And then youll never

Be alone

I pull out a handful of hair

Feed the rabbits

Cute is a lack of intelligence

I have never been cute

And Im sorry

I regret all of the times

I was right

Feed the rabbits

Suffer the black vein

Pumping through opalescent dawn mist

Your stock is rising

Art deco

Concrete and steel

Blushing with black blood

A little cosmetic work

For the opening

At the base of the sycamore

I press my belly to the wet grass

I dig holes in the lawn

For a week

There arent any worms

The ground

A supply chain

All the birds fall

From the sky

Like they promised

Red flag!

Red flag!

I am afraid to leave

Any spaces unstocked

I am burning in my brain pan

The cool rain of assembly

A closet of industry

I just want to belong

Every evening

I wallow in the light

From the screen

Turn my horns into my hair

Its all in your mind

You know

You can choose to be happy

You know

Under the blue tarp

Amongst a pile of mechanical lies

Tools gathered and learned

But I really only know how to work

The rabbits

I am crawling with myself

I am crawling with myself

Where is the red button

I escape into an air-conditioned room

Full of ammunition

Metal feels good on the skin

I throw bullets at the floor

Until Im walking on a carpet of fear

There are rabbits in my pockets

There are rabbits in my light

I cant get the shot

God help me I cant get the shot

If I could just pull back

This one board

And see myself like I did

As a girl

Fingering the black vein

Like an antennae

I put my body next to hers

And the sun didnt care who

Rose first
