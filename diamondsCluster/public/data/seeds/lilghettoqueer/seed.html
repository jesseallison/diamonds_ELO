<p>Been one straight-laced, do-gooding thief for years now  </p>

<p>                   No shame in the game</p>

<p>Cuz I love my miracles but wheres my wishes? I love my miracles but wheres my wishes? </p>

<p>I love my miracles but wheres my wishes? </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>I said I love my tunnels but wheres my bridges? I said I love my channels but wheres my switches?  </p>

<p>Said I love my bottoms but wheres my switches? Said I love my Cancers but wheres my fishes? </p>

<p>I said every day is miserable but its all good. Wepa. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">But didnt you start by saying… </p>

<p>No not at all / no not at all / no not at all / no not at all / that was decades ago. That was whenever ago. The hood has a long memory and so should you. And if I aint never lied, I aint never lived. Been living a con since conception but Im here for the long game not a long time. Its all means to an end and then may rebirth be kind. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>Its always brightest before the dusk then the stars step in, one-up, and go hard even behind buildings. Out of sight but always on the mind cuz everybody needs a guide  a beacon to call down ghost and aliens alike. </p>

<p>Anybody to undress the wolves, anybody to say  the moon rejects sheep. To say the moon is full up on some bullshit. To say the moon when it comes through it comes through new, black, with no more room for writing. Fuck the white space and fuck the margins too. The moon will pass when need be but dont dont think the dark side wont start to show. Dont start nothing / wont be nothing. Once again, its light come at dawn on that shit again. Dont trust the sun. Got nothing to say to the head-star in charge trying best to bring shadows to the side of the bright. The earth been circling this hot air for too long now. But at the end of the day dont forget everybody out here who been waiting to get to the end of it. Waiting for the sun to scram. Be out. Thou art a scandal. Get thee behind me and let me get to a conclusion, my nigga. Let me forget where I started but yall best take inventory of all my names from K to Z. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Aint nobody got to be a nice person </p>

<p>I aint pushing pollen. This aint honey. So what yall really want? </p>

<p>Smiles or sighs? Smiles or sighs? Smiles or sighs? </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Aint really with it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">No not at all / no not at all / no not at all /no not at all </p>

<p>This train broke the tracks </p>

<p>This vein slit the wrists</p>

<p>Blood got better places to be </p>

<p>Thoughts need a tangent </p>

<p>Cant hang around where hands are out</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">No not today / no not this year </p>

<p>Decades ago  born into the blackout  '77 aint give a fuck on Bronx streets light/dark, big or little niggas</p>

<p>Now, who we be? Bhatty boys reppin Flatbush  street after street  block to block. Intersections that aint familiar no more. Our junctions are disjointed. Nostrand lost its “nos”. Wheres a Church Ave when you need it? Wheres that old sense of loss in these times of still not having shit? </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What these riches want from a nigga? </p>

<p>Jesus saved all his best for himself. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What these switches want from a nigga? </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">When kids was getting they ass beat</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">What the fuck a belt / a strap want from a nigga? </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Wasnt life punishment enough? </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Wepa. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Why yall still on that ass when ask is all </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Anybody ever did? </p>

<p>No reason to preach. Nothing to apologize for either </p>

<p>Made my mistakes with myself as my own hypeman</p>

<p>For all my fronting, never call a façade phony </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Came down / came out </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Queer as thunder</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">What that mean? </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing but its worth a lot</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And I been silent ever since </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Except for this long ass shit. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Im just trying to make wrong fight for right</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Out here trying to get it twisted / trying to turn it around</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">trying to bring it all together </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Dread this world / cornrow the hood / braid the broke / plait the poor</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Take the cat out the tree introduce it to the dog. Give up the mouses hideout</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Escort the roaches to the end of days. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">God aint never been ride or die. He aint never stood by his man even when his man was himself. He aint got no friends. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">No not at all /no not at all</p>
