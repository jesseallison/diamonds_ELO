Eyes

Bottle

You

collected the eyes of every fish you ever speared    

                 fancied finger licking women

                 done made a habit out of where you live

sit on them eyeballs

shit them

                 stored in empty wine bottles

                 on the rack next to where the best rest

have to humiliate me right 

   wish to high heaven you do again

                be nobody to butt heads with after that                

   nothings sweeter than wheat dying in the sun

swinging elbows for cash and checks

soliciting sex with cheese

                  broke wrenched you

                  suppers in the sand

pretending swamps behind my ears

sassy as a jaybird

bulge with restless words

stole from mamas lower lip

              

the first fireevery time you get ashore

   clothesline strings salt out the wind

hoped in vain

could preserve time

rinse your skin

dont count the bottles

                  or the eyes in those bottles

                  

   at your funeral, package you in eyes

   everything you ever took casts you off
